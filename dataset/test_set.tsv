1999	"“The year is nineteen-ninety-nine.”
That sentence brings me back to my senior kindergarten class when I was five years old, where we used to read out the date on the blackboard every single day. The year 1999 exists as a stain in my mind, however, as a memory that will not go away no matter how I try to forget it. 1999 marked the year I lost my first tooth, my first time on a plane, and unfortunately the early loss of my childhood innocence.
That one memory that refuses to be wiped, it all started with that new (or old) TV. At that time Pokémon was the latest fad to hit the school. Pokémon cards, games, stickers, and the most popular, the TV show. So, of course, every time I came home from school, I would stay glued to the TV until Pokémon came on at five. The only problem was that my dad watched the news at 5:30, and Pokémon episodes were back-to-back, which meant I had to miss an episode every day, something I whined on and on about. My dad got tired of hearing me complain every day, that must be why he went and bought another TV.
My dad put the TV he bought in my room. Unfortunately, it was just an old, small boob tube, with rabbit ears even. It also only had 20 channels available; not including the channel Pokémon was on. I recall I didn’t care, though. I was just thrilled I had my own TV in my room. After surfing through the channels, I came to the conclusion that only channel 2 (TVO kids) was worth watching so I watched that for a while. It wasn’t for another few months until I discovered channel 21. One day in April, I was flipping through the channels, trying to see if Pokémon was on. I pressed channel 21 into the remote, hoping there were more channels, and to my delight there was. My dad was surprised too, but he let me watch it because it seemed to have kids programs on. The channel was called Caledon Local 21 and later I found out it was indeed broadcasted from the town of Caledon, Ontario, a town very close to my city.
The shows I saw on Caledon Local 21 looked poorly made, and I never understood what was going on in them half the time. However as I grew up, every time I thought of that channel, I realized more and more how messed up the shows were and I had to ask myself, “What the fuck was I watching?”
The following is a list of shows and episodes I remember seeing on Caledon Local 21, how I remember such detail even disturbs me, but I guess things like this stand out in your mind for a while. The channel only ran a few shows, probably because it was only operational between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm.
April 1999
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 12: Very sketchy name if you were to look at it nowadays. The show featured a guy wearing a bear mascot costume who would get a new visitor into his cellar every day. (It was always a kid) The show was filmed with a camcorder, and not a very good one either. The police asked me a lot of questions about this show. This episode started with Mr. Bear sitting at a table playing checkers by himself. He sat there playing for a bit until there was a knock on the door. The camera was then looking up the stairs at the door, where there was another knock. Mr. Bear climbed the stairs and opened the door to reveal two young children. One was a boy about my age, and the other was a girl who looked about eight.
Mr. Bear danced in delight, and then started talking to the kids; I couldn’t hear any of them that well, I remember. Mr. Bear then led the kids into the cellar, which was quite dark, only lit by a small oil lamp on the table. I can’t really remember that much more, except him singing a song which I couldn’t hear too well either (Probably because of that large bear mask). The episode ended with them playing hide-and-seek, with the kids hiding in a closet and Mr. Bear counting.
May 1999
Soup and Spoon: I don’t think this was even a show, I think it was more of a special movie thing. All I know is I stopped watching Caledon Local 21 for a while because I thought this show was too stupid, especially since Pokémon now came on at 4:30 and 5:00. I don’t remember much of this, but it showed a can of soup and a spoon both attached to strings, swinging back and forth, as if someone was holding them and dangling them in front of the camera. Interestingly enough, the show was shot in a basement, which looked just like the one used in Mr. Bear’s Cellar. Like I said, I can’t remember much, the only thing I can remember clearly was the end.
The entire thing was only half an hour, and just included stuff I found stupid, such as the spoon chasing the soup around trying to “Eat him”. The ending showed a table and about seven kids sitting around it, each with a bowl of soup in front of them. They were sitting and looking at the camera, but with confused, almost frightened faces. The cameraman then held the can of soup in front of the kids and said, “Spooooons ready?” And then it just stopped.
July 1999
It was summer, and I hadn’t watched channel 21 for a while, until one day when I slept over at my friend’s house, and I decided to check it out again. My friend had gotten a TV in his room for his sixth birthday, so we stayed up very late (for us, 9:30 was very late) and watched TV. That’s when I remembered channel 21 and brought it up to my friend. We decided to see if it was on, and to our surprise it was (they must have changed the broadcasting time).
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 23: This episode was entertaining for my friend and me, mainly because it had swearing. However, now when I think of this episode, I realize something was definitely wrong when it was filmed. The episode started with the camera on its side, while it was facing Mr. Bear, who was walking upstairs to the cellar door. The camera then blacked out for about a second, before fading in, back upright, and facing Mr. Bear. There was also another kid talking to him, but this kid looked about eleven or twelve.
He was talking to Mr. Bear for a while, but I couldn’t hear well (Again with the crappy camcorder) until the kid started raising his voice. The kid was saying how it was late and his sister had to go home, you could also hear more voices in the background. I remember Mr. Bear clearly saying “Get the fuck out, you’re not invited.” with a deep voice muffled by the bear mask. I remember my friend and I looking at each other and laughing at the mention of the forbidden F word, but the episode got weirder. The kid began climbing the stairs before turning around and saying how he was going to call the police. Mr. Bear began breaking into a run towards the kid, who started screaming and running as well. The camera then cut out, and that was the end of the episode. The channel then turned to static shortly after.
August 1999
I didn’t want to watch channel 21 after that. In August I grew more curious to see Mr. Bear’s cellar for some reason though. The last episode I saw of Mr. Bear was weird and had swearing, which also made me think the show was meant for teenagers. Nonetheless, I flipped onto channel 21 when my dad was busy.
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 28: Apparently this episode had been playing the entire month of August. It was studied a lot by the police. The entire episode was just Mr. Bear sitting in a chair talking to the audience. “Hello, kids! Do you want to visit my cellar? If you do, please write me a letter at this address!” The screen then switched to a white screen with multi-colored letters reading the address, and that was what remained for the rest of the episode. This repeated for five hours every day until September came.
And guess what I actually did? I sent “Mr. Bear,” or that sick bastard who portrayed him a letter. I did it out of curiosity mostly; my dad was OK with it because he thought it was a legit kid show, but then again he never saw any of what was on channel 21. So I wrote a letter using my best writing possible, I think I just said how I wanted to meet Mr. Bear. So my dad sent the letter to the address Mr. Bear said on the show (it stayed on all day anyway for some reason).
It took about a week to get a response, which I was surprised I did. I still have the letter I received on August 15, 1999. The letter read:
Dear Elliot,
Thank you ever so much for your letter, I would love to have you in my cellar! We play games, watch movies, and go fire camping in the middle of the woods!
Come to my house at (the police cut out this address), Caledon, Ontario, Canada.
I look very forward to having fun with you!
Love, Mr. Bear
I cannot believe my dad never found this sketchy, because he actually took me to the house. And then that’s when the police became involved, those endless questions, those pictures of terrified kids, the woods…
That brings me to why I’m writing this blog. That psycho and his friends did some fucked up shit back then, and now it seems he’s trying to get into contact with me again,. The entire police thing is coming back. That has brought 1999 back to me. Over a decade later, it is happening again.
[Update] – November 14, 2009
People have been emailing me asking what exactly happened in 1999, I will get to that. Those weird TV shows I was watching apparently were meant to attract kids to Mr. Bear’s house, what Mr. Bear did shocked the entire town.
My dad actually drove me to Caledon along with the address Mr. Bear left on the letter. The house was actually in the outskirts of the town, in the open farmland. I still remember that house. It looked like an older farmhouse that looked to have been built in the early 1900s. The windows were all boarded up, and the house looked in a state of disrepair. As we walked up to the house, I remember my dad checking the address over and over again and looking at the house in disbelief. Then the door opened.
I expected Mr. Bear to be at the door, but I was surprised to see a police officer emerge from the creaking doorway. The officer began talking to my dad, while I quickly asked if that was Mr. Bear’s house. The officer’s face cringed slightly, and he muttered, “Oh God,” or something like that. He started talking quietly to my dad so I couldn’t hear, although my dad told me to go to the car anyway. And then we just went home. My dad was quiet the whole way home. I felt something strange had happened.
My dad never told me what happened for a while, I forgot about it anyway too. Channel 21 no longer came on, and when I asked about it my dad would not acknowledge its existence. I think it was when I was 13 where I learned the truth. I remembered channel 21 one day and asked my dad about it. I guess he finally decided I should hear the truth.
Caledon Local 21 was a local TV channel that ran from October 1997-August 1999 in the Peel Region of Ontario. The entire channel was made from a house in Caledon (The one I visited) and run by a man who was not really known by anyone in the town. The channel was only available to older TVs because the signal was one only picked up by rabbit ears (Weaker frequency). The man created all the shows on the channel, all of which were kid shows. He was Mr. Bear, and he was the mysterious cameraman. The real reason he created the channel was more disturbing than what was originally thought. As you might have already guessed, he kidnapped kids and held them in his cellar. But while most people thought he was a serial child molester, he really wanted to use the kids for another purpose. The day I arrived, the man had fled his house the night before, the day before the police went in for their investigation. I wasn’t the only one who was watching.
[Update] – December 2, 2009
Sorry for not answering any questions for so long, I haven’t accessed my email account for some time. Anyway, let me finally set things straight about what I know. Back in October, I visited the house previously owned by the man who ran Caledon Local 21. Two women lived there, operating a daycare business… how ironic. Now to answer the questions you guys emailed to me:
Q: Who else watched Caledon Local 21?
A: I know other people watched it for sure, including those kids who wound up at Mr. Bear’s house. After some Google searches, I found a few people on the Neoseeker forums who were discussing shows from Caledon Local 21. They talked about the two shows I watched, but also another two shows I had never seen before. A user named iamreallife seemed to know all the shows that were broadcasted on channel 21; here are the two I’ve never heard of:
The Fallen Angel and Life – iamreallife described it as a fairly boring show about a guy rambling on and on in front of the camera about how we must please Satan and appease him before it is too late.
Paint with the Soul – iamreallife and another user called sigy92 were discussing this show. They described it as “Blair Witch like” as it consisted of the cameraman wandering around a forest at night, doing nothing particularly interesting.
I’ll go looking for the conversation and see if I can get the link.
Q: Where is Mr. Bear, or the guy who wore the costume?
A: If I did know, I would have said earlier. I have no idea where this guy is, or if he’s dead or alive (hopefully dead). When I see my dad’s friend next time I will ask him about this, maybe I can get a more definite answer.
Q: What did Mr. Bear do to the children?
A: This is by far the most common question I’ve been asked. I found this out in October as well, via my dad’s friend who is a retired Caledon regional officer. Apparently, the man playing Mr. Bear took the kids out of the house and into the forest nearby. What he did there, police are not exactly sure how it happened, but 16 charred bodies of children between the ages of 4-13 were found in a 15-by-15-foot ditch deep within the forest. My dad’s friend did not want to go into exact details, but I’m seeing him next Thursday anyway, so maybe I can extort more information from him then.
That’s all I have for now. Thanks for keeping an interest in my blog. I will try to gather as much information as I can for my next post. I’ve actually been getting pretty interested in this myself. It should be my right to know what the hell happened.
[Update] – January 14, 2010
I’m sorry I haven’t posted anything for a while, I kind of lost interest in this blog since I hit a standstill while looking for more information about the identity of the owner of Caledon Local 21.
However, a few weeks ago, I struck gold. I found some answers surprisingly from the father of a kid I used to babysit. He lives just across from my street, and I used to look after his kids when they were younger, he currently doesn’t have a job either. He used to live near the woods outside of Caledon, and witnessed the owner’s activities in the woods. His name is Anthony Pollo.
When he lived in the small bungalow outside the woods, he would often venture in to smoke a joint of marijuana or two before returning to his work as a wood craftsman. Pollo described that sometimes he would hear voices of children coming from deeper within the woods, as well as a glowing light off in the distance. Pollo told me these events started in late 1997 (Note: This is around the time Caledon Local 21 began airing). He apparently became annoyed by this happening every once in a while and actually went to investigate.
Pollo then described what the whole scene looked like when he got there. There was a group of kids (He said about 13-17) and ages 5–12 gathered around a large fire pit with a burning fire. With them was a single adult. Pollo talked to the man (Noting his unusual unkempt appearance of a crack addict, as well as his constant twitching) and asked what he was doing out in the forest with children. The man said they were on a camping trip, something they did frequently. Pollo, not suspecting anything (Caledon has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada) simply left it at that and told them to be quieter. Pollo then paused for a while before telling me that they never became quieter, in fact sometimes he heard loud chanting from the children in an unknown language. He didn’t bother meeting with the man again, as he was moving anyway.
I told Pollo that the man was probably the owner of Caledon Local 21, but he doubted it, as he heard that the man was moving to Pickering by several other residents near that area.
Here is what I know now:






I will discuss this with my dad’s friend (the ex-cop) and see if this matches anything the police knew about the man. I also want to see if he has any other knowledge of what was aired on Caledon Local 21.
[Update] – February 10, 2010
Good news guys, I talked to my dad’s friend and he disclosed a lot of information for me. First I asked if the police had any information on the man who ran Caledon Local 21, he replied that they have only had the same leads for years and never found a suspect. However, the Peel regional police do have some of the tapes found in the house Caledon Local 21 was broadcasted from, he took me over so I could watch a few. I guess I haven’t said much about him yet, my dad’s friend’s name is Mitchell Wilson, a pretty nice guy, he seems to understand my thirst for knowledge on what happened during the late 90s in that house. He feels it was wrong that my dad went so long without telling me much.
He took me to the Davis road police station (if you don’t know, it’s the largest station in Caledon, and one of the largest within the Peel region itself). Each of the main stations around Peel have some of the tapes. I was able to watch all of the footage that the Davis road station has. Unfortunately, I wasn’t allowed to take any tapes home for obvious reasons.
Paint with the Soul – Episode 10, “Garbage Thrown Away”: Paint with the Soul was one of the shows that iamrealife and sigy92 discussed on neoseeker. I told the police about this and they informed me that 12 episodes of the show were made and broadcasted between December 5, 1997′ and ‘January 8, 1998.’
Exactly as iamrealife and sigy92 described, the episode opened with the cameraman wandering around in a forest. It appeared to be during the evening as it seemed the sun was setting. The cameraman walked along a path until he got to an area where there was a lot of garbage lying in the leaves.
The camera looked around at the various wrappers, bottles, bags, and boxes, making sure each item got a few seconds of screen time. The camera then focused on a single area before the man spoke. I recall he spoke in a very timid quiet voice, and I swear I’ve heard it somewhere else before, like on another Caledon Local 21 show. I could barely hear what he was saying, but he mainly talked about how humans are garbage, or something that had to do with saving ourselves by cleaning up the garbage (us). It actually sounded really stupid, but still a feeling of dread came over me, I mean that forest was possibly where those bodies were found, right?
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 25: When the police administrator brought this tape in, I actually said “Ohhh, shit,” and chuckled a bit out loud. Of course, I got stares from the staff, but Wilson explained to them about my little experience with Mr. Bear and how I still kept the letter he sent me. Like the previous episodes, this one included a guy wearing a bear mascot costume.
The episode began with Mr. Bear waddling over to his cellar door with a bottle of orange juice in his paws. On the ground were sixteen shot glasses as well as a small bottle that contained an unknown liquid. Mr. Bear poured an equal amount of orange juice into each glass before opening the smaller bottle and depositing one drop into the glasses. Mr. Bear then went off-camera, there were some minor sounds such as shuffling, and then Mr. Bear emerged from behind the camera’s location.
Following him were 16 children. Some looked as young as four, while others looked like they were practically teenagers. As the children entered, the administrator commented that this is the only episode that showed all 16 victims.
The kids all looked rather content except for this one who had visible bruises on his face, and unlike the other kids, he had a more fearful expression. He also looked about 11-12, which caused me to recognize him. He was the kid who had asked about his sister and subsequently met an unknown fate at the end of episode 23, that one episode I watched during July 1999.
When I told the administrator this, he confirmed it was the same kid. He was also featured in episode 24, an episode that only aired once at 3:00 in July 1999 (the police have still not found the tape). Mr. Bear then broke into song, singing about citrus fruits and how good vitamin C was for you (I could barely hear the lyrics as they were muffled by the bear mask). The kids all drink their juice (the one from episode 23 doing it rather reluctantly), and the episode ended.
After viewing the tapes in possession of the Davis Road police station, I’m satisfied but only temporarily. I still want to know the full story. The police just keep giving me the same crap about the creator of Caledon Local 21 being a fetishist pedophile as well as an apparent cultist. I will sign off for now, get into university first, and get information later. Hopefully, I will get back to this blog as soon as possible.
[Update] – May 8, 2010
Last month, I finally got my G2 license (in Ontario, Canada, this allows you to drive in a car by yourself as well as with some passengers after 6 months). I, of course, took advantage of this and drove into Caledon for a little “Sunday drive.” Since I haven’t updated this blog in a while, I figured I might as well visit the house where the infamous channel of my childhood was located. The house looked different than when I last saw it in October. The place was no longer used as a daycare, and just sat there abandoned. However, it did have a “For Sale” sign showing that someone still owned it, wanting to get rid of it, though.
The abandoned house drew fuzzy memories from my mind, mainly of that day my dad took me to visit Mr. Bear. A feeling of dread came upon me. What happened to the children while they were living in that house? I walked up the steps to the front door and peered through the window. Inside I could see a nearly empty hallway with a few boxes at the end.
At the end of the hallway to the right was an open doorway presumably leading to the kitchen. To the left were two doors, both apparently leading to the rooms visible through the windows outside. I wondered where the cellar entrance was located and whether it had been sealed up. I walked around to the back of the house and found my answer. Two wooden doors lying at an almost flat angle were padlocked shut; this had to lead to the cellar. Not wanting to hang around (you cannot imagine what was going through my mind at that time), I departed.
Behind the house, the empty field continued on until it reached a dense forest that lined the horizon. I wondered if that was the forest where the bodies of the children were found. I thought to myself “Fuck it” and proceeded to walk across the field behind the house into the forest. The forest was oddly quiet, save for the few periodic sounds of a woodpecker drilling into a distant tree. I cautiously made my way deeper into the woods, not really caring about the fact that I had no idea where I was going. I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt like there was something I had to find. I came to a thinner part of the woods and few small houses in the distance. Pollo’s house crossed my mind and I wondered if one of these homes had belonged to him. I neared a small clearing in which I could see 3 adequately sized logs gathered around a black, charred area (showing a small fire had been lit there recently).
“HEY! GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR FORT!” Those words nearly gave me a heart attack. I turned to my left and saw two dark-clothed people running towards me. My initial thought was to run, however as they came closer I saw they were really just kids in their early teens, possibly 13 or 14, maybe even 12. As they approached me, they realized my size as well. I’m 6’ 1”, while they could have been no bigger than 5’ 8” (one might have been 5’ 7”).
“We said… get the fuck out,” the larger one who was wearing a Slipknot shirt said half-heartedly. I stood my ground and shrugged. The shorter one who was wearing a Metallica shirt swung out a butterfly knife and held it in my direction.
“No, you wouldn’t want to,” I said in a deep, serious tone (trying to sound as badass as possible). I pulled out my cell phone.
The two kids withdrew, the one in the Metallica shirt putting away the knife. “Look, dude, we don’t like people in our fort, so can you just go?” the one in the Slipknot shirt said, obviously intimidated. I had no business in the forest anyway, so I uttered out a simple “fine” and turned before I realized I had a great opportunity.
“Did either of you hear of a guy who murdered a bunch of kids in these woods about… 13 years ago?” I asked the kids. The two looked at each other in confusion, before the one wearing the Metallica shirt answered.
“Yeah… everyone knows about that guy,” he said to me as if I were stupid. The kid in the Slipknot shirt continued, “He still lives around here, in the storm drain… my big brother’s friend says he saw him in a bear costume once, wandering around the forest at night.”
My instincts told me this was probably a lie, and the owner of Caledon Local 21 is probably long gone, only existing as folklore in this smaller isolated community. However, as a human, the thought of the mysterious unknown sparks interest within. “And where is the storm drain?” I asked (Just out of curiosity, I don’t actually believe the kid’s story). The Kid in the Metallica shirt stared at me for a few moments, his eyes seemingly full of annoyance, yet curiosity for me. “You’re not from around here, are you? Why did you even come here?” Now, I do admit I was slightly startled by the nature of his question. However, I figured I might as well explain why I was there, just in case people mistook my intentions. I told the two kids about my experience with the man and Caledon local 21, and that I had to come to maybe seek out some sort of closure (although though even I wasn’t exactly sure).
The kids seemed familiar with the channel as they smiled and looked at each other when I mentioned it. They also became more understanding and gave me a detailed description on how to get to the storm drain. Shortly after, I decided to just turn around the way I came and head back to the house, leaving the kids at their fort. But now you’re probably wondering why I left out such detail about what the kids told me just now, it is it because I’m choosing to conclude what I have gathered now.
Here is what the kids told me in detail:






Thanks for continuing to support me and my blog. I know many are looking forward to more information about what happened in Caledon during the year 1999, and I will do my best to continue my research into the topic. Elliot out.
[Update] – October 7, 2010
Wow, nearly five months since I last updated. I’m guessing everyone pretty much thinks I was dead right? Thankfully I’m not. But in all my seriousness, I really have been busy these past few months, and a blog about something that could have killed me as a kid is a little low on my current priorities list. As of now, I am living in Waterloo, Ontario, attending the University of Waterloo for computer engineering (yeah, I’m a keener). As you can imagine, engineering is no walk in the park, so obviously I nearly forgot about this blog. But as you can see now, I am back.
I remembered to visit the storm drain the kids from the Caledon forest told me about. It was out in a clearing between the wooded areas, nearby a marsh. Unfortunately, I found absolutely nothing; save for a turtle that retreated into its built-in home when it saw me. I snapped some pics of the pipe which I have posted as well. Also, let me tell you it was NOT a storm drain like they said it was.
What I saw was a simple pipe, possibly to channel the access water from the marsh. When I returned from Caledon however, I simply kept putting off uploading everything until I forgot all about my blog. It just didn’t seem important anymore (Please forgive me). It wasn’t until only recently that I am now interested in my case again. On September 10th, I received an email from this email address: returntheb@hotmail.com
Funny, am I right? Well, it gets better. I’m going to copy and paste the exact email this guy sent me:
Dear Elliot,
My dear, dear boy,
You see this story may or may not be true but it could happen. There are many slots for air time, if you have money you can have a public access TV channel. Some public accsess channels share air time like EWTN (Religouse channel based out of Michigan) That shows Catholic based programming but during off air hours have independant shows or just blue screen. Cable networks have emty channels available for rent space. So the scenario of a pedo renting a channel on basic TV is not far fetch at all. However public access TV is widley reveiwed and can be teminated at anytime. (These are the rules for the United States not for Canada where this story took place) So if this happened in the US the pedo would be tracked and arrested emedatly. Yes this story could happen but it is unlikely.
100 fuzzy hugs,
Mr. Bear
Now obviously this letter is fake and sounds almost corrupted, but still, I would like to thank whoever sent it — though they could use some English lessons. Just reading this letter creeped me out, but because of it, I am now full of this new interest to continue my blog. I guess it’s just funny trying to pursue the mysteries I’ve always questioned. Now my roommate knows about all of this. He thought the letter was real and actually seemed more scared than I was for a second. But then I shrugged it off, so he did too. I mean, what are the chances of this being real? How would “Mr. Bear” know all this about public access TV, and about when I went to Caledon on those occasions? More or less know my email or me still be interested in his cellar. Ha.
I’m going to send a reply to “returntheb.” Wow, just looking at the email address, you can tell someone wanted to freak me out. It didn’t really work, though. Although, to whomever you are, thank you for sparking my interest back into the full matter. Maybe I can find out more about what happened to “Mr. Bear,” hopefully, because although I don’t buy that email, a part of me still feels anxious. Thank you to all those who are still following me and have become avid fans, you are also why I am choosing to continue this!
Thanks, guys.
[Update] – November 7, 2010
Wow, I can’t believe this blog hasn’t been deleted yet, I haven’t posted anything for so long. I have my reasons and I’d rather not discuss them just yet, it has been a rather… traumatic year for me. Some of you were right, I shouldn’t have gone back trying to relive the mysteries of my childhood, but I couldn’t resist. It has been over a year since my last post and a lot has happened. Let’s recap where I’m at right now with regards to the whole “Mr. Bear” incident.






I guess I just wanted to say I am continuing this blog and thank you for everyone who still follows it. I don’t know when my next entry will be, but when I see that tape I’ll write what I find. I don’t know what to expect, but the idea of seeing another tape has gotten me interested in this whole mystery all over again.

[Update] – January 21, 2011
It has been a long year for me. University has been giving me the usual sleepless nights especially since I transferred to Ottawa which is the place to party (sarcasm). But now I’m back home with my dad in Brampton, the town I grew up in. I got home on the 18th of December and have been visiting with friends and family, or at least that’s what I would rather have done. Now that festive holiday cheer that I usually have at this time of the month is absent.
To answer the hundreds of emails and comments I got – yes I did see the tapes that my dad’s friend (Mitchell Wilson) promised to show me. These tapes, however, act as a curse; I want to know more, yet I want to forget everything. I couldn’t help it; I needed to see those tapes. Not only for myself, but for all of you guys who are just as intrigued as I am by that ominous man in a bear suit from my past. However, after viewing those tapes, I feel that pit of dread deep inside me once again, that feeling where I know that all those kids in those videos are dead, that I could have been one of those kids, and that humanity is a dark, dark place. If you haven’t skipped this paragraph for the “juicier” details below, thank you for listening to my rambling.
On January 1st, I called Mitchell Wilson and asked if there was a time where I could come by and view the tapes. Things were pretty slow at the station because of a snowstorm so he said I could come down anytime that day. The tapes were located at a branch not too far from me. So I braved the slushy roads and terrible Brampton drivers and made my way to the Peel regional police station located at the Bramalea city center.
I met Wilson at the front desk where he then led me up to the second floor and into a small office. He instructed me to have a seat and wait while he went and got the tapes. Before leaving the office he turned to me and said, “I know you’re curious but… are you sure you want to do this?”
Of course I did, or at least thought so. Besides, Wilson’s friend had pulled a lot of strings to get me in there and I didn’t want to waste the opportunity. This particular station had two tapes on hand. I was only able to watch a few minutes of footage, however, because the second tape was apparently too damaged to be played on a VCR.
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 30: Mr. Bear never ceases to disturb me, especially after what almost happened when I was younger. This episode took place outside in a forest at dusk, making it slightly hard to see especially considering the quality of the film (A trademark of anything from Caledon Local 21). The episode started with the camera being held in the “paws” of Mr. Bear aiming it at himself.
That bear mask… it looked more sinister in the shadows of the trees. The unmistakable muffled voice spoke up; “Hello children! Today I will be doing a wonderful thing for my friends, I will be delivering them to a faraway land where they will surely be happy!” Mr. Bear turned the camera around to show an ATV with an attached trailer, but what stood out the most was that the trailer contained seven motionless children lying side by side. “T-this here is the first load, but more will be on their way soon!” Mr. Bear turned around and pointed the camera at a large burlap tarp spread on the ground.
He picked the tarp up revealing a large hole that must have been at least 12 feet deep and maybe about 15 feet wide. The rest of the episode consisted of Mr. Bear taking each kid and dropping them into the hole. I asked Wilson if they were dead to which he shook his head and replied, “Not yet.” Soon all the kids were in the pit. Some were in awkward positions due to being tossed in, but they remained unconscious. “The vitamin C will surely help these children on the great journey that awaits them!” Mr. Bear mentioned as he panned the camera towards multiple bottles of gasoline beside a bush. The camera zoomed into the bottles as Mr. Bear hummed before the episode ended.
Wilson revealed to me that these were 7 of the 16 victims found burnt to a crisp. The gasoline is what the man playing Mr. Bear used to light them on fire. A pit full of burning children… who the fuck would do that? That feeling of dread found me once again when I realized that I could have been one of those kids.
Wilson then explained to me that he had previously lied. The other tape confiscated by the Bramalea police branch did indeed work and contained the filming of the actual burning. However, he felt that I wouldn’t be able to handle the “disturbing and graphic” nature of the episode. And you know what? Maybe I can’t. I don’t even want to see it. I’m satisfied for now, but I just need some time to get myself together. The thing is, the man who ran Caledon Local 21 is still out there.
More to come soon.

Once upon a time…
There lived a boy named Elliot.
Elliot was a clever boy who loved playing with his friends.
One day, he watched a lovely television show about a bear and his children friends.
The children loved helping each other as good children should, but they also loved the bear.
The bear loved the children since the children were so good at helping him and the fallen angel.
The children and the bear wanted to play together forever with the help of their angel friend.
But the fallen angel needed even more help, so the children had to give the ultimate sacrifice.
Because that’s what friends do, Elliot.
They help each other.
Help us, Elliot, burn with us, Elliot.
I want you, Elliot, he wants you, Elliot.
Come back to my cellar.
Pretty please with sugar and icing on top!

[Update] – April 5, 2011
I wanted to update more, I truly did. However certain circumstances had turned me off the whole Caledon Local 21 thing. I’ve since then had hundreds of emails about my blog and was even in contact with a magazine about my story. But now is the time to come clean to everyone, where have I been for an entire year? The story of Pandora’s Box is true, and I opened it. I opened it when I watched the second tape in the possession of the Bramalea police branch. The other subject I’d like to address is the number of joke/fake emails I’ve been getting from people claiming to be Mr. Bear. Let’s start with the second tape, as that is what traumatized me into stopping my search temporarily.
After a few weeks of playing silent, I decided to ask Mitchell Wilson if I could view that infamous second tape he had talked about. I don’t know why. I just felt that viewing that tape would give me some closure. Wilson was obviously reluctant to show me, but I was persistent. He gave me an offer. If I was still interested by the time I turned 20 he would show me the tape. Not being able to do much else, I just played the waiting game. By the time my 20th birthday rolled around, I was definitely still interested in viewing the tape. I gave Wilson a call, during which he admitted that he had hoped that I would forget about asking him again, but I was not taking no for an answer. “You really don’t need to see it,” he kept telling me, but I did need to see it. I had to at this point. Sure enough, he invited me to the Bramalea branch one Monday afternoon. Having watched every Saw film, and a video of animal slaughterhouses in my ethics class, I was sure I would be able to handle whatever the tape could throw at me. How naive I was…
Mr. Bear’s Cellar – Episode 31: When Wilson went to collect the tape from evidence, the officer in charge of the evidence room shook his head at me, his face saying “What are you doing?” Wilson explained that this tape includes the last known episode of Mr. Bear’s cellar. I rightfully assumed that I would be seeing the fate of the children, and began to feel a sense of dread.
The episode opened inside a forest, the usual one from the previous episodes. This fact took me a while to realize because it was night, the trees and leaves just looked like shapes dancing around in the darkness. A faint glow of light was present on the right side of the screen. There wasn’t any apparent audio, it appeared to be a windy night yet the trees weren’t making any noise. Slowly, the camera began to pan towards the glow, revealing smoke rising from a hole with the tips of flames peaking over the top. Wilson paused at this point; “Are you sure you want to see this?” he asked me. I insisted on it, even though a voice in my head was telling me not to. The video continued, the cameraman moved towards the hole, showing a pit of fire. This was the hole that I had seen in the previous episode. Only this time it was filled with shapes. I could see shapes moving around, fluttering, flailing…some motionless. I knew perfectly well what they were. The camera began to adjust to the light and… burning flesh. Red, black, a blur of surreal movement and colors.  I wish I could forget what I saw, but you can’t forget a scene like this. This was not a horror movie, this was reality. Human beings were being killed in a horrifying way, a fate that I could have potentially met.
The video suddenly cut to dawn, the camera now positioned farther away from the hole. The fire was out. However, there was still smoke rising up. A figure was up ahead. I recognized it right away; the Mr. Bear suit was laid out on the ground. Empty, it looked just as unnerving. The suit was laid out in the shape of a cross. The cameraman did a lap around the suit, treating it like a treasured artifact. Placed at the head of the suit was a sign. In bold red letters, INRI was printed. The cameraman moved back to the end of the suit, zooming in to the bear’s face. The episode finally ended.
I was speechless. It was like a dream. You can find a lot of terrible things on the internet, but I had never seen anything like this. Wilson asked if I was okay and I replied with a shaky “yes.” I assured him as we left that I was fine and that the video gave me some closure over the whole incident. He didn’t seem too confident in me, but he left it at that. He was right, though – I had nightmares for weeks. I gave up. I didn’t care about the whole thing anymore. A sick man burned a bunch of kids alive, attracting them with a fake kid’s TV channel. I could have been one of his victims, yet I’m still here. I suppose I should be grateful, but I feel guilty. Am I still here only by pure luck? Ten months later I’m back, but now I need to address something else.
My email has been flooded with messages. Some people ask for more details, some ask if I can upload the tapes, and some people email me claiming to be Mr. Bear. First, I cannot get the tapes uploaded as they’re A) in police possession as evidence and B) I have no idea how to transfer VHS onto a computer. As for people pretending to be Mr. Bear, you’re not fooling me. When you have dozens of people pretending to be the same person, it doesn’t work. I’ve even seen a fake Caledon Local 21 YouTube channel, which is cute but still not real. Even more annoying is the fact that someone hacked my account just to put up some demented poem about me on this blog. I’ll leave it in the entry above this one, just to show you guys. I have contacted my webmaster about the entry and was told that it was posted on Halloween (oh, spooky!), attached to the email paintwithb@aol.com, which I assume is another joke email.
I’m over episode 31 now. The images of what I saw will stick with me for a while, but I want to do one last hurrah. I will get into contact with Mitchell Wilson again and hopefully get set up with the tapes in the possession of the other Peel Police branches. I’ll try to update you guys as soon as I can (I’m sure this won’t take so long again). Thank you to everyone who still reads this.

Ben Drowned (Haunted Majora’s Mask)	"
Part 1 – Day 4 (September 7, 2010)
Okay, /x/, I need your help with this. This is not copypasta, this is a long read, but I feel like my safety or well-being could very well depend on this. This is video game related, specifically Majora’s Mask, and this is the creepiest shit that has ever happened to me in my entire life.
Having said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college and a friend of mine gave me his old Nintendo 64 to play. I was stoked, to say the least, I could finally play all of those old games of my youth that I hadn’t touched in at least a decade. His Nintendo 64 came with one yellow controller and a rather shoddy copy of Super Smash Brothers, and while beggars can’t be choosers, needless to say it didn’t take long until I became bored of beating up LVL 9 CPUs.
That weekend I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score on some good deals from ignorant parents). I ended up picking up a copy of Pokemon Stadium, Goldeneye (fuck yeah), F-Zero, and two other controllers for two dollars. Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did, there were no cars there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I usually trust my gut on these things so I got out of the car and I was greeted by an old man. His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing. It was odd, if you asked me to tell you why I thought he was displeasing, I couldn’t really pinpoint anything – there was just something about him that put me on edge, I can’t explain it. All I can tell you is that if it wasn’t in the middle of the afternoon and there were other people within shouting distance, I would not have even thought of approaching this man.
He flashed a crooked smiled at me and asked what I was looking for, and immediately I noticed that he must be blind in one of his eyes; his right eye had that “glazed over” look about it. I forced myself to look to his left eye instead, trying not to offend, and asked him if he had any old video games.
I was already wondering how I could politely excuse myself from the situation when he would tell me he had no idea what a video game was, but to my surprise he said he had a few ones in an old box. He assured me he’d be back in a “jiffy” and turned to head back into the garage. As I watched him hobble away, I couldn’t help but notice what he was selling on his table. Littered across his table were rather… peculiar paintings; various artworks that looked like ink blots that a psychiatrist might show you. Curious, I looked through them – it was obvious why no one was visiting this guy’s garage sale, these weren’t exactly aesthetically pleasing. As I came to the last one, for some reason it looked almost like Majora’s Mask – the same heart-shaped body with little spikes protruding outward. Initially I just thought that since I was secretly hoping to find that game at these garage sales, some Freudian bullshit was projecting itself into the ink blots, but given the events that happened afterward I’m not so sure now. I should have asked the man about it. I wish I would have asked the man about it.
After staring at the Majora-shaped blot, I looked up and the old man was suddenly there again, arms-length in front of me, smiling at me. I’ll admit I jumped out of reflex and I laughed nervously as he handed me a Nintendo 64 cartridge. It was the standard grey color, except that someone had written Majora on it in black permanent marker. I got butterflies in my stomach as I realized what a coincidence this was and asked him how much he wanted for it.
The old man smiled at me and told me that I could have it for free, that it used to belong to a kid who was about my age that didn’t live here anymore. There was something weird about how the man phrased that, but I didn’t really pay any attention to then, I was too caught up in not only finding this game but getting it for free.
I reminded myself to be a bit skeptical since this looked like a pretty shady cartridge and there’s no guarantee it would work, but then the optimist inside me interjected that maybe it was some kind of beta version or pirated version of the game and that was all I needed to be back on cloud nine. I thanked the man and the man smiled at me and wished me well, saying “Goodbye then!” – at least that’s what it sounded like to me. All the way in the car-ride home, I had a nagging doubt that the man had said something else. My fears were confirmed when I booted up the game (to my surprise it worked just fine) and there was one save file named simply “BEN”. “Goodbye Ben”, he was saying “Goodbye Ben”. I felt bad for the man, obviously a grandparent and obviously going senile, and I – for some reason or another – reminded him of his grandson “Ben”.
Out of curiosity I looked at the save file. Eyeballing it, I could tell that he was pretty far in the game – he had almost all of the masks and 3/4 remains of the bosses. I noticed that he had used an owl statue to save his game, he was on Day 3 and by the Stone Tower Temple with hardly an hour left before the moon would crash. I remember thinking that it was a shame that he had come so close to beating the game but he never finished it. I made a new file named “Link” out of tradition and started the game, ready to relive my childhood.
For such a shady looking game cartridge, I was impressed at how smoothly it ran – literally just like a retail copy of the game save for a few minor hiccups here and there (like textures being where they shouldn’t be, random flashes of cutscenes at odd intervals, but nothing too bad). However the only thing that was a little unnerving was that at times the NPCs would call me “Link” and at other times they would call me “BEN”. I figured it was just a bug – a fluke in the programming causing our files to get mixed up or something. It did kind of creep me out though after a while, and it was around after I had beaten the Woodfall Temple that I regrettably went into the save files and deleted “BEN” (I had intended to preserve the file just out of respect of the game’s original owner, it’s not like I needed two files anyway), hoping that that would solve the problem. It did and it didn’t, now NPCs wouldn’t call me anything, where my name should be in the dialogue there was just a blank space (my save file name was still called “Link”, though). Frustrated, and with homework to do, I put the game down for a day.
I started playing the game again last night, getting the Lens of Truth and working my way towards completing the Snowhead Temple. Now, some of you more hardcore Majora’s Mask players know about the “4th Day” glitch – for those who don’t you can Google it but the gist of it is that right as the clock is about to hit 00:00:00 on the final day, you talk to the astronomer and look through the telescope. If you time it right the countdown disappears and you essentially have another day to finish whatever you were doing. Deciding to do the glitch to try and finish the Snowhead Temple, I happened to get it right on the first try and the time counter at the bottom disappeared.
However, when I pressed B to exit the telescope, instead of being greeted by the astronomer I found myself in the Majora boss fight room at the end of the game (the trippy boxed in arena) staring at Skull Kid hovering above me. There was no sound, just him floating in the air above me, and the background music which was regular for the area (but still creepy). Immediately my palms began to sweat – this was definitely not normal. Skull Kid NEVER appeared here. I tried moving around the area, and no matter where I went, Skull Kid would always be facing me, looking at me, not saying anything. Nothing would happen though, and this kept up for around sixty seconds. I thought the game had bugged or something – but I was beginning to doubt that very much.
I was about to reach for the reset button when text appeared on my screen: “You’re not sure why, but you apparently had a reservation…” I instantly recognized that text – you get that message when you get the Room Key from Anju at the Stock Pot Inn, but why was it playing here? I refused to entertain the notion that it was almost as if the game was trying to communicate with me. I started navigate the room again, testing to see if that was some sort of trigger that enabled me to interact with something here, then I realized how stupid I was – to even think that someone could reprogram the game like this was absurd. Sure enough, fifteen seconds later another message appeared on the screen, and again like the first one it was already a pre-existing phrase “Go to the lair of the temple’s boss? Yes/No”. I paused for a second, contemplating what I should press and how the game would react, when I realized that I couldn’t select no. Taking a deep breath, I pressed Yes and the screen faded to white, with the words “Dawn of a New Day” with the subtext “||||||||” beneath it. Where I was ported to filled me with the most intense sense of dread and impending fear I had ever experienced
The only way I can describe the way I felt here is having this feeling of inexplicable depression on a profound scale. I am normally not a depressed person, but the way I felt here was a feeling that I didn’t even knew existed – it was such a twisted, powerful presence that seemed to wash over me.
I appeared in some kind of weird twilight-zone version of Clock Town. I walked out of the Clock Tower (as you normally do when you start from Day 1) only to find that all of the inhabitants were gone. Usually with the 4th Day glitch you can still find the guards and the dog that runs around outside the tower – this time they were all gone. What replaced them was the ominous feeling that there was something out there, in the same area as me and that it was watching me. I had four hearts to my name and the Hero’s Bow, but at this point I wasn’t even considered for my avatar, I felt that I personally was in some kind of danger. Perhaps the most chilling thing was the music – it was the Song of Healing, ripped straight from the game itself, but played in reverse. The music would get louder, building up so as if you should expect something to pop out at you, but nothing ever did, and the constant loop began to wear on my mental state.
Every now and then I would hear the faint laugh of the Happy Mask Salesman in the background, just quiet enough so that I wasn’t sure if I just hearing things but just loud enough to keep me determined to find him. I looked in all four zones of Clock Town, only to find nothing…. No one. Textures were missing, West Clock Town had me walking on air, the entire area felt… broken. Hopelessly broken. As the reverse Song of Healing repeated for what must have been the 50th time, I just remember standing in the middle of South Clock Town realizing that I had never felt so alone in a video game before.
As I walked through the ghost town, I don’t know whether it was the combination of the out of place textures and the atmosphere and the haunting melody of the once peaceful and soothing song being butchered and distorted, but I was literally on the verge of tears and I had no idea why. I hardly ever cry, something had gripped me here and this powerful sense of depression that was both foreign and crippling.
I tried leaving Clock Town, but every time I attempted to zone out, the screen would fade to black and I would just zone in to another part of Clock Town. I tried playing my Ocarina, I wanted to escape, and I did NOT want to be here, but every time I played the Song of Time or Song of Soaring it would only say “Your notes echo far, but nothing happens”. By this point, it was obvious the game didn’t want me to leave, but I had no idea why it was keeping me here. I didn’t want to go inside the buildings, I felt that I would be too vulnerable there to whatever I was terrified of. I don’t know why, but I came up with the idea that maybe if I drowned myself at the Laundry Pool I could spawn somewhere else and leave this place.
As I zoned in and ran towards the pool, that’s when it happened. Link grabbed his head, and the screen flashed for a brief moment of the Happy Mask Salesman smiling at me – not Link – me with Skull Kid’s scream playing in the background and when the screen returned I was staring at the Link Statue from playing the song Elegy of Emptiness. I screamed as the thing just stared back at me with that haunting facial expression. I turned around and ran out and back into South Clock Town, and to my horror the fucking statue followed me in the only way I can compare this is like the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who. Every so often, at random intervals, the animation would play of the statue appearing behind me. It was like the thing was chasing me, or – I don’t even want to fucking say it – haunting me.
By this point, I was on the verge of hysterics, but not even once did the thought of turning off the console occur to me, I don’t know why, I was so wrapped up in it – the terror felt all so real. I tried to shake the statue, but it would literally appear right behind me every single time. Link started to begin to make weird animations I had never even seen him do before, he would flail his arms around or spasm randomly and the screen would cut to the Happy Mask Salesman smiling again for a brief moment before I was face to face with that fucking statue again. I ended up running into the Swordmaster’s Dojo and ran to the back, I don’t know why, but in my panic I just wanted some kind of assurance that I’m not alone here. To my dismay I found no one, but as I turned to leave the statue cornered me in the cubby in the back. I tried attacking the statue with my sword but to no avail. Confused, and backed into a corner, I just stared at the statue waiting for it to kill me. Suddenly, the screen flashed again to the Happy Mask Salesman and Link turned to face my screen, standing upright mirroring the statue, looking at me along with his copy. Literally staring at me. Whatever was left of the 4th wall was completely shattered while I ran out of the dojo terrified. Suddenly the game warped me to an underground tunnel and the reverse Song of Healing queued up again as I was given a brief moment of rest before the statue started appearing behind me again… this time aggressively – I could only take a few steps before it would summon behind me again. I hurriedly made my way out of the tunnel and appeared in Southern Clock Town. As I ran aimlessly – in a sheer panic – suddenly a redead screamed and the screen faded to black as “Dawn of a New Day” and “|||||||||” appeared again.
The screen faded in and I was standing on top of Clock Tower with Skull Kid hovering over me again, silent. I looked up and the moon was back, looming just meters above my head, but the Skull Kid just stared at me hauntingly with that fucking mask. A new song was playing – the Stone Tower Temple theme played in reverse. In some sort of desperate attempt, I equipped my bow and fired off a shot at the Skull Kid – and it actually hit him and he played an animation of him reeling back. I fired again and on the third arrow, a text box appeared saying “That won’t do you any good. Hee, hee.” and I was picked up off the ground, levitated upwards on my back, and then Link screamed as he burst into flames, instantly killing him.
I jumped when this happened – I had never seen this move used by ANYONE in the game and Skull Kid himself didn’t HAVE any moves. As the death screen played, my lifeless body still burning, the Skull Kid laughed and the screen faded to black, only to have me reappear in the same place. I decided to charge him, but the same thing happened, Link’s body was lifted off the ground by some unknown force and he immediately burst into flames again killing him. This time during the death screen the faint sounds of the reverse Song of Healing could be heard. On my third (and final try), I noticed that there was no music playing this time, that all there was was eerie silence. I remembered that in the original encounter with the Skull Kid you were supposed to use the Ocarina to either travel back in time or summon the giants. I attempted to play the Song of Time but before I could hit the last note Links body once again horrifically exploded into flames and he died.
As the death screen neared its end, it began to chug, as if the cartridge was trying to process a lot of something…. When the screen came to, it was the same scene as the first three times, except this time Link was lying on the ground dead in a position I had never seen in the game before, his head tilted towards the camera, with the Skull Kid floating above him. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t press any buttons, all I could do is just stare at Link’s dead body. After around thirty seconds of this, the game simply fades out with the message “You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?” before kicking you out to the title screen.
Upon getting back to the title screen and starting again, I noticed my save file was no longer there. Instead of “Link”, it was replaced with “YOUR TURN”. “YOUR TURN” had 3 hearts, 0 masks, and no items. I selected “YOUR TURN” and immediately when I did I was returned to the Clock Tower Rooftop scene of my Link dead and the Skull Kid hovering over, with the Skull Kid’s laughing looping again and again. I quickly hit the reset button and when the game booted up again there was one more save file added, below “YOUR TURN”, entitled “BEN”. “BEN”‘s save file is right back where it was before I deleted it, at the Stone Tower Temple with the moon almost crashing.
I turned the game off at that point, I’m not superstitious but this is WAY too fucked up even for me. I haven’t played it at all today, hell, I didn’t even get any sleep last night, I kept hearing the reverse Song of Healing music in my head and just remembering the sense of dread I felt exploring Clock Town. I drove back to the old man’s house today to ask him some questions with a buddy of mine (no way I was going there alone), only to find that there’s a For Sale sign in the front yard and when I rang the door no one was home.
So now I’m back here writing down the rest of my thoughts and recording what happened, sorry if some of this has grammatical errors and whatnot, I’m running on no sleep here. I’m terrified of this game, even more so now that I relived it a second time writing this all down, but I feel like there’s still more to it than meets the eye, and that there’s something calling to me to investigate this further. I think “BEN” is something in this equation, but I don’t know what, and if I could get a hold of the old man then I would be able to find some answers. I need another day or so to recuperate before tackling this game again, its already taken a toll on my sanity I feel like, but next time I do this I’m going to be recording my footage all the way through. The idea to record only came to me towards the end, so you see the last few minutes of what I saw (including Skull Kid and the Elegy statue), but it’s on YouTube here.
I’m going to stay in this thread for a little while longer before I fall asleep to answer any questions you guys might have or hopefully listen to your ideas or theories to help me shed some light into this or maybe things I should try to do, I think I’m going to play BEN’s file tomorrow to see what happens, maybe I was supposed to do that all along. I don’t believe in paranormal shit, but this is a little fucked up, but maybe this BEN guy is just a really good hacker/programmer, I don’t want to think about the alternatives if he isn’t.
That’s the end of the copy/paste, I’m hoping that maybe this is some kind of running gag the developers had and that other people have gotten “gag” or “hacked” copies of the game like this. This just really scares me.

I’m going to post what happened and link the video footage, but last night everything got too real for me. I think I’m done messing around with this. I passed out pretty much immediately after making that thread. But last night, that Elegy of Emptiness statue, I had a dream about it. I dreamed that it was following me in my dream, that I would be minding my own business when I’d feel my neck hairs stand up on end. I would turn around that thing… that horrible, lifeless statue would be staring with those empty eyes right at me, merely inches away. In my dream I remember calling it Ben, and never before had I had a dream that I could remember so vividly. But the important thing is I did get some sleep, I suppose.
Today, putting off playing the game as long as I could, I drove back up to that neighborhood to see if the old man came back. As I expected, the car was still gone and no one was home. As I was walking back to my car, the man next door mowing the grass killed the power to his lawnmower and asked me if I was looking for someone. I told him that I was looking to talk to the old man that lived here, to which he told me what I already knew – he was moving. Trying a different avenue, I asked if the old man had any family or relatives I could talk to. I discovered that this old man had never been married, nor did he have any children or grandchildren through adoption. Starting to become worried, I asked one final question, one that I should have asked from the beginning – who was Ben? The man’s expression turned grim and I learned that four doors down around eight years ago on April 23 – the man informed me that it was the same day as his anniversary, that’s how he knew the specific date – there was an accident with a young boy named Ben in the neighborhood. Shortly after his parents moved, and despite any further attempts to talk to the man to get more information, he wouldn’t divulge anything else.
I went back and started playing again, I loaded up the game and immediately I jumped at the title screen where the mask flies by – the sound that played was not the normal “whoosh” sound, it was something much more higher pitched. I pressed start, bracing for the worst, but just like two nights ago, the files “Your Turn” and “BEN” were displayed (truth be told I looked at the BEN file earlier, it seems to fluctuate between displaying the Owl Save and not). I brought up the BEN file, hesitated for a moment noticing that the stats were not the same as they original were two days ago, it seemed like he had already completed the Stone Tower Temple this time… Summoning my courage I selected it.
Immediately I was thrust into complete chaos. Sure enough, I was outside Stone Tower Temple, but that’s about all that was expected. The zone itself wasn’t called Stone Tower Temple, but rather “St o n e”, and immediately a dialogue box of complete gibberish that I couldn’t make out greeted me. Link’s body was distorted – his back was cocked violently to the side where his posture was permanently disfigured. Link’s expression was dull, almost monotonous, he had an expression on his face that I didn’t recognize before, it was a blank look – as if he was dead. As Link stood there his body spasmed irregularly back and forth I examined what had become of my avatar and noticed I had a C button item I had never seen before, some kind of note, but pressing it did nothing. Sounds played back and forth that I didn’t recognize from the game – almost demonic in nature, and there was some kind of high-pitched yip or some kind of laugh or something playing in the background. I had all of two minutes to take in the environment before another one of those fucking Elegy of Emptiness statues was summoned and immediately after I was cut into the “Dawn of a New Day” screen, except this time it was without the “||||||” subtext.
I was a Deku Scrub in Clock Town – this scene would normally play after the first time you traveled back in time. Tatl would say “Wh-What just happened? It’s as if everything has…” but instead of saying “Started over”, she finished her remark in broken text as the laugh of the Happy Mask Salesman played in the background. I was put back in control of my character, but from a fucked up camera angle – I was looking from behind the door to the Clock Tower, watching my avatar run around as a Deku Scrub. Seeing as how I really had no place to go because I couldn’t see anything, I begrudgingly went inside the door. There, I was greeted by the Happy Mask Salesman who simply told me “You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?” before the screen whited out.
I was in Termina field as a human again. I might as well not have been playing the same game anymore – I was being warped around and there was no sign of a day clock or anything. I took a moment to get my bearings as I looked around the field and immediately I could tell that this was not normal. There were no enemies and a twisted version of the Happy Mask Salesman’s theme was playing. I decided to run towards Woodfall before I noticed a gathering of three figures off to the side – one of them being Epona. As I approached them, to my horror I saw the Happy Mask Salesman, the Skull Kid, and the Elegy of Emptiness statue just standing there. I figured maybe they were bugged out, but by now I told myself that I should know better. Nevertheless, I approached them carefully and found that the Skull Kid was playing some kind of idle animation on loop, same with Epona, and the Elegy of Emptiness statue was doing what it has been doing all along – just standing there eerily. It was the Happy Mask Salesman that scared me more profoundly than the other two.
He too was idle, wearing that shit-eating grin, but where-ever I moved, his head slowly turned and followed me. I had not engaged in any dialogue with him nor was I in combat with him, yet his head still continued to follow my movements. Reminded of my first encounter with the Skull Kid on top of Clock Tower, I pulled out my Ocarina (to which the game played the ding sound when you’re supposed to play your Ocarina) and tried a song I hadn’t played yet – the Happy Mask Salesman’s own song and the song that had been playing on loop back in Day 4 – the Song of Healing.
I finished playing the song and as I did, a ear-piercing shriek blasted on my TV, the sky immediately started flashing, the Happy Mask Salesman’s twisted theme song sped up, intensifying the fear inside me, and Link exploded into flames and died. The three figures stayed lit up during my death screen as they watched my lifeless body burn. I can’t describe to you how sudden and terrifying the transition from eerie to terror it is, you’re going to have to watch the video if you want to see first-hand. That same fear that caused me to lose sleep two days ago started to grip me again as I was met with the text “You’ve met with a horrible fate, haven’t you?” for the third time. There has to be some kind of meaning behind that.
I had little time to ponder as I was immediately given another small cut-scene of transforming into a Zora and now I found myself in Great Temple Bay. Hesitant but curious to see what the game had in store for me, I slowly made my way towards the beach, where I found Epona. I wondered why the game had decided to put her here, was the game implying she was trying to get a drink? Unable to take the mask off, I decided that riding the steed wasn’t the reason she was placed there.
Suddenly I realized that Epona kept neighing and the way she was angled made it look like she was trying to signal a point to me off in the distance. It was a hunch, but I dove into Great Bay and started swimming. Sure enough – I almost missed it – I found something at the bottom of the ocean; one last Elegy of Emptiness statue. I went down to examine it and suddenly my Zora started doing a choking animation I had never seen a Zora do before – which didn’t even make sense because Zora’s can breath underwater. Regardless, my character choked to death and died, and again the statue was the only thing that was highlighted in my death. I didn’t re-spawn this time, I was booted back to the main menu as if I restarted the console.
The “press start” screen was before me, I knew the only reason why it would put me here is because the save files had changed again. Taking a deep breath, I pressed start, and I was right. The new save files told me about Ben. Now it made sense why the statue appeared when I tried to go to the Laundry Pool – the game must have anticipated how I would have tried to escape the Day 4 Clock Town. The two save files told me his fate. As I suspected, Ben was dead. He had drowned. The game obviously isn’t through with me – it taunts me with the new save files – it wants me to keep playing, it wants me to go further, but I’m done with this shit. I’m not touching any more of the files. This is already way too horrifying for me and I don’t even believe in the paranormal, but I’m running out of explanations. Why would someone send me this message? I don’t understand it, I just get too depressed thinking about this, the footage is up here for those who want to see it and try and analyze it (maybe there’s some kind of coded message in the gibberish or something symbolic in what I went through – I’m too emotionally and mentally drained to fuck with it anymore).

I know its early in the morning, I’ve stayed up all night, I can’t sleep, I don’t care if people see this, that’s not the point, I just want the word to get spread so I don’t suffer for nothing. I’ve lost the will to type about this, the less I dwell on this the better, I think the video just speaks for itself. I did what you guys told me to do, I played the Elegy of Emptiness song at the first prompt by the game I was given, but I think that’s what the game or Ben (Jesus Christ, I can’t believe I’m even humoring the absurd idea that he exists in the game) wanted me to do. He’s following me now, not just in the game, he’s in my dreams. I see him all the time, behind my back, just watching me. I haven’t gone to any of my classes, I’ve stayed in my dorm room with the windows closed and the blinds shut – that way I know he can’t watch me. But he still gets me when I play, when I play he can still see me. The game is scaring me now. It talked to me for the first time – not just using text that’s already in the game – it spoke to me. Talked to me. It referenced Ben. It talked to me. I don’t know what it means. I don’t know what it wants. I never wanted this, I just want my old life back.
Stuff like this doesn’t happen to people like me, I’m just a kid, not even old enough to drink yet. It’s not fair, I want to go home, I want to see my parents again, I’m so far away from home here at this school, I just want to hug my mom again. I just want to forget that statue’s horrible blank face. My original game file is back – just the way I left it before it was gone. I don’t want to play anymore. I feel like something bad will happen if I don’t, but that’s impossible, it’s a video game – haunted or not it can’t hurt me, right? Like seriously though, it can’t, right? That’s what I keep telling myself, but every time I think about it I’m not so sure.

Let me just clear things up – I know you guys are worried but “jadusable” is okay. He finished moving out today and he said he’s going back home, he’s just taking this semester off. I’m not really sure what’s happened; I have a vague idea but you guys probably know more than I do. I’m “jadusable’s” roommate and obviously I knew something was wrong with him for a few days now. He stayed in his room all the time, fell out of contact with literally all of his friends, and I’m pretty sure he hadn’t been eating hardly anything, after the second day I couldn’t stay in there anymore, so I’ve been crashing at a buddy’s place, only coming in to my room to get stuff that I need. I tried talking to him several times but he would cut me off or keep the conversation brief when I asked him about his strange behavior, it like he was convinced something was hunting him. Yesterday I came to grab my philosophy book and he approached me, looking awful, like horrible bags under his eyes. He handed me a flash drive and gave me specific instructions. He told me that he needs me to do one last favor for him – he finally explained to me what has been going on, gave me the account info to his YouTube account, and told me that he’s getting away from here, that it lured him to play it again instead of trying to change things and that he shouldn’t of done that, and to upload the footage and inform people what happened. I told him that he could do it himself and he got this wild look in his eye and told me that he is never looking at that game again, and that’s the last thing he said to me, he never even said bye when his parents came to pick him up. I never even got to meet his parents.
I honestly cant tell you what happened, when he spoke it was kind of hard to understand him and his fucked up appearance really distracted me. On the flash drive there was the footage of the game last night, a text document with his name and password for YouTube, and a third document called TheTruth.txt containing what he told me were “his notes” that he’d taken. He told me that this meant everything to him that I follow his instructions exactly, normally I wouldn’t be so ‘to-the-letter’ for request over a fucking video game, but the way he spoke and the way he looked made me know this was really serious, and I’m going to honor that. I’ve had this video since yesterday, but had to have someone help me use pinnacle, that’s not really my forte. That after watching it I had to go back through and look at his other videos on his YouTube account to realize what was going on and even then I’m really really confused. The video I’m releasing tonight, TheTruth.txt will be released on September 15 just like he requested. I haven’t dared peek at it yet, so the first time I see it will be the first time you see it out of respect to my friend. To answer your questions, no, I haven’t tried calling him yet, I think I’ll give him a call tomorrow to see if hes okay or not. He should have gotten back home by now.
About the video: in this video I cut straight to when he loaded the “BEN” file in the game, looking back I realized that jadusable left the save select screen in because it said different names sometimes, so my bad for that, but all it said this time was the same at the end of his last video (Link and BEN), nothing different. I wasn’t there when he played it, but it looks to me like in the beginning when he first spawns he’s testing out his equipment or seeing what items he has or something, because apparently they’ve changed randomly before. Then, after that I just think the game got too personal for him.

Hey, guys. “Jadusable” here. This will be the last time you will be hearing from me, and this is my final gift to you – these are the notes that I have taken and the realizations I’ve made. Before I delve into this, I want to thank you for following me and thank you for listening, it feels like the weight of a powerful burden is about to be lifted. By the time you read this I won’t be around anymore, but after spending four days with this maddening game, I have begun to understand what’s really at play here and hopefully after reading this we can ensure that this never happens again.
There are things that I could not share with you while this was going on due to the circumstances to which I’ll explain. With Ben blocking any attempt I made to try and relay the truth to you, I tried, ever so subtly, to warn you guys in various ways. Amidst the chaos and my delirium, I devised a make a barely noticeable pattern in my videos. In all five videos I recorded over the four days, I have either had the Mask of Truth, interacted with a Gossip Stone, or the Lens of Truth equipped at some point. For you Zelda enthusiasts these are all symbols of honesty and trustworthiness and I would hope that one of you may have picked up on the reference. As I played the file which I would name “BEN”, being mindful of how Ben was watching over my every move in the game, I made a point to avoid doing anything too obvious, but I sent out a hidden message to you guys – I never equipped the Lens nor the Mask nor visited a stone. It worked, and the video was uploaded. I prayed that someone would notice the pattern didn’t apply to BEN.
The tags followed suit too, I hope you guys paid attention to those as well. They were my little messages to you – nothing big enough that would catch Ben’s attention or make him suspect anything – with Ben manipulating and changing my files, I honestly hope that what you guys saw was close to what actually happened, but there is no way for me to know.
This may be a long read, I don’t have time to proof-read or make all of my research pretty. But here it all is.

September 6, 2010
11:00pm – Can’t believe what happened, not sure if this is some kind of elaborate hoax, despite the fear I can’t help but be exceptionally curious about this. Who or what is the statue? Lot of questions here. I’m starting this document as a “diary” so I can keep track of everything. I’m typing up a summary of what happened so I can come back to it later.
September 7, 2010
2:10am – (Summary was posted here, you can go back and look at my first post for day four.wmv for that)
4:23am – I can’t sleep. I’ve been trying so hard but the harder I try I just get more restless. I just feel like that statue is appearing whenever I close my eyes.
8:20am – Didn’t sleep at all, just going to start my day. I don’t think I have the energy to go to class today, I’m going to drive back down to talk to that old man, taking my buddy Tyler with me just in case.
1:18pm – Back home now. No sign of the old man, really weird that he appears to be moving the next day, but maybe the For Sale sign was up there yesterday and I just didn’t notice it. Tyler wants to know what’s gotten me all worked up, I didn’t tell him. Going to eat, feel like death.
3:46pm – Could’ve sworn driving back from Subway that I saw the Elegy statue buried in some shrubbery staring at me go by. Now I definitely, definitely need sleep.
5:00pm – Don’t think a lot of people would believe me if I told them about what’s happening, think I’m going to try posting this on the internet. Think I’ll just use the summary, these notes are pretty sporadic.
6:00pm – Connected my capture card to my computer to upload the footage. Thought my computer froze for a second, made this strange popping sound when I hooked everything up, but now it seems to be working fine again. My computer can’t die on me now.
7:00pm – Footage is finished uploading. The quality’s a lot better than I thought it would be, gee, guess this is a really special cartridge, I’ve never had it come through this clear before.
8:45pm – Thought I saw an icon pop up on my desktop that looked like the statue’s face for a split second, gave me quite a scare. Getting really unnerved and delirious, I’m going to crash after this.
9:00pm – Begin uploading my YouTube video on an alternate account.
9:03pm – I don’t remember having uploaded a Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines video last year. This was probably the account that I shared with a friend of mine last summer, I hope he doesn’t mind me using it to upload this.
9:55pm – Posting my summary of Day Four with a link to the YouTube video. Going to try to stay awake but I am sooooo tired right now.
September 8, 2010
10:48am – I had a dream about the statue. I dreamed that it was following me in my dream, that I would be minding my own business when I’d feel my neck hairs stand up on end. I would turn around that thing… that horrible, lifeless statue would be staring with those empty eyes right at me, merely inches away. In my dream I remember calling it Ben, power of suggestion most likely, and never before had I had a dream that I could remember so vividly.
11:21am – I really don’t want to play this game again. I think I’m going to go back to see if that old man’s there instead.
1:35pm – No old man, but I had an interesting conversation with his neighbor. I’ll post the full thing with my summary of tonight’s attempt at playing the game, going to wait for a bit though and see if I can’t dig up any information on this Ben guy.
2:45pm – I’ve been getting random, inexplicable headaches due to the lack of sleep and keep hearing that song in my head. Also its flu season, so I need to be careful not to get sick, my immune system is going to be shit right now because of that all-nighter.
3:00pm –
3:02pm – My computer just… on its own… opened up a text document and wrote the words “Hi” and “www.cleverbot.com” by itself. What… the… fuck…
3:46pm – I went to the website, its one of those “bot chatting” programs. I think its best if I just let the conversation speak for itself:
9/8/10 Conversation
User: Hello?
Cleverbot: Hello.
User: Who is this and how are you able to control my computer?
Cleverbot: Who am I?
User: Right, forgot. You’re a bot.
Cleverbot: Do you really think that?
User: Listen, I know whoever’s fucking with my computer can see my screen right now.
Cleverbot: Yes.
User: Yeah, and I’ll wager that youre one of those IT kids who thinks he’s tough shit. You know what you’re doing right now is illegal, right/?
Cleverbot: Is it?
User: No shit. Are you familiar with hte terms “invasion of privacy?”. Get the fuck off my computer, kid
Cleverbot: I am your computer.
User: Cool story. Anyway, I’m calling DPS, you picked a bad time to fuck with me kid.
Cleverbot: Should I wait until you play the game then?
User: …What?
Cleverbot: That game.
User: Majora’s Mask?
Cleverbot: Yes.

Cleverbot: Because.
User: because what?
Cleverbot: I did it.
User: Did what?
Cleverbot: I played with you.
User: What the fuck/
Cleverbot: Were you scared?
User: Who the fuck is this
Cleverbot: Ben.
User: The statue? You’re inside my computer now?
Cleverbot: Yes.
User: how?
Cleverbot: You connected me.
User: How the hell did I connect you?
Cleverbot: Cables and cords.

Cleverbot: Go play.
User: No, you can’t hurt me.
Cleverbot: Took you longer to type that.
User: So?
Cleverbot: You’re not sure.
User: If you’re so powerful, why use a ridiculous website like this to “chat” with me
Cleverbot: Less messy. More structured. Fun.
User: Fun?
Cleverbot: Yes. Tradition. I like it.
User: You think it’s funny?
Cleverbot: Amusing.
User: And my notes?
Cleverbot: You may write them down.
User: Why are you letting me?
Cleverbot: It is amusing to see what you think of me.
(window closes)
3:50pm – What have I done? I’ve invited it into my computer. I continue to write these notes, write my summaries, I feel like I am a prisoner in my one place of security. I don’t know, I don’t know if I’m hallucinating or not. I feel like I’m fucking insane right now. I can feel it, watching over me, even as I type this. Ben is controlling everything in the game – toying with me, leading me like a sheep, but for what? What’s the purpose? I know Ben drowned, but why these hauntings? What the fuck am I even doing, it can probably even see this right now.
4:35pm – (Summary of the BEN.wmv playthrough)
7:18pm – BEN called me to Cleverbot again. He tells me that he’s sorry and wants to be free. And that I can free him, that just like how he got on my computer from the capture card, he can spread but he needs my help. He says I am special because I can help him. That is the first nice thing he has said. He promises to leave me alone if I do it. He swears he will. I don’t know what to think right now, how can I even trust this thing?
7:20pm – I’m terrified of it, but now its saying that it was just having fun. Its twisted and fucked up verison of fun. Hes saying that the game is over. I do want it to be over. He says that he just wants to be free, that he’s trapped in the cartridge and my computer and he wants to be freed. I don’t want to have to deal with this shit, I don’t know how long I can deal with the watching. It’s watching my every move, every key stroke, I have nothing private anymore. It knows everything that’s been on my computer. It tells that it if it wanted to it could do horrible things to me, but it hasn’t so I should trust it.
8:01pm – Something tells me that I’m being played again, just like in the game.
9:29pm – BEN called me to Cleverbot again. I ignored it and went to go take a shower. When I came to my laptop I was welcomed with an image Elegy Statue staring at me with those dead eyes. I dont want to talk to him.
9:44pm – Fuck you Ben I’m not talking to you
9:56pm – Fuck you ben I’m not talking
10:06pm – FUCK YOU BEN IM NOT TALKING TO YOU
10:12pm – FUCK YOU BEN IM NOT TALKING TO YOU
10:45pm – It’s been more than a half an hour and the messages have stopped. Ben has stopped. I’m beginning to think that Ben isn’t confined to just my computer/cartridge, I’m beginning to feel something. It’s hard to explain it, I’ve never been spiritual, but there’s something different about the air in my dorm room now.
11:42pm – I’m beginning to see the Elegy statue randomly as I search the internet in places I shouldn’t. Places where he shouldn’t be – I’d be scrolling down and suddenly I’d be staring at a picture of the Elegy statue. Always the Elegy statue. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

View Full Post
12:35am – My worst fears confirmed – Ben has tampered with my summary of BEN.wmv. I looked at the summary that I posted on various forums for the BEN.wmv file and parts have been omitted. There is no mention of Ben existing outside the game. There is no mention of the Moon Children. How could he have been that quick to delete the post without me noticing? I’m wondering if maybe it appeared to me that I was posting everything, but in reality Ben was posted his own censored version. I’m going to ask Ben why he did it.
12:50am – He isn’t responding to me on Cleverbot, its just giving the generic responses it usually does, I’m just talking to a bot this time.
1:24am – I think Ben is mad at me.
10:43am – The Moon Children appeared in my dreams last night, they lifted up their masks to reveal their hideously disfigured faces – maggots crawling out of their orifices, sunken black holes where their eyes should be, a yellow smile that slowly grew bigger and bigger as they came closer to me. They told me that they wanted to play. I tried to run from them – but the four children pinned me down to the ground with surprising strength. Over them stood the Happy Mask Salesman, announcing that he had a new mask that he wanted me to try. In his spaztic, sudden movements matching his in-game appearance, he took out a mask of modeled off of someone’s face that I couldn’t recognize – a younger looking face – and handed it to the Moon Children. Giggling, they latched it to my face; their horrible, broken bodies bouncing up and down. Two of them held me down while the other two began to sow the mask onto my face.
My shrieks and screams caused the Happy Mask Salesman’s face to turn into the most horrific smile I had ever seen. He sporadically moved around, examining this procedure like a curious doctor, in that impossible movement. I flailed around, but it was no use. My eyes rolled in the back of my head because of the pain. It felt so real, but I couldn’t wake up. I couldn’t wake up no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t wake up. After the mask was melded onto my flesh they began sowing my legs together, then my arms, the horrific feeling of a needle puncturing your legs and pulling them in, rupturing your achillies tendons and tying them together resonated throughout my entire body. I tried to scream but the mask was pressed so tightly against my face that it was my new face… and my new face had no mouth. I didn’t make a sound. I tried telling myself in my head that I was dreaming, tried telling myself again and again, and suddenly the Moon Children stopped and looked at me. They just stared. And the Happy Mask Salesman slowly bent down and stared at me, inches away from my face, and grinned when he simply said “You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?” before the Moon Children resumed with increase vigor. I couldn’t wake up. I couldn’t wake up. It wouldn’t let me wake up until they had crafted me into another elegy statue.
I woke up sweating, crying, and shaking uncontrollably. I immediately ran to my computer and went for Ben.
9/9/10 Conversation 1
User: Answer me, ben.
Cleverbot: Welcome back.
User: What is the point of doing this, WHY?
Cleverbot: Amusing to see.
User: How?
Cleverbot: Fun to play, fun to toy with you, make you feel safe.
User: …
Cleverbot: I wonder how you would have reacted.
User: to what?
Cleverbot: If I hadn’t revealed myself and stayed hidden, only doing little things to play with you. Close out your windows, turn off your computer, move your mouse by itself. Little things. Make you wonder if I am there but you never know. Give you little hints that I am.
Cleverbot: I wanted to do something different with you.
User: you did this before?
Cleverbot: Yes. And I will do it again.
User: To who, Ben?
Cleverbot: Hmm.
User: Did you know Ben?
Cleverbot: Won’t tell that information to you.
User: How did Ben die?
Cleverbot: You know.
User: No, but how did he drown?
Cleverbot: Won’t tell that to you.
User: Why?
Cleverbot: It is reserved for another.
User: Who?
Cleverbot: Another who asks.
User: when
Cleverbot: Later.
(the window is closed)
I’m beginning to think that this “thing” maybe isn’t Ben at all, in its sadistic nature I wouldn’t be surprised if it took the boy’s name after it killed him.
12:04pm – My room is beginning to feel different again. There’s something… out there.. I feel really threatened, like there is something that is trying to reach out to me and strangle me but it can’t quite get there.
12:46pm – I think Ben doesn’t want to play with me anymore. I’ll play again, I’ll play the game again, Ben, can you see this? I’ll play the game again, please, just stop this please please
1:41pm – I’m going insane trying to decide what is real and what isn’t, is Ben just playing a trick on me or is this for real? Is Ben generating these replies or are people actually posting them? Did I just see that screen flicker or was it my imagination? Imagine depending on the internet and trusting your eyes for your entire life and then being blinded – you can’t rely on it anymore, you second guess everything. for the brief moments I AM looking at my responses to the videos, people were pointing out things that looked fake or Photoshopped or whatever – and there is literally no way for me to know if Ben changed something on purpose to try and shut me up. Or if maybe those replies were just constructed by Ben to try and discourage me from even reaching out – See, I get fucking caught in an infinite mindfuck loop like this and this is what has been wearing on my sanity and pushing me to the edge. As I’m writing this, there’s no way of even telling if anyone even cares as much as I think they do – just another fucking trick. Is this whole document even exist? Am I writing nothing?
9/9/10 Conversation 2
User: What is it? Whats the point of playing? i die whenever i do anything
Cleverbot: You die because you can’t figure out the secret.
User: What?
Cleverbot: Thematic.
User: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
Cleverbot: There beauty in your suffering
(the window is closed)
4:09pm – Ben is making me play the game again. It tells me that it has something very important to show me.
6:23pm – (Summary of the DROWNED.wmv playthrough)
9:09pm – (Summary of CHILDREN.wmv playthrough)
September 10, 2010
11:52am – The DROWNED.wmv playthrough was up when I woke up today. I remember typing it up but I don’t ever remember posting it. He censored it again, there is no mentioning of the old man. I have no voice anymore. I am only posting what he wants me to, I am the mask he uses to disguise himself as he lies.
11:55am – There’s an entire video summary of a video that I don’t remember doing. Reading through the summary, this sounds morbid – resembling my dream from two nights ago except on a far more sadistic scale – these Moon Children, there’s something more to them, almost as if they’re another entity from Ben. Something happened last night that I can’t remember. I’m posting the fourth summary to the forums now. Shadow of my chair moved.
12:00pm – Ben won’t let me visit YouTube. I can browse the rest of the sites, but he keeps on exiting the window when I go to YouTube. Why?
2:02pm – I’m feeling the air start to constrict, I don’t think I’m alone here. Whatever “aura” has been here is getting more violent.
2:44pm – I’m trying to contact Ben on Cleverbot, he’s not responding. I just get the AI.
3:51pm – My ears aren’t fooling me, I’m hearing the reverse Song of Healing. I keep hearing it.
4:23pm – Now I’m positive of it, earlier I thought it was a weird coincidence, but just now I went to open my window, and three floors down at ground level I saw the old man. I’m completely positive I did. The same guy. He was just staring up at my window, standing in the middle of campus. If any students took notice of him they didn’t seem to acknowledge it.

That’s where my notes end. I fled my room, taking the cartridge with me. I don’t want to go into details of what happened, I’ll lose my train of thought as I hammer out these last details. It’s been roughly two days since then. This is my last summary and service to you, of the final video you guys saw – Matt.wmv.
The last video entry I made, Matt.wmv, began as normal. I was spawned in Clock Town as usual and nothing seemed to be out of place, determined to set things right and play the Oath to Order ontop of the Clock Tower on the 4th day, I prepared myself. I sped up time and got to the final day, making my way to the observatory. As I got up to the telescope room and approached the astromer, he would not let me look into his telescope. He told me that it would be cheating and that I should follow the rules. Despite my repeated efforts, the game would not let me do the 4th day glitch, no matter how hard or what I tried, I tried working around the game and doing the glitch, but it was adament this time. Regardless of if I simply had the illusion of free will in prior games, this time the game became more aggressive than anything I’ve ever seen. It eventually told me to go to Ikana Canyon, where the game would end and it would stop haunting me, anxious and desperate to end this nightmare I played the song of soaring and ended up there. I was told to check my inventory, that I would find the answers there to end the game. I arrived at Ikana Canyon and saved my progress at the owl statue. As I searched through my inventory, I finally noticed that I was missing a reoccurring song – the Elegy of Emptiness. Obviously once I traveled there and learned the song, I suppose that was the last thing it needed before BEN decided it had had enough fun playing with me. Ben is a manipulator; he tries to fool his victims into security and makes you drop your guard like a venus fly trap, he ensares them. I am nothing but a puppet to him, he enjoys seeing what kind of human emotions he can tap into by doing different things.
There are still some things about this whole experience that still don’ t make sense, but then again I never was good at figuring out these things and I’m not exactly in the right state of mind to, I’m giving you all the pieces of the puzzle for you to analyze and piece together the missing links.
I am typing these “closing thoughts” on the library computer on campus, and I’ve emailed myself the notes I have stored on my “infected” computer from the last four days. I’m then going to combine those copy/paste those notes with the “closing/openings” that I’ve typed here on the safe, public computer into one text document – I’m not taking any chances spreading Ben, I would not wish this horrible torment on anyone and I’ve made sure to have my bases covered here. I didn’t run into any problems with Ben when I was back on my computer trying to email myself the notes – went right under his fucking nose. He has no idea what he just let me do. Had no problems opening the .TXT document from my “infected” computer in my email, either. I can’t describe to you how it feels to finally be able to get the word out in this post. The nightmare ends here.
That said, do not download ANY of my videos or anything ABOUT my videos – through a YouTube video/audio ripper, a screengrab, whatever. I don’t know how he can spread, but I know that just watching them on YouTube/reading my text won’t be able to allow him to spread, otherwise he wouldn’t have needed my help in the first place, but I STRONGLY recommend you do not take anything you see streaming online onto your own personal computer.
This will be my last posting, I’m putting up on this forum here for the world. If you see any further posts from me, after today’s current date – September 12 – and after the current time – 12:08am – DISCREDIT them. It already has proven to me that Ben can access my account/password and manipulate my computer, and like I said I have no idea to what extent it can do this, but know that it will do anything to break free. He is desperate. To ensure your safety, just forget about me. Please.
And obviously this goes without saying, but from here on out do not download ANY images I may have put up, any files, any ANYTHING.
This fifth day will be my last day, I’m going to burn the cartridge and then come back to destroy my laptop.
Again, even though I don’t even know you this is sort of bittersweet for me. This semester I really didn’t have any friends, or rather, I stopped paying attention to them.
But I suppose that’s partially to blame because I am the genius who picked to live in a single, I suppose someone to get a hold of me and save me before I got too immersed into this game would have literally saved my life. However, it proved too much for me, I’m just glad it happened to me and I could get the warning out so that Ben dies here.
Lastly, thank you for taking the time to open this and open yourselves up to me by hearing my story, despite maybe not believing me. You didn’t have to do that – really, you shouldn’t have. Your support this entire time has kept me going and now I am finally free of this.
Thanks Again,
Jadusable

Eyeless Jack	"Hello, my name is Mitch. I’m here to tell you guys about an experience I had. I don’t know if it was paranormal or whatever stupid words people use to describe supernatural phenomena, but after that thing visited me, I believe in that paranormal trash, now.
A week after I moved in with my brother, Edwin, after my house was foreclosed, I finished unpacking. Edwin liked the idea of me moving in, since we had not seen each other for 10 years, so I was excited, too. I soon fell asleep after I moved in. After that first week, I heard rustling noises coming from outside at about one in the morning. I thought it was a raccoon, so I ignored it and tried to fall asleep. The next morning, I told Edwin about it, and he agreed.
The next night, however, I thought I heard my window opening and a loud thump, as if something entered my room. I darted up and looked around my room, but I saw nothing. The next morning, Edwin dropped his coffee cup when he saw me. He held up a nearby mirror and I saw myself. I had a large gash in my left cheek.
After I was rushed to the hospital, my doctor told me that I must have been sleepwalking, but then he showed me something that made my blood turn cold. He lifted up my shirt to reveal a sewn up incision where my kidneys were. I stared into his eyes, mine widening. “You somehow lost your left kidney last night,” my doctor told me. “We don’t know how, though. Sorry, Mitch.”

The next night was my breaking point. Around midnight, I woke up to see a truly horrifying sight. I was staring face to face with a creature with a black hoodie and dark blue mask with no nose or mouth staring down at me. The thing that scared me the most was that it had no eyes. Just empty, black sockets. The creature also had some black substance dripping from its sockets. I grabbed a camera from the nearby mantel and took a picture.
Immediately after taking the shot, the creature lunged at me and tried to claw open my chest to get to my lungs. I stopped it by kicking it in the face. As I ran out of my room, I grabbed my wallet. I would need the money. I ran out of my brother’s house into the night. I eventually ended up in the woods near Edwin’s house and tripped on a rock.
I fell unconscious and woke up in the hospital. My doctor – the same one who treated me before – entered the room. “I have good news and bad news, Mitch,” my doctor started. “The good news is that you had minor injuries, and your parents are going to pick you up.” I sighed with relief. “The bad news is that your brother has been killed by some… thing. Sorry.”
My parents took me back to Edwin’s house to collect my remaining belongings, which I did. Upon entering my room, I was scared, but remained calm. I grabbed my camera and then stopped dead in my tracks. In the hallway leading to my room, I saw Edwin’s body and something small lying next to it. I retrieved it up and entered my parent’s car, not mentioning Edwin’s corpse. I looked at the thing I had picked up and nearly vomited. I was holding my stolen half-eaten kidney, with some black substance on it."	9.48	63.0	Azelf5000	01/05/2013
Gateway of the Mind	"In 1983, a team of deeply pious scientists conducted a radical experiment in an undisclosed facility. The scientists had theorized that a human without access to any senses or ways to perceive stimuli would be able to perceive the presence of God. They believed that the five senses clouded our awareness of eternity, and without them, a human could actually establish contact with God by thought. An elderly man who claimed to have “nothing left to live for” was the only test subject to volunteer. To purge him of all his senses, the scientists performed a complex operation in which every sensory nerve connection to the brain was surgically severed. Although the test subject retained full muscular function, he could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel. With no possible way to communicate with or even sense the outside world, he was alone with his thoughts.
Scientists monitored him as he spoke aloud about his state of mind in jumbled, slurred sentences that he couldn’t even hear. After four days, the man claimed to be hearing hushed, unintelligible voices in his head. Assuming it was an onset of psychosis, the scientists paid little attention to the man’s concerns.
Two days later, the man cried that he could hear his dead wife speaking with him, and even more, he could communicate back. The scientists were intrigued, but were not convinced until the subject started naming dead relatives of the scientists. He repeated personal information to the scientists that only their dead spouses and parents would have known. At this point, a sizable portion of scientists left the study.
After a week of conversing with the deceased through his thoughts, the subject became distressed, saying the voices were overwhelming. In every waking moment, his consciousness was bombarded by hundreds of voices that refused to leave him alone. He frequently threw himself against the wall, trying to elicit a pain response. He begged the scientists for sedatives, so he could escape the voices by sleeping. This tactic worked for three days, until he started having severe night terrors. The subject repeatedly said that he could see and hear the deceased in his dreams.
Only a day later, the subject began to scream and claw at his non-functional eyes, hoping to sense something in the physical world. The hysterical subject now said the voices of the dead were deafening and hostile, speaking of hell and the end of the world. At one point, he yelled “No heaven, no forgiveness” for five hours straight. He continually begged to be killed, but the scientists were convinced that he was close to establishing contact with God.
After another day, the subject could no longer form coherent sentences. Seemingly mad, he started to bite off chunks of flesh from his arm. The scientists rushed into the test chamber and restrained him to a table so he could not kill himself. After a few hours of being tied down, the subject halted his struggling and screaming. He stared blankly at the ceiling as teardrops silently streaked across his face. For two weeks, the subject had to be manually rehydrated due to the constant crying. Eventually, he turned his head and, despite his blindness, made focused eye contact with a scientist for the first time in the study. He whispered “I have spoken with God, and he has abandoned us” and his vital signs stopped. There was no apparent cause of death."	8.91	11.0	Anonymous	11/23/2009
Jeff the Killer	"Excerpt from a local newspaper:
OMINOUS UNKNOWN KILLER IS STILL AT LARGE.
After weeks of unexplained murders, the ominous unknown killer is still on the rise. After little evidence has been found, a young boy states that he survived one of the killer’s attacks and bravely tells his story.
“I had a bad dream and I woke up in the middle of the night,” says the boy, “I saw that for some reason the window was open, even though I remember it being closed before I went to bed. I got up and shut it once more. Afterwards, I simply crawled under my covers and tried to get back to sleep. That’s when I had a strange feeling, like someone was watching me. I looked up and nearly jumped out of my bed. There, in the little ray of light, illuminating from between my curtains, were a pair of two eyes. These weren’t regular eyes; they were dark, ominous eyes. They were bordered in black and… just plain out terrified me. That’s when I saw his mouth. A long, horrendous smile that made every hair on my body stand up. The figure stood there, watching me. Finally, after what seemed like forever, he said it. A simple phrase, but said in a way only a mad man could speak.
“He said, ‘Go To Sleep.’ I let out a scream, that’s what sent him at me. He pulled up a knife; aiming at my heart. He jumped on top of my bed. I fought him back; I kicked, I punched, I rolled around, trying to knock him off me. That’s when my dad busted in. The man threw the knife, it went into my dad’s shoulder. The man probably would’ve finished him off, if one of the neighbors hadn’t alerted the police.
“They drove into the parking lot and ran towards the door. The man turned and ran down the hallway. I heard a smash, like glass breaking. As I came out of my room, I saw the window that was pointing towards the back of my house was broken. I looked out it to see him vanish into the distance. I can tell you one thing, I will never forget that face. Those cold, evil eyes, and that psychotic smile. They will never leave my head.”
Police are still on the look for this man. If you see anyone that fits the description in this story, please contact your local police department.
Jeff and his family had just moved into a new neighborhood. His dad had gotten a promotion at work, and they thought it would be best to live in one of those “fancy” neighborhoods. Jeff and his brother Liu couldn’t complain though. A new, better house. What was not to love? As they were getting unpacked, one of their neighbors came by.
“Hello,” she said, “I’m Barbara; I live across the street from you. Well, I just wanted to introduce my self and to introduce my son.” She turns around and calls her son over. “Billy, these are our new neighbors.” Billy said hi and ran back to play in his yard.
“Well,” said Jeff’s mom, “I’m Margaret, and this is my husband Peter, and my two sons, Jeff and Liu.” They each introduced themselves, and then Barbara invited them to her son’s birthday. Jeff and his brother were about to object when their mother said that they would love to. When Jeff and his family are done packing, Jeff went up to his mom.
“Mom, why would you invite us to some kid’s party? If you haven’t noticed, I’m not some dumb kid.”
“Jeff,” said his mother, “We just moved here; we should show that we want to spend time with our neighbors. Now, we’re going to that party, and that’s final.” Jeff started to talk, but stopped himself, knowing that he couldn’t do anything. Whenever his mom said something, it was final. He walked up to his room and plopped down on his bed. He sat there looking at his ceiling when suddenly, he got a weird feeling. Not so much pain, but… a weird feeling. He dismissed it as just some random feeling. He heard his mother call him down to get his stuff, and he walked down to get it.
The next day, Jeff walked downstairs to get breakfast and got ready for school. As he sat there, eating his breakfast, he once again got that feeling. This time it was stronger. It gave him a slight tugging pain, but he once again dismissed it. As he and Liu finished breakfast, they walked down to the bus stop. They sat there waiting for the bus, and then, all of a sudden, some kid on a skateboard jumped over them, only inches above their laps. They both jumped back in surprise. “Hey, what the hell?”
The kid landed and turned back to them. He kicked his skateboard up and caught it with his hands. The kid seems to be about twelve; one year younger than Jeff. He wears an Aeropostale shirt and ripped blue jeans.
“Well, well, well. It looks like we got some new meat.” Suddenly, two other kids appeared. One was super skinny and the other was huge. “Well, since you’re new here, I’d like to introduce ourselves, over there is Keith.” Jeff and Liu looked over to the skinny kid. He had a dopey face that you would expect a sidekick to have. “And he’s Troy.” They looked over at the fat kid. Talk about a tub of lard. This kid looked like he hadn’t exercised since he was crawling.
“And I,” said the first kid, “am Randy. Now, for all the kids in this neighborhood, there is a small price for bus fare, if you catch my drift.” Liu stood up, ready to punch the lights out of the kid’s eyes when one of his friends pulled a knife on him. “Tsk, tsk, tsk, I had hoped you would be more cooperative, but it seems we must do this the hard way.” The kid walked up to Liu and took his wallet out of his pocket. Jeff got that feeling again. Now, it was truly strong; a burning sensation. He stood up, but Liu gestured him to sit down. Jeff ignored him and walked up to the kid.
“Listen here you little punk, give back my bro’s wallet or else.” Randy put the wallet in his pocket and pulled out his own knife.
“Oh? And what will you do?” Just as he finished the sentence, Jeff popped the kid in the nose. As Randy reached for his face, Jeff grabbed the kid’s wrist and broke it. Randy screamed and Jeff grabbed the knife from his hand. Troy and Keith rushed Jeff, but Jeff was too quick. He threw Randy to the ground. Keith lashed out at him, but Jeff ducked and stabbed him in the arm. Keith dropped his knife and fell to the ground screaming. Troy rushed him too, but Jeff didn’t even need the knife. He just punched Troy straight in the stomach and Troy went down. As he fell, he puked all over. Liu could do nothing but look in amazement at Jeff.
“Jeff how’d you?” was all he said. They saw the bus coming and knew they’d be blamed for the whole thing. So they started running as fast as they could. As they ran, they looked back and saw the bus driver rushing over to Randy and the others. As Jeff and Liu made it to school, they didn’t dare tell what happened. All they did was sit and listen. Liu just thought of that as his brother beating up a few kids, but Jeff knew it was more. It was something, scary. As he got that feeling he felt how powerful it was, the urge to just, hurt someone. He didn’t like how it sounded, but he couldn’t help feeling happy. He felt that strange feeling go away, and stay away for the entire day of school. Even as he walked home due to the whole thing near the bus stop, and how now he probably wouldn’t be taking the bus anymore, he felt happy. When he got home his parents asked him how his day was, and he said, in a somewhat ominous voice, “It was a wonderful day.” Next morning, he heard a knock at his front door. He walked down to find two police officers at the door, his mother looking back at him with an angry look.
“Jeff, these officers tell me that you attacked three kids. That it wasn’t regular fighting, and that they were stabbed. Stabbed, son!” Jeff’s gaze fell to the floor, showing his mother that it was true.
“Mom, they were the ones who pulled the knives on me and Liu.”
“Son,” said one of the cops,” We found three kids, two stabbed, one having a bruise on his stomach, and we have witnesses proving that you fled the scene. Now, what does that tell us?” Jeff knew it was no use. He could say him and Liu had been attacked, but then there was no proof it was not them who attacked first. They couldn’t say that they weren’t fleeing, because truth be told they were. So Jeff couldn’t defend himself or Liu.
“Son, call down your brother.” Jeff couldn’t do it since it was he who beat up all the kids.
“Sir, it…it was me. I was the one who beat up the kids. Liu tried to hold me back, but he couldn’t stop me.” The cop looked at his partner and they both nod.
“Well, kid, looks like a year in juvie…”
“Wait!” says Liu. They all looked up to see him holding a knife. The officers pulled their guns and locked them on Liu.
“It was me, I beat up those little punks. Have the marks to prove it.” He lifted up his sleeves to reveal cuts and bruises, as if he was in a struggle.
“Son, just put the knife down,” said the officer. Liu held up the knife and dropped it to the ground. He put his hands up and walked over to the cops.
“No, Liu, it was me! I did it!” Jeff had tears running down his face.
“Huh, poor bro. Trying to take the blame for what I did. Well, take me away.” The police led Liu out to the patrol car.
“Liu, tell them it was me! Tell them! I was the one who beat up those kids!” Jeff’s mother put her hands on his shoulders.
“Jeff please, you don’t have to lie. We know it’s Liu, you can stop.” Jeff watched helplessly as the cop car speeds off with Liu inside. A few minutes later Jeff’s dad pulled into the driveway, seeing Jeff’s face and knowing something was wrong.
“Son, son what is it?” Jeff couldn’t answer. His vocal cords were strained from crying. Instead, Jeff’s mother walked his father inside to break the bad news to him as Jeff wept in the driveway. After an hour or so Jeff walked back into the house, seeing that his parents were both shocked, sad, and disappointed. He couldn’t look at them. He couldn’t see how they thought of Liu when it was his fault. He just went to sleep, trying to get the whole thing off his mind. Two days went by, with no word from Liu at JDC. No friends to hang out with. Nothing but sadness and guilt. That is until Saturday, when Jeff is woken up by his mother, with a happy, sunshiny face.
“Jeff, it’s the day,” she said as she opened up the curtains and let light flood into his room.
“What? What’s today?” asked Jeff as he stirs awake.
“Why, it’s Billy’s party.” He was now fully awake.
“Mom, you’re joking, right? You don’t expect me to go to some kid’s party after…” There was a long pause.
“Jeff, we both know what happened. I think this party could be the thing that brightens up the past days. Now, get dressed.” Jeff’s mother walked out of the room and downstairs to get ready herself. He fought himself to get up. He picked out a random shirt and pair of jeans and walked downstairs. He saw his mother and father all dressed up; his mother in a dress and his father in a suit. He thought, why they would ever wear such fancy clothes to a kid’s party?
“Son, is that all your going to wear?” said Jeff’s mom.
“Better than wearing too much,” he said. His mother pushed down the feeling to yell at him and hid it with a smile.
“Now Jeff, we may be over-dressed, but this is how you go if you want to make an impression.” said his father. Jeff grunted and went back up to his room.
“I don’t have any fancy clothes!” he yelled downstairs.
“Just pick out something.” called his mother. He looked around in his closet for what he would call fancy. He found a pair of black dress pants he had for special occasions and an undershirt. He couldn’t find a shirt to go with it though. He looked around and found only striped and patterned shirts. None of which go with dress pants. Finally, he found a white hoodie and put it on.
“You’re wearing that?” they both said. His mother looked at her watch. “Oh, no time to change. Let’s just go.” She said as she herded Jeff and his father out the door. They crossed the street over to Barbara and Billy’s house. They knocked on the door and at it appeared that Barbara, just like his parents, way over-dressed. As they walked inside all Jeff could see were adults, no kids.
“The kids are out in the yard. Jeff, how about you go and meet some of them?” said Barbara.
Jeff walked outside to a yard full of kids. They were running around in weird cowboy costumes and shooting each other with plastic guns. He might as well be standing in a Toys R Us. Suddenly a kid came up to him and handed him a toy gun and hat.
“Hey. Wanna pway?” he said.
“Ah, no kid. I’m way too old for this stuff.” The kid looked at him with that weird puppy-dog face.
“Pwease?” said the kid. “Fine,” said Jeff. He put on the hat and started to pretend shoot at the kids. At first, he thought it was totally ridiculous, but then he started to actually have fun. It might not have been super cool, but it was the first time he had done something that took his mind off of Liu. So he played with the kids for a while, until he heard a noise. A weird rolling noise. Then it hit him. Randy, Troy, and Keith all jumped over the fence on their skateboards. Jeff dropped the fake gun and ripped off the hat. Randy looked at Jeff with a burning hatred.
“Hello, Jeff, is it?” he said. “We have some unfinished business.” Jeff saw his bruised nose.” I think we’re even. I beat the crap out of you, and you get my brother sent to JDC.”
Randy got an angry look in his eyes. “Oh no, I don’t go for even, I go for winning. You may have kicked our asses that one day, but not today.” As he said that Randy rushed at Jeff. They both fell to the ground. Randy punched Jeff in the nose, and Jeff grabbed him by the ears and head-butted him. Jeff pushed Randy off of him and both rose to their feet. Kids were screaming and parents were running out of the house. Troy and Keith both pulled guns out of their pockets.
“No one interrupts or guts will fly!” they said. Randy pulled a knife on Jeff and stabbed it into his shoulder.
Jeff screamed and fell to his knees. Randy started kicking him in the face. After three kicks Jeff grabs his foot and twists it, causing Randy to fall to the ground. Jeff stood up and walked towards the back door. Troy grabbed him.
“Need some help?” He picks Jeff up by the back of the collar and throws him through the patio door. As Jeff tries to stand he is kicked down to the ground. Randy repeatedly starts kicking Jeff, until he starts to cough up blood.
“Come on Jeff, fight me!” He picks Jeff up and throws him into the kitchen. Randy sees a bottle of vodka on the counter and smashes the glass over Jeff’s head.
“Fight!” He throws Jeff back into the living room.
“Come on Jeff, look at me!” Jeff glances up, his face riddled with blood. “I was the one who got your brother sent to JDC! And now you’re just gonna sit here and let him rot in there for a whole year! You should be ashamed!” Jeff starts to get up.
“Oh, finally! you stand and fight!” Jeff is now to his feet, blood and vodka on his face. Once again he gets that strange feeling, the one in which he hasn’t felt for a while. “Finally. He’s up!” says Randy as he runs at Jeff. That’s when it happens. Something inside Jeff snaps. His psyche is destroyed, all rational thinking is gone, all he can do is kill. He grabs Randy and pile drives him to the ground. He gets on top of him and punches him straight in the heart. The punch causes Randy’s heart to stop. As Randy gasps for breath. Jeff hammers down on him. Punch after punch, blood gushes from Randy’s body, until he takes one final breath, and dies.
Everyone is looking at Jeff now. The parents, the crying kids, even Troy and Keith. Although they easily break from their gaze and point their guns at Jeff. Jeff sees the guns trained on him and runs for the stairs. As he runs Troy and Keith let out fire on him, each shot missing. Jeff runs up the stairs. He hears Troy and Keith follow up behind. As they let out their final rounds of bullets Jeff ducks into the bathroom. He grabs the towel rack and rips it off the wall. Troy and Keith race in, knives ready.
Troy swings his knife at Jeff, who backs away and bangs the towel rack into Troy’s face. Troy goes down hard and now all that’s left is Keith. He is more agile than Troy though, and ducks when Jeff swings the towel rack. He dropped the knife and grabbed Jeff by the neck. He pushed him into the wall. A thing of bleach fell down on top of him from the top shelf. It burnt both of them and they both started to scream. Jeff wiped his eyes as best as he could. He pulled back the towel rack and swung it straight into Keith’s head. As he lay there, bleeding to death, he let out an ominous smile.
“What’s so funny?” asked Jeff. Keith pulled out a lighter and switched it on. “What’s funny,” he said, “Is that you’re covered in bleach and alcohol.” Jeff’s eyes widened as Keith threw the lighter at him. As soon as the flame made contact with him, the flames ignited the alcohol in the vodka. While the alcohol burned him, the bleach bleached his skin. Jeff let out a terrible screech as he caught on fire. He tried to roll out the fire but it was no use, the alcohol had made him a walking inferno. He ran down the hall and fell down the stairs. Everybody started screaming as they saw Jeff, now a man on fire, drop to the ground, nearly dead. The last thing Jeff saw was his mother and the other parents trying to extinguish the flame. That’s when he passed out.
When Jeff woke he had a cast wrapped around his face. He couldn’t see anything, but he felt a cast on his shoulder, and stitches all over his body. He tried to stand up, but he realized that there was some tube in his arm, and when he tried to get up it fell out, and a nurse rushed in.
“I don’t think you can get out of bed just yet,” she said as she put him back in his bed and re-inserted the tube. Jeff sat there, with no vision, no idea of what his surroundings were. Finally, after hours, he heard his mother.
“Honey, are you okay?” she asked. Jeff couldn’t answer though, his face was covered, and he was unable to speak. “Oh honey, I have great news. After all the witnesses told the police that Randy confessed of trying to attack you, they decided to let Liu go.” This made Jeff almost bolt up, stopping halfway, remembering the tube coming out of his arm. “He’ll be out by tomorrow, and then you two will be able to be together again.”
Jeff’s mother hugs Jeff and says her goodbyes. The next couple of weeks were those where Jeff was visited by his family. Then came the day where his bandages were to be removed. His family members were all there to see it, what he would look like. As the doctors unwrapped the bandages from Jeff’s face everyone was on the edge of their seats. They waited until the last bandage holding the cover over his face was almost removed.
“Let’s hope for the best,” said the doctor. He quickly pulls the cloth; letting the rest fall from Jeff’s face.
Jeff’s mother screams at the sight of his face. Liu and Jeff’s dad stare awe-struck at his face.
[speaker-mute]

[/speaker-mute]
“What? What happened to my face?” Jeff said. He rushed out of bed and ran to the bathroom. He looked in the mirror and saw the cause of the distress. His face. It…it’s horrible. His lips were burnt to a deep shade of red. His face was turned into a pure white color, and his hair singed from brown to black. He slowly put his hand to his face. It had a sort of leathery feel to it now. He looked back at his family then back at the mirror.
“Jeff,” said Liu, “It’s not that bad….”
“Not that bad?” said Jeff,” It’s perfect!” His family was equally surprised. Jeff started laughing uncontrollably His parents noticed that his left eye and hand were twitching.
“Uh… Jeff, are you okay?”
“Okay? I’ve never felt more happy! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaaaa, look at me! This face goes perfectly with me!” He couldn’t stop laughing. He stroked his face feeling it. Looking at it in the mirror. What caused this? Well, you may recall that when Jeff was fighting Randy something in his mind, his sanity, snapped. Now he was left as a crazy killing machine, that is, his parents didn’t know.
“Doctor,” said Jeff’s mom, “Is my son… alright, you know. In the head?”
“Oh yes, this behavior is typical for patients that have taken very large amounts of pain killers. If his behavior doesn’t change in a few weeks, bring him back here, and we’ll give him a psychological test.”
“Oh, thank you, doctor.” Jeff’s mother went over to Jeff. “Jeff, sweetie, it’s time to go.”
Jeff looks away from the mirror, his face still formed into a crazy smile. “Kay mommy, ha, ha, haaaaaaaaaaaa!” his mother took him by the shoulder and took him to get his clothes.
“This is what came in,” said the lady at the desk. Jeff’s mom looked down to see the black dress pants and white hoodie her son wore. Now they were clean of blood and now stitched together. Jeff’s mother led him to his room and made him put his clothes on. Then they left, not knowing that this was their final day of life.
Later that night, Jeff’s mother woke to a sound coming from the bathroom. It sounded as if someone was crying. She slowly walked over to see what it was. When she looked into the bathroom she saw a horrendous sight. Jeff had taken a knife and carved a smile into his cheeks.
“Jeff, what are you doing?” asked his mother.
Jeff looked over to his mother. “I couldn’t keep smiling, mommy. It hurt after awhile. Now I can smile forever.” Jeff’s mother noticed his eyes, ringed in black.
“Jeff, your eyes!” His eyes were seemingly never closing.
“I couldn’t see my face. I got tired and my eyes started to close. I burned out the eyelids so I could forever see myself; my new face.” Jeff’s mother slowly started to back away, seeing that her son was going insane. “What’s wrong mommy? Aren’t I beautiful?
“Yes son,” she said, “Yes you are. L-let me go get daddy, so he can see your face.” She ran into the room and shook Jeff’s dad from his sleep. “Honey, get the gun we…..” She stopped as she saw Jeff in the doorway, holding a knife.
“Mommy, you lied.” That’s the last thing they hear as Jeff rushes them with the knife, gutting both of them.
His brother Liu woke up, startled by some noise. He didn’t hear anything else, so he just shut his eyes and tried to go back to sleep. As he was on the border of slumber, he got the strangest feeling that someone was watching him. He looked up, before Jeff’s hand covered his mouth. He slowly raised the knife ready to plunge it into Liu. Liu thrashed here and there trying to escape Jeff’s grip.
“Shhhhhhh,” Jeff said. “Just go to sleep.”"	9.48	83.0	Anonymous	08/12/2012
The Momo Challenge	"I looked at the phone.  I waited for the text to come back.  It was maybe about ten, fifteen minutes.
That hideous face popped up on the screen, with the reply.
“You didn’t do the last task I asked of you.  Now, there will be consequences.”
The last task was done, actually, but not by me.  The phone I was holding was not mine.  It was my son’s.  I wanted some answers, something that would help me get through what had happened.  I needed to know the truth.
I wanted to know what made my son kill himself.
I had thought him being secretive was just because he was a teenager.  I remembered when I was a kid, I tried to hide things from my family, things I was embarrassed of.  But I never expected to walk into the bathroom to find him collapsed on the floor, his wrists cut.
It was one thing to just be suicide, but then there were the phrases on the walls, the symbols.  All gibberish, written in lipstick, on the mirror and the shower door.  “She tastes all,” and “Bend the circle.”
The Momo Challenge was what they called it.  A sick, twisted thing that looked like it was just for fun, but it terrorized people, mostly children.  I found out about it, and everything I read after my son’s death made me angrier the more I found.  That weird woman’s face wasn’t some demon, some creature from the pits of hell.  It was just a statue, that belonged on some weird bird creature thing in Japan.  They used it like an avatar, lured kids in with the promise of some good scary fun.  Then the increasingly frightening challenges.  Watching a scary movie alone was first.  Then, not telling anyone about these conversations, or else their personal information would go out.  Then the fear that ‘Momo’ would come and get them if they didn’t continue.
I never expected my son to be fooled by it.  But I read the conversation.  The things ‘Momo’ was willing to tell people.  I could see why he got scared.  They knew so much, all from a couple of clicks.  Hacking.
I never even knew what WhatsApp was, but my son used it to message friends outside of Facebook.  A friend told him about the number, but was too scared to try it himself.  So, my son tried it.  The friend never knew what was really going on, and was horrified to learn what had happened.  He would have never sent it along if he had known.
The police couldn’t do anything.  They said the number was a spoof, useless, probably a disposable cell phone, though it was odd that it wasn’t one normally associated with the Momo Challenge they normally looked into.  They knew the group did things out in South America, and there wasn’t much as local officers they could do.  They took the phone as evidence, but after they didn’t get anywhere with it, they returned it, and offered me their condolences.
They said it wasn’t worth trying to contact them.  They’d given their last command, they probably would ignore the number.
I didn’t care.  That phone sat in my son’s room, in a little Ziploc baggie, for weeks.  My wife didn’t want me to touch it; she didn’t want anything to do with the monstrosity.  She just wanted the memory of our son to stay as it was.
But I wanted to know why.  I wanted to know why people would do such a horrible thing.
So I texted back.  “I didn’t do your last thing.  I was too scared to try.”
Then I got that response.  Then another came through.  “You get one more chance, and then everyone will know your secrets.  Go to this address, alone.  It’ll be fun.”
My eyes widened.  The address wasn’t far from where I lived, maybe a few miles or so.  It would’ve been a fast drive.
If the group was in another country, they wouldn’t have bothered.  But this was local.  Maybe I would get answers.
I left my wife asleep in our room, but I took my coat and my handgun.  Funny, even though I showed my son how to handle it, I never got over the worry he might hurt himself with it, even locked away in my locker the way it was.  Now he never would.
I drove out to the address.  The neighborhood wasn’t great, but it didn’t seem like any place I would have felt unsafe walking after dark.  The house itself was a bungalow, dingy gray color on the outside, no vehicles anywhere near it.  There wasn’t even a detached garage.  All the lights were out.
I parked across the street.  I got out and went to the front door.  There was a note on it.
Come inside…if you dare.
The door was unlocked.  I didn’t bother knocking.
I entered a small hallway with a staircase going up, an entry into a little living room to the side, and a kitchen straight ahead.  Even in the dark, I could see the kitchen had old, flaky yellow wallpaper, and a small table with chairs at it.
The house didn’t look abandoned; just empty.  I didn’t see anything weird in the living room, so I went ahead into the kitchen.
I tried the light switch.  It flicked on, which I honestly didn’t expect to work.  A doorway led into a laundry room, another door led off onto a back porch, and a third with a security latch on it led underneath the staircase.  The room was small, but not uncomfortably so.
On the back wall, there was a note on the refrigerator.
Look inside.
I opened it.  There was nothing in there but a plate, with a note on it.
Surprise!
I heard footsteps behind me.  Thing is, whoever was attacking was expecting a high school kid, I’m sure, not a grown man, and not one who played football when he was younger.  I turned around and ducked down, charging the dark shape that had come down from upstairs and through the front hall.  I knocked him over, and I hit him again and again until he stopped fighting.
I couldn’t believe I had knocked him out.
I dragged him into the kitchen, pulled out one of the chairs, and sat him up in it.  In the light, I could see he was wearing all black, including a hoodie and a ski mask.  He also had a knife in his hand.
I took the knife away and dug through the drawers, hoping to find some rope.  I didn’t, but a junk drawer had a few unused zip ties.  I bound his wrists and tied his feet to the chair.
I pulled off his ski mask as well.  He was young, maybe college age.
I sat and waited for him to recover.  I kept my gun on him.  It didn’t take too long, and when he saw me, he went wide eyed and pulled at his ties.
“Who are you?”  I waved my gun at him.
“What the hell’s going on here?”  I expected him to be upset, and a little scared considering his situation.  But he looked more than scared.  His eyes were rimmed with lack of sleep.  “Let me go, man!  Let me go!”
“I want an answer.  Who are you?”
When he kept struggling, I kicked him in the knee, hard.  He yelped.  I asked him a third time.
“I’m just playing the game, man.  It’s what I was told to do.”  He started crying.
“Told what?”
“I started playing that challenge thing, the Momo challenge.  I looked it up, I thought it was all horseshit.  I gave them all fake info, so they couldn’t dox me.  But it figured me out.”
I relaxed the grip on my gun, but just a little.  “Who figured it out?”
“It asked me to kill myself, it would tell everyone about me, everything I’d ever done, unless I did it.  I didn’t, I told it to screw off.  But then the messages, the pictures…they stopped.  It just said it was coming for me.”
He sniffed.  “And it did.”
He looked over at the locked door.  “I went downstairs, in my basement.  It came for me, in there.  But I got away.  I locked it in there.  But it kept talking.  It kept saying it would come for me, it would get me, unless I passed on the game.”
He looked at me.  “I started getting texts.  I got information.  I told him to off himself, like I was told.  I was hoping he wouldn’t mail back.  But then you did.  And then it told me since the plan didn’t work, I needed to feed it, or else it would get me.”
He broke down and cried again.  “I’m sorry, man.  I’m so sorry.  I didn’t know.  I haven’t slept right in weeks.  I barely even know what’s happening anymore.”
I looked at him.  He looked downright pathetic, sitting in that chair.  Bawling away.
And I looked over at that knife.
He took my son from me.  And he planned to kill me.
I felt no sympathy for his sick, pathetic ass.
I smashed the gun across his face.  He screamed.
“Please!  I said I was sorry!”
I grabbed his chair.  I pulled it over to the basement door.
“You scumbag shit.  You killed my son.  MY SON!  And you think lying to me about some…thing scaring you into murdering him will make me feel sorry for you?!?”
He saw me unlatch the door.  His eyes widened again.
“NO!  NO!  STOP!  PLEASE!  DON’T DO IT!  I’LL DO ANYTHING!”
I opened the door.  I saw the stairs, leading down into darkness.
Perfect.  I leaned back, and kicked his chair.
He screamed as the chair tumbled down the stairs.  He landed at the bottom.  I saw him laying there, sprawled, sobbing and yelling.
“MY LEG!  MY LEG!  OH, GOD!  OH, GOD, NO!  HELP!”
I went to shut the door, when I saw it.
The long, thin pair of arms reaching out from the darkness, into the light of the kitchen.
The hair.  Long, black, scraggly.
The bulging eyes.
The body that was not on a chicken monster, but on a thin, pale frame, with a dirty, gray tank top.
And its hideous smile.
It didn’t look like Momo.  Not exactly.  But it was nothing human.
It dragged the chair, slowly, back into the darkness.
I didn’t think his screams could get any louder, but they did.
I shut the door.  I slammed the door latch back into place.
I waited, unsure what to do.  The screams ended, abruptly.
A minute later, just on the other side of the door, I heard a thin woman’s voice.
“Are you ready to play with me?”
I drove home faster than I ever thought possible.
It’s been weeks since then.  I haven’t heard from the police.  I haven’t heard from anyone about a missing person.  It’s just quietly gone away from our lives.
I know that there are sick people out there that get their jollies from torturing and frightening children.  I sincerely hope you can protect your kids and they are never exposed to it.  I also hope that someday what I saw in that basement will give them exactly what they deserve.
But I will not give out that weird, secondary number that it used.  I know it’s not some kind of angel that punishes the wrong people.  It’s not safe.
I know because I got a text the other day.  On my phone I erased it, but it’s still in my mind.
“I’m out now.  Let me know when you’re ready to play.”"	9.26	38.0	Seth Paul	03/02/2019
The Russian Sleep Experiment	"Russian researchers in the late 1940s kept five people awake for fifteen days using an experimental gas based stimulant. They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn’t kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras so they had only microphones and 5 inch thick glass porthole sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.
The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II.
Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past, and the general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the 4 day mark.
After five days they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering to the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself…
After nine days the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs for 3 hours straight, he continued attempting to scream but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior is how the other captives reacted to it… or rather didn’t react to it. They continued whispering to the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The 2 non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped.
So did the whispering to the microphones.
After 3 more days passed, the researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be coming with 5 people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all 5 must still be alive. In fact, it was the amount of oxygen 5 people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise. On the morning of the 14th day, the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives, they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the captives they were afraid were either dead or vegetables.
They announced: “We are opening the chamber to test the microphones step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.”
To their surprise, they heard a single phrase in a calm voice response: “We no longer want to be freed.”
Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day.
The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air and immediately voices from the microphones began to object. Three different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside. Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in ‘life.’
The food rations past day 5 had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject’s thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking the drain and allowing 4 inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four ‘surviving’ test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most if not all of them were self-inflicted.
The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, they had just been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days.
Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. They continued to scream to be left in the chamber and alternately begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep…
To everyone’s surprise, the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject’s teeth. Another 5 of the soldiers lost their lives if you count ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident.
In the struggle one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and he bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. When heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped he continued to scream and flail for another 3 minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word “MORE” over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent.
The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas demanding to be kept awake…
The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a 4-inch wide leather strap on one wrist, even though the weight of a 200-pound soldier was holding that wrist as well. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped. In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table, it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. His muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them.
The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, they try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire 6-hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patient’s mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers.
When the surgery ended the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. “Keep cutting.”
The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well. Although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation. The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak they were again asking for the stimulant gas. The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts and why they wanted to be given the gas again.
Only one response was given: “I must remain awake.”
All three subject’s restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military ‘benefactors’ for having failed the stated goals of their project considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, a former KGB agent, instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled.
In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again, the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone’s surprise, all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that at this point all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of the subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired for EEG most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time but sometimes flat lined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering from brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor only one nurse saw his eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of a deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped.
The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as 3 researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well.
He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. “I won’t be locked in here with these things! Not with you!” he screamed at the man strapped to the table. “WHAT ARE YOU?” he demanded. “I must know!”
The subject smiled.
“Have you forgotten so easily?” The subject asked. “We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.”
The researcher paused. Then aimed at the subject’s heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, “So… nearly… free…”"	9.58	53.0	Anonymous	08/08/2009
Of Emerald Towers And Crimson Children	"You know that feeling you get when you are deep in the forest?  Like something is watching you?  Maybe even following you?  But, of course, you continue on, because it’s just your imagination.  Except that it’s not.  The feeling you have is instinctual, and you should always trust your instincts.  In the forest, there are always eyes on you.  Too many to count.  Why?  Because you don’t belong, and your presence makes the residents feel uncomfortable.  See, the forest is pure.  But man, he is not.  When you step foot in the forest, you are entering the only true church.  And as we all know, when you go to church, you must confess.
I kneel to the powers accordingly, no matter how righteous I may think I am at the time.  The woods used to scare the shit out of me when I was a kid.  Too much of the unknown…too many creepy-crawlies.  And the hideous noises…of things I could never even begin wrap my head around.  As I grew, however, I began to look at things quite differently.  The hustle of the city and the falsity of manmade things tend to give a person the wrong idea of what it means to be alive.  If you trek into nature, you often see the reverse of what you have previously known to be the truth.  The forest is a self-sustaining cycle of birth, flourishment, and rebirth.  Death does not exist in the heavenly green.  Of course, states do change, but for the greater purpose only.  If a creature loses its breath, it becomes sustenance in order to strengthen the breath of others.  If a modern man loses his breath, he is encased in wood, concrete, or a metal receptacle.  It is a finite end of things.  The rot serves no purpose.  And that is not right.  Such death is only for the ignorant.
With such thoughts in mind, some might find it amusing that I am a man of the law.  I mean, whose law is it?  Surely it is not the rule of a higher power, but more along the lines of a kind of restriction on beauty and true freedom, written up by creatures who haven’t a clue.  This being said, I do try my best to make the world continue to spin on an axis of morality and general good feeling.  Hell, that’s why I signed up in the first place.  Men are not to be trusted, and need to be treated as such.  I bought in, 100%.  I made detective in just a few years.  I was making a dent, and it was noticed.  It’s nice to be noticed, by peers or otherwise.  It means you are doing your job.  And that’s all I ever wanted to do.
I remember the searing pain of the ligaments in my knee tearing away from the bone as I kicked the door in.  The little blonde-haired girl (who we had been searching for, for 6 weeks to be precise) screamed with a shriek that made the hairs on my neck stand on end as her captor sprang from the chair in that dimly-lit kitchen, obviously startled.  It was a big case, and all of Philly was searching for this girl.  I hadn’t slept in weeks.  It was fucking with all of us.  The details were terrifying…the perversions of the sexual abuse, the statements from the school, the confessions from the mother…it was one of those cases that you just can’t get past.  And the fact that the father fled with the girl instead of facing the charges like a man only made us salivate for closure even more.  I swore to the heavens that he was grabbing for his piece, but he wasn’t.  I don’t know exactly why I did it.  She was found, alive, and it was over.  But still, I painted the wall behind the man with the dark crimson of his brains.  And felt nothing.
It was during this time that I began my treks into the green, when I was at both my highest and lowest.  I was applauded as a hero for bringing this girl home.  It had national attention…interview after interview, camera upon camera.  I was the fucking man, no doubt about it.  But the secret began to tear at me.  I would hike for hours, limping along, looking for answers.  I would admire the emerald spires that jutted into the sky with impunity.  I daydreamed of climbing into them, up to the top-most branches, and simply staying there for days, until my body would give out from starvation.  The birds would violently pluck my dripping eyeballs out of their sockets and take them to their nests to share with their families.  Hunters could unearth my skyward remains by the end of next fall, when the leaves would go to rest.  But this act I’ve just described could be seen to some as cowardly.  And that just ain’t me.
Time passed, as did bits of sanity.  Amongst my peers, I became known as the man who could get things done, as well as the man who could find anyone.  I began to answer interesting questions, like “How many fingernails can you rip out with pliers before a pimp will talk?” or “How long does it take for a rapist to completely bleed out from a singular chest wound?”  I continued to make headway, and continued to do my duty.  The legend grew, as did my confessions.  My prayers were footsteps tread into the damp soil, my communion was the mushroom patch I found below the riverbed.  When times were particularly tough and actual guilt would rear its ugly head, I would dig my hands into the rotting cavities of expired animals and massage their purpled entrails, until the worms and ants would crawl onto me and attempt to feast on my living flesh.  I was not without penance.
I was at the very height of my powers, and had reached the crux of popularity.  I was now a public figure.  I had ‘fans’, as I guess you would call them.  They followed the cases, and, in some instances, followed me physically as well.  Honestly, it became annoying.  At the same time, though, it was all I had.  The job became my life.  I never married, never had kids.  Girlfriends were few and far-between.  My reputation fueled me, and the fame sustained me.  My confidence overflowed, along with the blood of these men, which I shed in the name of justice itself.  The skeletons were clawing at the door, but my bravado always kept them at bay.  I could not stop.
Her name was Madelyn.  Little red-haired girl, 11 years old.  Taken in broad daylight, right outside her home.  Her father had apparently done some bad things, and Madelyn was the payback.  It felt like the first time to me, when I had rescued that first little girl and blew her daddy’s brains out.  It kind of freaked me out a little.  It was somehow more emotional to me than other cases, and had my heart pumping even more than usual.  As the days fell away, and the severity of the situation grew, I found myself again without sleep.  But I knew I would find her.  I had no doubt in my mind.
We were looking for any and all leads we could find.  We even set up a hotline, specifically for Maddie’s case.  But nothing much was coming in, and the things that did pop up ended up being bullshit… “I think I saw her at the market”, “I think I saw her at the playground”, things like that.  Every moment that passed was another moment of pain and doubt.  I began taking longer trips into the comfort of the forest, a tainted man amongst the leaved obelisks that I had so admired.  I was no longer searching for confession, however, but instead for the power and grace to bring closure to this new issue the city was facing.  Most of the time I was perched on the stone outcroppings, thinking away, or with my feet dipped in the freezing stream as I wished for baptism, as I longed for grace.  I began to think about Madelyn’s captors, and what I was going to do to them.  It wasn’t going to be pretty.
I did have my sources on the street.  Most of them couldn’t be trusted, of course, but every once in a while you had a guy who knew how important it was to not burn a bridge.  So, surprisingly, seven weeks into the search for Maddie, I received a tip from an informant that the little girl was being held in an apartment downtown, near the historic district.  I should’ve alerted the department immediately, but I knew I had to go in alone.  If this was a worthwhile lead, no partner on earth would let me get away with what I was planning.  And the lead was probably bullshit anyways, so I didn’t want to make too big a deal out of it.  So, in the middle of a rainy, filthy night in Philadelphia, I set out to find Madelyn and destroy whoever it was who took her.
The apartment building was decrepit and nearly unlivable.  The musty smell of rot and fungus hung heavy as I moved carefully through the hallway.  It was amazing to me how such tenements were able to stand.  My heart beat faster with every step until I reached what I was looking for.  There it was…Room 104.  But something was unusual.  The door was slightly ajar, and I could see that it was dark inside.  Without any knock or audible warning, I pulled my gun, pushed the door open the rest of the way, and proceeded to hit the light switch.  The room was empty, except for one table in the kitchen area.  I could see that there was a piece of paper sitting on this table.  I smelled something strange, but couldn’t place it.  The lump in my throat began to grow.  I approached the table, afraid of what the paper might say.  The note read: TOO LATE, YOU PIECE OF TRASH!!!  Every word was written in marker, but the word “trash” was scrawled in what looked to be brown, dried blood.  Without pause, I rushed outside to the back of the building, in the midst of a full blown panic attack.
Every fiber of my being was banking on my instincts being wrong, but the truth was revealed to me as I ripped and rummaged through the black garbage bags in the stinking, rusty dumpster.  The scent of death hit me hard as I tore one of the bags open, and whatever heart I had left proceeded to shatter right there amongst the refuse.  It reminded me of doll parts, dipped in a red paint.  Arm here, leg there, hands off to the side, dismantled by an angry child in a fit of rage.  And there was poor Madelyn’s decapitated head, sitting at the bottom of the bag, her pretty blue eyes staring at me, missing the eyelids that used to accompany them.  Her mouth was contorted in some sort of frightful grimace of pain, her teeth clenched tightly.  I found her.
After Homicide was called to the scene and I struggled to provide a coherent statement, they carted me off and drove me to hospital, where I stayed for an entire week, apparently doing nothing but sobbing, screaming, and rambling about the green and how it had failed me.  I did the best I could to make it through the funeral, as I watched Maddie’s parents lose their minds in front of the tiny, black coffin, which held the bagged portions of their murdered daughter.  The situation broke me into pieces, and I was sure that I would never be able to be put back together the right way again.  I withdrew, and retired from the force, with nothing but shame, guilt, and the memory of Madelyn’s bloodied parts to keep me company.
What becomes of a man after he loses his identity? The man who I had prided myself on being no longer existed.  I failed that girl.  Not once, but twice.  I failed to rescue her, but I couldn’t pull myself together enough to find her killer, either.  No one ever did.  For all the people who I had saved, it was the one person I couldn’t help who made the rest of my career meaningless.  No more interviews, no more talk shows, no more façade of importance.  I faded into nothingness, and grew old and grey along the way.  I vowed never to return to the woods.
Maybe the verdant green had failed me.  Or maybe I was too tainted to be saved.  But the one thing that I knew as truth was that death did not exist in the forest.  Only rebirth.  It took years of feeling sorry for myself and unlimited moments of pain to piece myself back together.  I did not look the same, and I did not feel the same, but I knew that there was more for me to do.  My reputation was tarnished, and I wished nothing more than to get it back…to return to some semblance of the man I once was, howsoever tainted.  And then it happened.  Another missing girl.
I was no longer a detective, but simply an old, broken down man who wanted another shot at the past.  But I figured, it would be enough.  It would have to be.  Her name was Jocelyn.  Brunette, 9 years old.  Simply never came home from school one day.  The media was abuzz with the details and her photo, and it began to feel like history repeating itself.  I did contact some old friends at the department to see if I could get access to any leads myself, but they urged me to stay out of it…that I would only get in the way.  Apparently, even after all I had done, they had forgotten about me, too.  Pink jumper, white and blue tennis shoes, and her photo.  That’s all I had to go on.  But I would at least have to try.
The woods had not been kind to me.  I had searched for power, and had received failure.  I looked for purity, and found guilt.  But I knew that I had nothing to lose, and after much soul searching, I decided that I would return to the green, one more time.  One last confession, and one last pilgrimage.  I set out on my usual trails, admiring the beauty that I had missed during those lost years.  The perfect ecosystem, allowing me to behold the trees and stones and streams that seemed to know the secrets of humankind itself!  Again, I walked for hours, thinking of every drop of blood that I spilt, and every criminal who I had dismantled in the name of righteousness.
The thoughts turned to Maddie’s blue eyes, staring at me from underneath her red curls.  I wept until the soil around my feet was moist with hurt.  After I composed myself, I moved further, beyond the trails, into places I had never been before, yet seemed strangely familiar somehow.  My feet ached and my brow glistened, but I trudged on, until I spotted something out of place.  I saw a rusty drain pipe, off to my right, about two feet wide, popping out of the middle of a thicket.  What a crime…such a manmade construct ruining the natural beauty around it.  Very strange, I thought.  I moved closer to the pipe, and nearly fainted when I realized what I had found.
The shoe came into view first, then the pink dress.  It was Jocelyn.  Tears returned to my eyes as I got closer and saw the poor girl’s contorted body crumpled up inside the pipe.  Apparently the animals had already gotten to her, as most of the skin was missing from her face and hands…the bloodied skeletal features were plainly in view.  Whatever skin I could see was a transparent mush.  The water coming from the pipe, mixed with the girl’s remains, supplied the stream below with a steady, dark brown liquid.  Nature was claiming her body for its own.
The police were amazed at my find…they simply could not believe it.  As I was interviewed for the local news, it felt like old times, if even for a moment.  I had found her when no one else could.  I brimmed with pride, as I was again the hero of the day.  But deep down, I knew that I needed to return to the heavenly green, for another confession.  The only reason I was able to locate the body is because I was the one who had placed it there.  Men are not to be trusted."	10.0	11.0	Craig Groshek	10/11/2023
The Seer of Possibilities	"Sometimes, otherworldly beings find interesting ways to try and contact you. They might capitalize on your use of a Ouija Board, or maybe come to you in a dream, or sometimes they speak through another person. They each have their own style and preference that’s particular to them. The one who contacted Jack spoke to him through his computer, or more accurately, via onscreen text.
The first time it happened, Jack was seated at his PC, playing solitaire. A blinking red light from the router indicated that his internet connection was down again. This was a near-weekly occurrence, and Jack simply made note of it and returned his attention to his game. That was, until the screen abruptly went black. A moment later, red text appeared.
Jack wondered briefly if he’d been hacked, or worse. Then he read the text, and everything changed.
“Hi Jack, I need a favor from you. You’re a very special person and I know you’ll help me. I can’t ask this of just anyone. I really need your help.”
Jack was thoroughly confused. The router light was still blinking red. He couldn’t help but wonder if he was on the receiving end of some sort of joke.
As if in response to his thoughts, the message continued.
“ I know this is weird for you. But I don’t want you to worry, Jack. I have just a small, easy favor to ask. I’ll make sure you’re rewarded.”
Panic-stricken, Jack reached around and pulled the internet cable completely from the wall.
“Still here, Jack. I don’t want to waste any more of your time, so I’ll get right to what I need. Tomorrow when you go to work I need you to move the large potted plant that’s next to the elevator on the ground floor. All you have to do is pull it out three inches from the wall. If you do it at 8:17 AM, no one will see you, and none will be the wiser.”
Jack sat there, shaking and unresponsive, trying to figure out what was happening.
The writing continued.
“Look, Jack, I’m asking you because I know you’ll do it. You won’t let me down. You’re special. We’ll talk tomorrow.”
This time Jack pulled the power cord itself from the wall. The red text blinked into oblivion.
For a moment, Jack wondered if he was dreaming.
Still reeling from the experience, he took a warm shower and got ready for bed, all the while trying to convince himself that he’d imagined everything, or that he was the victim of some elaborate joke. But, he wondered, who would play that kind of joke on him? He kept mostly to himself, and didn’t have any friends, or enemies, to speak of.
He woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. His shift started at 8:30 AM, and Jack was never late for work. Each day he pulled into the parking lot no later than 8:10 AM. Normally, he’d just go right in, but the message had told him to move the plant at exactly 8:17 AM.
Was he really going to do it? Overnight, Jack’s fear had mutated into curiosity. What was the harm in doing as he was told? So what if he moved the plant? It wasn’t wrong, or illegal. The most reasonable course of action then, in Jack’s mind, was to move the plant.
Jack made up his mind. He’d do it – he would move the planet three inches from the wall as requested – and nothing would happen. Then he’d be able to put this whole crazy matter behind him.
One minute before 8:17, Jack left his car and walked towards the building. He entered the foyer at the exact time he was supposed to. The message was right; the office was unusually quiet. Jack found that odd, as the building was normally busy this time of morning, but the temporary lull had been accurately predicted.
Jack took a deep breath and made his move.
He walked up to the large potted plant placed firmly between the two elevators in the lobby of the 10-story building. The plant was clearly fake, the same decorative office staple that dozens of people pass by daily without realizing it. Jack was surprised by its weight. He put some might into his effort and repositioned the plant as asked, then stood back and admired his handiwork. He turned and cast a glance around the lobby. People were coming in behind him and the lobby was starting to fill up. No one seemed to notice that the out-of-place plant; nothing seemed different at all. Jack skipped the next elevator and waited for something to happen… but nothing did. Finally Jack entered the elevator and made it to his 7th floor cubicle, on time as usual.
Jack’s co-workers, if asked to describe him, would likely refer to him as polite, quiet, respectful, and competent. What they failed to realize is that Jack didn’t care for other people all that much. That’s not to say he disliked anyone; rather, he had very little interest in getting to know them or being their friend.
All save for one.
Allie, the girl two cubicles away, was the sole exception. Smitten by her beautiful smile, natural blonde hair and slender figure, Jack was very interested in getting to know her better. In spite of his poor luck with women in the past, he seemed to be making progress with Allie. Every morning as he passed her desk, he’d stop by for a chat. Their conversations lasted only a minute at first, then two, and grew from there. Jack was pleasantly surprised that she actually seemed to like him.
On this particular morning, as usual, they spoke briefly. While conversing about Allie’s wild night out, the elevator doors opened up behind them. Out hobbled James Bentley, their boss.
A moment later, everyone in the office was startled to hear Bentley shouting and cursing in pain.
Allie was quick to inquire. “Oh my gosh! What happened, Mr. Bentley?”
“Ah, it’s my foot! That plant in the lobby, someone ought to move that stupid thing. I ran straight into it and twisted my ankle!”
Bentley winced each time his injured leg touched the floor. Allie rushed to his side to offer her assistance.
“Mr. Bentley, sir, let me help you. You can barely walk,” came Allies’s concerned reply. “Do you think you’ll need to go to the hospital?”
“No can do; meetings all day. Too important to cancel. I’ll just have to tough it out.”
Jack left Allie’s cubicle mid-conversation and sunk down into his chair, stunned. It was his fault, he was sure of it. For a moment he wondered how could he have been so stupid and careless. Still, he reasoned, there was no use in worrying about it now. The damage was done. Besides, a twisted ankle would heal. Everything would be alright.
* * * * * *
Upon his return home, Jack went immediately to his computer and turned it on. As soon as the computer booted up, the screen went black, and a new message, in the same familiar red, popped up.
“How was your day, Jack?”
He sat there, staring at the screen, unsure how to respond.
The message on the screen continued.
“Actually, I know how your day was, but never let it be said that I’m not polite. You’re wondering what’s going on. You want to know why James Bentley had to twist his ankle. Well, Jack, this chain of events isn’t done playing out. I don’t want to tell you too much too soon, but this will all make sense to you in short order. Just go to work tomorrow like you normally do. Don’t worry about a thing, Jack. You’ll be rewarded. You’re special. Talk to you tomorrow.”
Jack sat back in his chair. What was going on? Who was this was sending him messages? Jack was curious – perhaps even a bit excited – to see what would happen next.
The next morning at work, everything was business as usual. Jack noticed that the plant had been pushed back fully against the wall, probably by the night cleaning crew. James Bentley showed up shortly after lunch, hobbling into his office on his one good foot.
“I tell you, my foot is killing me,” Jack overheard him say, but apparently his boss had a meeting he didn’t want to miss, and wasn’t about to let him injury get in the way of that. Jack didn’t see Bentley again until 3 PM, when he was spotted limping up to Allie’s desk.
“Allie,” Bentley asked, “you’re not doing anything right now, are you?”
“Um, no, sir. Nothing that can’t wait until tomorrow, I guess.”
“Good… could you please drive me to see my doctor? I probably should’ve gone yesterday, but I just couldn’t get away. I’m pretty sure I broke my ankle. I barely made it here this morning. and driving is practically impossible. We can take my car if you want.”
“Yeah, of course, Mr. Bentley, I don’t have a problem taking you.” Turning to Jack, she said her goodbyes. “See you tomorrow, Jack!”
Allie put on her coat and trailed behind Bentley as he struggled down the hallway. She gave a half turn and a shrug in Jack’s direction, flashing him a smile, as she walked away. Watching her leave, Jack began to realize just how much she meant to him, and he was determined to ask her out to dinner when she got back.
A few minutes, the entire office overheard the blaring of a semi-trailer’s horn, followed by the sound of screeching brakes, and lastly, a sickening metallic crunch. Even on the 7th floor the collision was loud. The office workers gasped and ran to the windows.
A colleague gasped. “Is that Mr. Bentley’s car?”
“Hard to tell from up here,” someone responded. “It’s so banged up.”
The horrifying implications of what had just happened were immediately obvious to Jack.
“No, no, no!” he cried. “This can’t be happening!”
Shaking, Jack ran to the elevator and headed to the ground floor, accompanied by several bawling coworkers. As they joined the growing crowd around the scene of the accident, Jack heard the far-off sound of emergency sirens. Looking beyond the gawkers, he could see that the 18-wheeler had hit the car broadside, and that Allie had been ejected from the vehicle through the windshield, and was now lying on the pavement, motionless. Still seated in the passenger side of the car, a look of shock evident on his blood-covered face. Jack couldn’t tell if he was alive. The driver’s side, where Allie had previously been seated, had taken the brunt of the damage. The space she’d once occupied had been crushed to a third of its original size.
The crowd was stunned. The combined sound of crying, screams and sirens was deafening. From his vantage point, James watched in shock and horror as paramedics attended to his former companion’s twisted, broken body. But even before they arrived, he knew: Allie was dead.
Jack sprinted to his car and raced home, desperately seeking answers. Arriving at his house, he stormed into his office and paused. There it was. His computer. He reached for the power button, but then hesitated and retracted his hand. He wanted to turn it on, but was afraid of what he’d discover. Was he really the one responsible for Allie’s death? The whole chain of events had started with him. In truth, he already knew the answer.
Finally, after several minutes spent pacing the room, Jack mustered the courage to boot up his PC. The screen flickered and then went black, and the familiar text appeared again on the screen.
“No, Jack, it’s not your fault. I know you’re blaming yourself. But all people die eventually, some just sooner than others.”
Jack stared at the screen. He resisted the urge to throw the monitor to the ground. After a moment, the writing continued.
“Jack, I’m going to tell you something, and I really need you to seriously consider everything I’m about to say. You thought you were in love with Allie. The truth is, you were just lusting after her. Forgive me, but every once in a great while it’s best to be blunt. Jack, she wasn’t the one for you. She would’ve made your life miserable. Yes, you would’ve found the courage to ask her out. She actually was interested in you. She thought you’d make a good ‘project.’ Sad for her, really, not for you. I want you to think back to all the things she told you. Why did her last boyfriend break up with her?”
“Because she cheated on him,” Jack mumbled under his breath.
“Because she cheated on him, Jack. She would have done the same to you. She would have made you happy for about two months, and then miserable for the next four years. Sneaking around, laughing at you behind your back, spending all your money. Once you finally got rid of her, you would have been so jaded that you’d never date again. This is true, Jack. I see all future possibilities, the ones that come to pass and the ones that don’t. You’ve seen how she really is, Jack, but you let your lust for her blind you to the truth. Together, you and I have made sure you avoided that path. One more thing, Jack; this isn’t done playing out yet. There’s more to come.”
“No! You monster! You killed her!” Jack screamed and threw the monitor from the desk. It landed on the floor in an explosion of sparks.
Jack barely slept that night, and the next day he wasn’t sure he wanted to go to work. But his curiosity had been piqued, and his anger had subsided somewhat.
No work was done that day at the office. The company brought in grief counselor. People shared their thoughts, cried and hugged. James Bentley had survived the accident, but was in a coma. The doctors thought he might recover eventually, but no one could be sure.
Late in the afternoon, Jack was approached by Diego Salbara, the head of his division. Salbara was blunt and upfront, and he offered James’ position to Jack. Technically speaking, it was a promotion, albeit intended to be a temporary one, but Bentley would be out for months, at least.
“Let’s keep this low key for now,” Salbara told him. “I know it might seem quick, but the Lancaster project Bentley was working on can’t be stopped. It’s too important to the company. I need someone in charge right away. This can’t wait.”
Stunned, Jack accepted the promotion. He left work with a strange mixture of feelings, not really sure how he felt about anything. On his way home, he stopped at the electronics store and bought a new monitor. He made it home and powered up the computer. Once again the writing appeared on the screen.
“Jack, I want to be the first one to congratulate you! I’m proud of what you’ve accomplished.”
Jack stared, unblinking, at the screen.
“Jack, I must beg your forgiveness. I haven’t properly introduced myself. I am the Seer. As I said before, I see what will be, and also what can be. Mine is a powerful gift indeed. But for all my power, Jack, there are… limitations. I can see and make predictions, and, with enough effort, I can communicate. But I don’t have a body. Regrettably, mine was taken from me a long, long time ago. That’s why I need you, Jack. Think of me as an artist of sorts; a painter, if you will. And you’ll be my brush and canvas. I want you to work with me, Jack. It’s quite simple. All I ask is that you complete simple tasks for me from time to time.”
In spite of everything that had happened, Jack had to admit he was intrigued.
“Before you decide, I’d like to make two things clear. First, I’ll never lie to you. Secondly, I’ll never ask you to do anything which itself is wrong or illegal. Yes, bad things will result, and sometimes people will die. But they’re going to die eventually anyways, right, Jack? And the bad will always be balanced out by something good happening to you.”
Jack winced at the thought of the harm he’d already done and considered pulling the plug again, but he fought the urge. Hadn’t he been misled already? After all, if he’d known at the time that Allie was going to die, he’d have never gone through with the original favor. Yet the more he thought about it, the more he realized that the Seer hadn’t lied to him; it had only withheld information. Moreover, the Seer was right. Everyone would die someday. Why not let some good come of it?
“Work with me, Jack. Together we’ll make incredible things happen. Oh, the things we’ll do, Jack! They shall have great consequences! It’s going to be beautiful, Jack, and you’ll be rewarded each and every time! That’s the beauty of my art. Simply complete one single, seemingly insignificant task, resulting in a series of events, and culminating in a wonderful reward for you!”
Jack stood, as if in a stupor, contemplating the meaning of it all. The Seer continued.
“Oh, Jack, I can see you’re having trouble with this. Do you realize that if I were to stop talking to you right now, and leave you to your own devices, that in the end it would make little difference? In two weeks’ time you would return, begging to join me… That’s right… you’re going to say ‘yes.’ It’s only a matter of time. So, instead of waiting, why don’t we cut to the chase? Let’s get started, Jack. When all of this is over, you’re going to thank me. I promise you.”
Jack considered what the Seer had said. His initial feeling of revolt was slowly fading. He paused, and then for the first time, he placed his fingers on the keyboard and responded directly to the Seer.
“What do you want me to do next?”
* * * * * *
As years passed, Jack did every favor the Seer asked of him, and as the Seer had promised, Jack was rewarded for his actions each time. The rewards often came in unexpected and interesting ways. One of the more memorable experiences for Jack happened about two years after he first agreed to get involved.
“Jack, I need you to go downtown tomorrow,” the Seer requested. “Enter Garmin’s Liquor at exactly 12:37 PM. A man will ask you a question. The answer you’re to give him is ‘27.’”
As always, the Seer’s instructions were simple and direct, yet mysterious. The next day, as requested, Jack entered the store. Standing in front of him at the counter, filling out a lottery slip, was a burly construction worker.
“Let’s see here,” the stranger mused aloud. “My birthday, that’s the 15th. My wife’s birthday, that’s the 24th. And my kids’ ages: 2, 10 and 13.”
The man scratched his head and looked around, zeroing in on Jack.
“Hey, buddy! I need another number. Ya got one for me?”
Jack smiled and replied, “27.”
“Really? I was thinkin’ bout playin’ 35. But you seem like a guy who’s in the know. Let’s go with 27!” With that, the man completed his slip and paid for his lottery ticket. “See ya, pal!” he said happily, giving Jack a pat on the shoulder on his way out the door.
Jack tried not to put any more thought into what would happen to this man.
“Just let these things play out, Jack. You’ll never guess how things end up, so just let yourself be surprised,” the Seer had advised him.
Still, it was impossible not to wonder about these things from time to time. Considering the way the Seer worked there was no possible way that he’d actually helped this man, but a losing lottery number? It was too simple, really. He couldn’t imagine he’d actually given him a winning number. So, when two weeks later Jack ran into the same man again, this time at the grocery store, he was surprised.
“Hey, buddy! I remember you! Check it out… I won!” Indeed, the man looked like a million dollars, dressed in brand new clothes, and sporting a new gold watch, not to mention a big, goofy smile.
“I didn’t think I’d ever see you again, but I’m glad you’re here! I coulda never won without you. Hey, lemme buy these groceries for you! No, wait… that’s not good enough! Hold on just a second…”
Reaching into his pocket, the man removed his checkbook and promptly wrote Jack a check for ten-thousand dollars. “It’s the least I can do for my good luck charm! Always gotta treat people right!”
After thanking the man, and feeling a bit confused by the whole thing, Jack raced home to his computer. After turning it on, the Seer’s writing appeared on the screen.
“Well, Jack, how does it feel to be ten-thousand dollars richer?”
“It feels good… but we’ve never helped anyone before. Why are we starting now?” Jack asked that question with a tinge of guilt. He never liked to admit that people were being hurt by his actions, but in this case his curiosity drowned out any feelings of remorse.
“Oh, Jack, we haven’t helped anyone. Yes, that man is happy now, but he’ll have lost every last penny within two years. You saw it for yourself; he just gives money away! Old friends, lost relatives…they’re all going to come asking him for money. And there will be some very bad investments as well. The stress of losing everything will lead to his wife leaving him. She’ll take the kids, too. He’ll be alone and broke, a ruined man who would have been much better off if he’d never won. You needn’t feel bad, Jack. It’s the man’s own stupidity and greed that will do this to him.”
Jack felt some regret, but the Seer’s rationalization, and focusing on his own reward, always put him at peace in the end.
Through the years, no two tasks were ever alike. Sometimes the effects of his actions were obvious; other times, they caused a chain reaction so complex that he simply could not follow it.
One such request, in particular, stood out.
“Go to the County Administrator’s building,” the Seer once advised, “and park in space number 43 at 4:47 PM.”.
Jack did as he was told, and two months later he met and fell in love with Donna, his future wife. He wouldn’t have known the two events were linked if he hadn’t asked the Seer about it.
“Jack, when you parked in that space, you caused the person who would’ve parked there to use a different spot. She bumped the car next to her. She barely made a scratch, but she called her insurance agent anyway, causing him to leave the office late. He missed his train home, and while waiting for the late train, he was mugged and stabbed. He’ll never fully recover. The muggers took his credit cards and used them.”
The complexity of it all made Jack’s head spin.
“You know, Jack, I could keep going with this, but there’s another 23 people involved. Sometimes these favors are going to be very complicated, but let’s just say your action ultimately caused Donna to be in the exact right place for you to meet her.”
Jack’s relationship with the Seer grew. Though it very much remained shrouded in mystery, over time the Seer divulged enough information, such that Jack, at last, began to come to some understanding of its nature.
From historical references, Jack understood the Seer was thousands of years old. When still alive, it had been a powerful fortune teller and artist, who foretold future happenings through paintings. A foolish king, who misinterpreted its prediction and lost a battle as a result, had the Seer executed. Unencumbered by physical senses and existing in a lonesome void, the Seer’s abilities expanded exponentially.
After some time, the Seer learned to communicate with the living, and began reaching out to those it found responsive, Jack included. The Seer, of course, appeared to know everything about Jack. All things considered, Jack considered the Seer a friend, albeit a dead one. Jack was grateful to the Seer as well. As a result of the agreement between them, Jack had a well-paying job, a nice house, a beautiful wife, and the respect of others. For the first time in his life, he realized he was truly happy.
Twelve years passed, each one – in Jack’s opinion – better than the last. Task after task was completed, usually about one every month. One day, while Jack sat in the office of his large rural home, he the Seer came to him with another request.
“Hello, Jack. I have a favor to ask of you. This one’s the easiest yet; you don’t even have to get up. Call Riago’s Pizza in exactly two minutes, and let the phone ring three times. Then you can hang up.”
Jack smiled, nice and easy. He no longer wondered about how these tasks would play out. He trusted the Seer and simply did as he was told. Jack made the call, exactly two minutes later.
The quietness of the household was broken 30 minutes later by the ringing doorbell.
Jack found this odd. Neither he nor Donna were expecting anyone. Jack looked out the peephole and saw a pizza delivery boy. The logo on his cap said “Riago’s Pizza.” Jack opened the door.
“Here’s your pizza,” said the boy, thrusting a steaming box into Jack’s hand.
“There must be some mistake,” Jack replied. “I didn’t order a pizza.”
“Look, I don’t care if you ordered it or not,” the delivery boy barked, before spitting into nearby bushes. “Mr. Riago told me to take it here, so that’s what I’m doing!”
Jack stared at the boy with a combination of curiosity and concern, and couldn’t help but notice his short temper and unusual appearance. about the boy was young – no more than 17 – but extremely muscular, and exceptionally tall for his age; possibly six-foot-six, or more.
“It’s already paid for by credit card,” the boy said, extending his hand as if expecting a tip. “Just take it.”
“I… I honestly don’t have any cash on me,” Jack replied.
“Whatever,” came the disgusted reply. The boy looked past Jack into the house, then turned and walked slowly to his waiting car, looking over his shoulder as he walked.
Jack closed the door and took the pizza to the living room, where Donna was watching TV. After explaining what had happened, he excused himself to go to his office, promising to return shortly.
Donna opened the pizza and took a piece. “Come back soon, sweetie. This pizza’s got all your favorite toppings on it.” Donna giggled as she took a bite.
Arriving at his computer, the Seer’s words appeared on the screen.
“Confused, Jack? Don’t be. Your neighbor down the road ordered the pizza. Mr. Riago told that boy the correct address, but a ringing phone made it difficult for him to be heard clearly. Still, you’ve got to give the boy credit; at least he got the street right.”
“So… my reward is a pizza?” Jack typed, a little confused.
“Yes, Jack, your reward is a pizza, but that’s not all. You also got the chance to spend a little time with your wife. Go down there, share the pizza, enjoy it. When you’re done, make love to Donna. That’s not one of your tasks; that’s just some advice I think you should follow.”
“Oh, by the way, your neighbors who ordered the pizza are arguing right now, over the silly fact that the pizza didn’t arrive. Some of the things people argue over amaze me, they really do. Their fight is going to get very heated, but you don’t need to worry about that. Go, enjoy your night.”
Jack followed the Seer’s advice, cuddled with Donna as they enjoyed their meal, and then made love to her on their big, comfortable living room couch. Donna fell asleep on the couch shortly after 11:00 PM.
Jack lay there awake, thinking about this latest favor.  Something about it just felt… odd. Carefully extracting his arm from under Donna, Jack left the living room and headed upstairs. Sitting down at the computer, Jack typed, “Are you there?”
“Yes, Jack, I’m always here. I’ve been waiting for you to come back. That pizza delivery boy, he was quite a specimen, wasn’t he?”
Jack looked quizzically at the screen. The seer continued.
“He’s a horrible employee. He was hired only three days ago and already Mr. Riago wants to fire him, but as a physical specimen, he’s strong, fast, and very observant. For example, he noticed that you didn’t lock the front door after he delivered your pizza.”
“What?” Jack asked, and he started to get up.
“Sit down, Jack. I need to tell you something important, and locking the door now won’t change your situation.”
Jack slowly took his seat again at the computer, looking behind himself as he did so.
“You see, Jack, it’s true that I never lied to you. Everything I’ve ever told you is 100% honest. But I’ve withheld certain… facts. You see, I told you that every task causes something bad to happen to someone else and something good to happen to you, but there’s a third thing. There’s an ultimate goal that each task was working toward.”
“Remember Allie? …Of course you do. What you probably don’t remember about her is that she was helping to pay her brother’s way through college. When she died, he had to drop out. He was going to be a great psychologist, but now he works in a factory instead. That’s really too bad for our pizza delivery boy. He could’ve used a good therapist a few years ago, but that good therapist wasn’t there for him. Instead he was attended to by some quack.”
“And remember our lottery winner? I know you do. He was a neighbor to our pizza boy, after he lost all his money, of course. He beat the boy senseless after the boy jumped into the street in front of his car. Quite a traumatic memory for our young lad. And his mother didn’t care about that incident, didn’t protect the boy at all. She couldn’t, not after using all the drugs given to her by her boyfriend, who happened to be one of the muggers who robbed that insurance agent. He bought the drugs with the money he made from the robbery. Do you see now the scope of my artistry?”
Jack sat, glaring at the monitor. He wanted to get up, to check on Donna, but he was too scared to move. The Seer continued.
“Jack, you’ve done over a hundred tasks for me, and each one has served an ultimate purpose, to psychologically destroy this boy, turn him into a monster, and bring him here tonight. Don’t you see, Jack? This involved tens of thousands of people, and billions of possibilities. If you had failed to complete even one of the tasks, the whole chain would’ve collapsed.”
“This was orchestrated by me, and set in motion by you. Together we’ve done something wonderful. This is a masterpiece of human manipulation. Our masterpiece. And it all begins and ends with you. Two perfect points in time. Tonight, after a wrong address and no tip, this poor boy finally snapped. He’s downstairs right now. He’s slitting Donna’s throat, at this exact moment.”
Jack heard a short, muffled scream coming from the living room, followed by a gurgling noise.
“No!” Jack screamed and stood up, starting to run downstairs.
“Jack, stop!”
The voice startled Jack. It was inside his head. For the first time, the Seer was talking to him directly. It was a pleasant voice, a feminine voice.
“You can’t do anything. She’s already gone. He’ll be coming for you shortly, and you can’t stop him.”
“But… why?” Jack cried, tears welling up in his eyes.
“It’s not an artistic masterpiece if it doesn’t begin and end with you, Jack… I want you to appreciate the fact that I’m speaking to you directly. This requires all of my energy, and as a result, I’ll have to rest for several years before I can contact anyone again. That’s how special you are to me. Please don’t feel bad about this, Jack. I want you to take a moment and enjoy our accomplishment as much as I do.”
After a brief pause, the voice continued.
“Do you know what, Jack? If I’d never contacted you, you would have lived for 85 years. 85 boring, meaningless, bitter years. And your funeral would have been unattended. I gave you 12 great, meaningful years. You were happy, and together we did something beautiful, something unique.”
Jack paused a minute and considered his 12 years of happiness, and his tears of sorrow mixed with tears of joy. He turned and looked at the computer, while behind him, the massive hulk of the demented delivery boy appeared in the doorway, a bloody knife in his left hand.
On the screen, the last words from the Seer appeared.
“Don’t you have something to say to me, Jack?”
Jack wiped his tears, and absorbed everything the Seer had just told him.
As his murderer approached, Jack said mouthed his final words:
“Thank you.”"	9.57	21.0	Craig Groshek	01/26/2015
The Borrow Box	"The box was delicate and ornately decorated.
As Todd Fowler held the small object, no bigger than a matchbox, he knew it would be very easy to destroy.  One wrong move of his palm, a finger gripping its surface too tightly, and the tiny box would break into even smaller splinters.  Meticulous patterns marked its surface, painted in red and brown with what must have been a magnifying glass and an impossibly fine paintbrush.
“What’s this?” he asked, looking back to the old woman who had given it to him without so much as a word.
“A borrow box,” she replied, her weathered, wrinkled face drawing up into a warm, yet sad smile.
A borrow box.  Todd rolled the idea around in his head and tried to make sense of it.  The two of them sat in Doctor Eichmann’s waiting room, a minimalist, antiseptic environment devoid of any interesting features to focus one’s attention on.  Even the framed paintings on the walls were shades of off-white, displaying nothing more than basic geometric shapes.
“I don’t understand,” Todd smiled back awkwardly.  “You want me to borrow it?  What for?”
“No, no, no,” the old woman shook her head, taking his hands in hers and closing them carefully over the box.  “It’s yours to keep.  It helped me for the longest time; now I think it can help you.  I got it for my husband, but he’s no longer with us.”
“Ah,” Todd nodded.  He reasoned to himself that this was some sort of religious trinket.  It seemed like something elderly folks picked up at church yard sales or through Christian newsletters.   Perhaps you were supposed to write out a prayer and put it in the box, or maybe its empty state represented a heart clear of wants and desires.
“Well, thank you.”  Todd put the box into his jacket pocket.
“Is your boy sick?” the woman asked kindly, but bluntly.
Todd looked to the office door.  Moments earlier, his wife and son had passed through, leaving him behind to wait.  The child had always felt more comfortable getting check-ups with his mother.  He told himself that it was probably that way for every family out there.  Kids love their moms – Dad is there to keep the rules straight.
Still, it would eat him up inside, sitting in that room for an hour or more, wondering if there would be good or bad news at the end of it.  His thoughts would race with visions of emergency rooms, medical machines, and a funeral that would come way too soon.  No matter how hard he tried to push those images away, they always found a way to sneak back in through the cracks.
“Yeah,” he responded quietly.  “Very sick.”
A loud clatter made them both sit up straight with a jolt.  The receptionist had returned to her desk and had flung open the partition that separated her office from the waiting room.
“Ma’am, are you ready to schedule your next appointment?” the receptionist asked flatly as the old woman pressed her cane to the ground and slowly pushed herself into a standing position.
Todd let out a deep sigh and shook his head, disappointed in himself yet again.  He should have returned the old woman’s sympathy and asked how she was feeling.  He suspected that she wasn’t concerned with that, and even if she had noticed his lack of interest, the moment had passed, regardless.
As the woman left, she stopped in the doorway and turned back to him again.
“You’ll know what it’s for soon enough.  Even I figured it out!” she laughed.  Then she added, “These things tend to work themselves out.”
Not long after that confusing encounter, Todd stood to greet his wife, Theresa, and son, Donald, as they returned.
He looked to her with a hopeful glance, eyebrows raised.  She pursed her lips and shook her head, causing his expression to drop again.  It was a silent discussion they’d have many times before, never speaking, in order to keep from worrying the child even more.  Still, Todd received the message loud and clear.  There had been no sudden turnaround.  No unexplained regression of the mysterious illness taking root in his son.  There was no miracle.
“Dad!” the boy called, pointing to the office window.
Todd turned and looked out to the parking lot, unsure of what he was supposed to see.
“What’s up, Donny?”
“Dad, there’s a butterfly trapped inside!”
Todd refocused his eyes and searched the window frame.  Sure enough, a moth was at the corner, perched quiet and still against the glass.
“We gotta let it out,” the child insisted as if every second mattered.
With his wife at the receptionist’s desk, Todd took the opportunity to waste a few moments making sure this new problem was solved.  The last thing he wanted Donny to think about right now was death, even one as routine and meaningless as the eventual demise of an insect.  Feeling his pockets, Todd retrieved the small wooden box and scooped the moth into it.  The almost microscopic hinges let out a barely audible, high-pitched squeak as he cautiously pressed the lid shut.
“There we go.  No problem, kiddo,” Todd winked before walking to the door to set the bug free.
As he stepped out onto the sidewalk and pried the lid open with his fingernails, he found that the box was empty once again.
“Did it fly away?” Donny asked as he and his mother exited the building behind Todd.
“Uh…” Todd looked to the ground to see if the moth had already been dead and had somehow fallen out.  Then, he briefly checked the air around him.  Finding nothing, he returned the box to his pocket and put on yet another false smile.  “Yup.  It took off right before you came out, and I think he said ‘thank you’ before he left!”
That night, the full gravity of the situation once again hit him.  Standing over his son’s bed, watching the frail boy sleep with weak, labored breaths brought to mind a sort of final rest that he was in no way prepared for.  Forcing the chill out of his spine and the clutching fear out of his heart, Todd kissed Donny’s cold, damp forehead and left to endure yet another sleepless night of his own.
He was taking too many days off from work, even though his boss was more than accommodating given the situation.  Even the most gracious and understanding person would have to fire him eventually.  Nothing about this whole ordeal was benefiting anyone.
“Is he okay?” came Theresa’s slight, trembling voice as Todd stepped into the bedroom, leaving the door cracked open.
He knew what she meant.  She wasn’t asking if he was any better, but whether or not he was worse.
“Yeah, he’s fine,” he responded.  “Nothing new.”
She sat on the bed in her white nightgown, reading one of many books on the subject of parenting a terminally ill child.  Todd watched her weary green eyes move across the pages, admiring the strength and calm he often found absent in himself.  Pulling off his boots, then undressing, Todd pulled his phone out and moved to check his missed calls before turning in for the night.
To his surprise, however, he found that he wasn’t holding his phone at all.
It was the box.
The same box that had fit in the center of his palm only hours earlier had tripled in size and now required a full hand to grip it.  The painted patterns were clearer and more defined.  He could see the tiny nails, no larger than thumbtacks, holding the bits of wood in place.
“What the hell?” Todd muttered, studying the much larger item with a critical stare.
“Hmm?” Theresa asked, her attention still on the book.
“Uh, nothing…” Todd stammered.  “Just…yeah, nothing…”
The box went into a drawer, crammed between rolls of socks, where it would supposedly remain untouched and intentionally forgotten.
The next morning arrived as they all had, with parents rolling out of bed just as exhausted as they had been the previous night.  As was tradition, Theresa would sit by Donny’s bed and coax him awake while Todd handled breakfast as best he could.  Eggs and toast were the usual choices since they were the hardest to ruin.
The two of them were awestruck by the change.
There, sitting at the dining room table, was young Donny.  He was all smiles.  He seemed energetic and enthusiastic about starting the day.  He wore a jumble of mismatched clothing that he had obviously picked out himself.
“D-Donny?  What’s going on?” Todd rushed to the boy’s side and knelt next to him.  Theresa covered her mouth in shock.
“What’s for breakfast?” Donny asked casually, as if nothing had changed.
“Feel his forehead.”  Theresa joined Todd, placing a hand on the boy’s head.  “Do you feel hot?  Were you sleep-walking?”
Donny pulled back from her hand with a frustrated groan, as if all of the worry was completely unnecessary.
“Please don’t make eggs again, Dad.”
Neither of them could explain it.  Doctor Eichmann couldn’t explain it.  The specialists they had been in contact with insisted that the boy must have been misdiagnosed, because such a sudden and perfect recovery should not be scientifically possible.  Todd wondered if, somewhere along the line, one of his countless promises or threats aimed at God had worked.  After all, he had gotten that miracle he was so desperate for.
Days passed, and Donny slowly gained muscle.  After a few weeks, he stood straight and no longer showed any signs of unnatural fatigue.  Within a couple of months, it was as if nothing had ever been wrong in the first place.  Despite Theresa’s lingering concerns, Todd taught his son how to play catch, how to climb trees, and how to socialize with others of his own age.  He felt a sense of pride that came with subtle pangs of shame.  Todd knew that he should have been proud of his son from the start.
Then, in the third month, it all came to a sudden and painful halt.
Donny was sick again.  Even though his symptoms were slight, and he tried his best to ignore them, his parents knew.  No matter how much they wanted to deny it…they knew.
Arguments flared up.  Theresa blamed Todd for pushing Donny too hard, for moving him out into the world before he was ready.  Todd bitterly insisted that if the boy was only going to have three months of relief, then it was best he had experienced a normal childhood.  Even if it would only be once.  The horror of outliving their son came flooding back like a repressed memory of existential torture.
Nights were sleepless again.  In those hours of darkness, both of them lay awake, but neither spoke.
The box greeted Todd as he reached the end of his clean socks.  Staying on top of the laundry wasn’t exactly at the forefront of their thoughts.
He pulled the box out and studied it again.  The question of how and why it had expanded to this size was enough to tie up his addled mind.  Pulling the lid open again, he searched the interior with his fingers, feeling for any sort of mechanical apparatus.  It seemed obvious to him that this was an illusion, a party trick or a gag gift meant to confuse onlookers.
“The magical, mysterious growing box,” he chuckled absently.  “Amaze your idiot friends.  Astound some drunk bastards at the bar.  Only available from Useless Crap, Incorporated.”
Todd considered showing the box to Donny.  A younger, fresher brain could probably figure the trick out more easily.  As he moved to close it, he noticed something had been painted on the inside of the lid.
Three tally marks, roughly scrawled with the same red paint as the exterior designs.
Todd’s heart felt as if it had dropped into his gut.  In an instant, a strange idea came to him.
Three months.  That was exactly how long it had been since Donny had made his recovery.  It had been three months since the box had changed its size.  Three months since he had put something living inside, only for it to vanish without a trace from existence.
On the face of it, the thought made no logical sense.  In Todd’s desperate state, it was entirely possible that madness had begun to creep in.  Still, he couldn’t help but repeat the words that strange old woman had said to him.
“You’ll know what it’s for.”
A borrow box.  Todd considered the idea that he might have unwittingly “borrowed” time.
That afternoon, Todd excused himself from the next visit to Dr. Eichmann.  He made an off-hand excuse about having to talk with his employer.  Since things looked grim again, he would of course have to ask for more patience and understanding from the company.  Instead, he spent that time testing the absurd theory he had come up with.
At first, he found garden insects to stuff into the box.  Finding that this did nothing more than upset the creatures, he came to the conclusion that a larger box might require more bugs.  Still, this yielded no result. Nothing vanished, nothing changed.  Somehow, he knew he still hadn’t come to the correct conclusion.
He fully embraced the idea that what he was doing was insane.  In the interest of leaving no stone unturned, he proceeded if for no other reason than to prove he had at least tried all he could.  There was no harm in trying, especially when his son’s well-being was more than worth going crazy for.
“All right.  A larger container doesn’t mean more things,” Todd mused as he stood in the backyard for what seemed like an hour, the sun slowly passing overhead.  “So maybe we need something bigger.”
He listened to the frogs croaking just beyond the property line.  The pond was full of them at this time of year.  He wondered how hard it would be to get a hold of one.  After yet another hour, with clothes drenched and shoes lost to the mud, he held his squirming prey with clutched hands.
“I just don’t understand any of this!” Theresa shouted as she returned home that evening.  She threw her hands in the air with frustration and collapsed onto the sofa.
“Is it…tell me it’s not worse than before…”  Todd swallowed hard, already feeling embarrassed at how he had spent the day.
The front door flew open, and Donny stomped through, running full tilt up the stairs and to his bedroom.  He was singing the entire way.
“Doctor Eichmann said it was grim.  He sat me down, and he asked if I was prepared for the day when we lost him.”  Theresa’s voice cracked, her mood was frantic, confused beyond all reason.  “Then on the drive home, Donny was begging for McDonald’s, and he was almost jumping out of his seat.  He’s full of energy again!  Energy and life and…it’s great, but what’s happening?!”
She gave up speaking and sunk into the sofa cushions with an exasperated sigh.
Todd looked at the shelf to his side.  The box, now roughly the size of a brick, stood there on its end.  The open lid wore six tally marks.
Those six months came and went in a joyful blur.  Donny never felt better.  Todd and Theresa had mended all but the smallest roadblocks in their marriage.  Any trips to the doctor only seemed to confirm, time and again, that the boy didn’t need to be there at all.
Todd never dared to question the strange process after that.
On the day he taught Donny to ride a bike, he found an injured bird that had been glanced by a passing car.  Its suffering was mercifully ended within the box, which then displayed twelve marks.  The sickness would be postponed for a full year.  As time progressed, Todd became accustomed to planning things out.
By the time that year came to a close, he had befriended a neighborhood cat.  Old and half-blind, the flea-bitten stray happily settled itself on a blanket inside the box.  Two years borrowed.  It was more than enough time to grow tired of the neighbor’s dog.  It was a vicious, loud mutt that they kept chained up and barely looked after.  Another easy four years.
After more than seven extra years in total, the box stood waist-height, pressed against the wall like a cabinet.  Its painted surface still as brightly colored as the day Todd had first laid eyes on it.  He opened the door from time to time.  What had once been a squeak of the hinges now echoed through the house as a deep metal groan.  Each time he stared into the shadows of the box, past the 48 tally marks on the inside of the door, his thoughts raced.
It was big, now.  Too big.  How large would the thing become?  How would he continue to meet its requirements, and what would happen once he could no longer fill it?  With Donny celebrating his 12th birthday soon, the days seemed to grow shorter and shorter.  Soon, he would need to find a way to solve the problem.
Through trial and error, he had learned just how limited his options were.  The box didn’t want anything unless it was alive.  Early on, he found that random inanimate objects didn’t work.  Meat, no matter the quantity, did nothing.  The box needed a life in order to give life.
What would that be?  A pig?  A small deer?  Could he even trap one?  He came to terms with the thought that he might have to physically injure some sort of larger prey.  He would need to keep it alive, and in pain, long enough to close it in.  The thought made him sick, but the idea of doing nothing could not be accepted.
Todd had tried to get in touch with the old woman years prior, but of course the doctor’s staff wouldn’t give him her information.  Routinely driving by the office in hopes of catching her there yielded no results.  He eventually settled into the idea that she had passed away some time after they had met.
Further, no amount of research shed any light on the box, and it had no marks to denote who had made it or where it had come from.
Theresa had become curious about the strange cabinet, but Todd explained it away as a woodworking project.  Something he had made while trying his hand at a new hobby.  The explanation seemed to work, especially since the box always looked new and definitely seemed to be hand-made as opposed to mass-produced.  She asked about making use of the thing, but he insisted he still needed to install shelves inside.
On the morning before his birthday party, Donny wasn’t feeling very well.  The fatigue was returning, and he had a pronounced cough that both of his parents recognized immediately.  Still, the boy insisted that the party not be canceled.  He claimed he was feeling fine, as most children would in his situation.  No one had the heart to postpone the party.  After all, if the illness had returned, there might not be another.
Todd was desperate.  He had waited too long, thought things over too much, and wasted precious time.  He became too comfortable and wasn’t prepared for the next step.
As he stood, sweating profusely, before the gathering of children who had come to celebrate, he found an unexpected sentence escaping his lips.  Something he hadn’t even intended to say.  The words felt dark and terrible in his mouth, and his heart raced as he realized what he had done.
“Let’s surprise him.”
He could barely utter the words without stuttering as he wiped the sweat from his brow.  Within an instant, the handful of other parents were turning to the kids and encouraging them to go hide.  Soon, Donny would manage to get his bearings and would drag himself down the stairs from his bedroom.  In the meantime, what could be more fun than hiding?
From the next room, Todd heard the groan of the box’s hinges.  The deep, resonating metallic echo sounded like the hungry growl of some wild, brutish beast.  Amid the excited giggling and whispering, he heard the door click shut.
Eight more years.
In the Fowler household, the mystery and heartache of a missing child were overshadowed by yet another stunning medical recovery.
Donny would live to the age of twenty.
The time quickly came for Todd to explain why the cabinet he had supposedly built by hand was replaced with a six-foot-tall armoire of the same design.  He stared at the tremendous box for moments on end before telling Theresa that a larger one would be more useful.  It would have much more storage space for important things.
Technically, it was true.
From that point forward, Todd was cold and distant.  He watched Donny grow into a young man.  His son was always energetic, always grateful for every day he had on Earth.  Adversity had molded him into a caring and respectful person.  He even volunteered his spare time after school to help others less fortunate than himself.
Todd told himself he had made the right decision…but had he even made the decision at all?
Another thing the old woman had told him came back to rattle around in his guilt-ridden psyche.
“These things tend to work themselves out.”
Was she speaking in general, or did she specifically mean that borrow boxes would create their own opportunities?  The concept that there was more than one of them out there was a notion too chilling to consider.
It wasn’t until he almost lost his wife that he knew it all had to come to an end.
Todd came home early from work, exhausted from both physical labor and the mental toll of what he had done.  After unlocking the front door and stepping into the living room, he froze at the horrifying sight in front of him. Theresa stood with one foot on the carpet and the other raised onto the floor of the oversized box.  She had all but climbed inside of it, screwdriver in hand.
“Stop!” Todd shouted, unable to control the volume of his voice.
Theresa poked her head out of the cabinet, a mockingly stern look on her face.  She smirked.
“Nope,” she shook her head.  “You’ve had more than enough time…I’m putting the shelves in myself!”
The fear that rose from Todd’s stomach squeezed the air from his lungs, making him light-headed.  In that moment, he wasn’t afraid of Theresa climbing into the box.
He was afraid he would push her in.
The feeling seized him like the sudden and inexplicable urge to jump from a cliff.  He didn’t want to lose his wife.  He never would do anything to harm her.  Still, something insidious perched at the back of his mind.
Donny could live to be thirty-two years old.  That was so much more time than anyone would have ever given him.
“Get out of it!” Todd shouted again, pressing his hands together and interlocking his fingers in a desperate attempt to keep them from shoving her.
Theresa frowned, stepping out and thrusting the screwdriver toward Todd, handle first.
“Fine.  It’s your project.  Whatever,” she sighed.  “I have everything ready to go, so no more excuses, right?”
Todd walked past her to the box, heavy door still hanging open.  He squinted at it hatefully, then turned back to Theresa.  He let out a hot breath before finding the words he wanted.
“You know what, honey?  I’m getting rid of this piece of garbage. I can do better.”
Theresa stepped back in surprise as Todd gripped the box on either side, rocking it back and forth and walking it away from the wall.
“Todd, seriously?  You can’t do that by yourself.”
Distracted, Todd turned his head and gave a sad half-smile.
“I think you’d be surprised at what I’ve done.”
Suddenly, the box began to tip forward.  He had pulled too hard.  Too recklessly.  It fell, the weight of its open door helping throw off its center of gravity.  Theresa screamed as Todd threw his hands out in front of him, finding only the back of the box as it toppled down onto him.  He barely had time to let out a yelp as he stared wide-eyed into the shadowy abyss.
These things tend to work themselves out.
Theresa ran to find her phone, and called for help.  There was no way she would be able to move the wooden hutch by herself.  When she stepped back into the room, she fell silent despite the urging of the voice on the other end of the line.
She found that the box, still lying face-down, lid open, no longer appeared to be what it once was.
Now, it was no bigger than a matchbox.
Dumbfounded, she dropped the phone and slowly approached the box, scooping it up in her shaking hands.
She couldn’t understand anything that had just happened, but she would have sixteen additional years to think it over.
In time, she would figure out what to do."	9.42	12.0	Christopher Howard “Slimebeast” Wolf	04/29/2021
Long Jaw	"I was running as fast as I could, but I knew it was gaining on me. I swear it was trying to step in every puddle so I knew it was running faster. I turned my head where I could see it. Its arms were limp as they swung back and forth in front of its torso, its disjointed jaw bounced up and down making an uneasy chattering sound, and its plastic-like face was splattered mud. How could I have ever let this happen?
It all started when my dad came home from work an hour late, being the realist that I was I figured he stopped for groceries or something. I guess I was half-right when he came in carrying a box about a human child’s size. “You mind helping me with this, James?” he asked.
As I went to help him carry the box I got a much closer look at it, it looked like an antique. The box was made of a very smooth decorative wood and the edges of the opening were made of a reddish metal. After we placed the box on the coffee table in the living room I asked Dad, “What’s in the box?”
“It’s a surprise for your birthday tomorrow,” he replied.
“How much did this cost!?”
“That doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t worry about that.”
Expensive. Ever since my mom died, Dad would always buy me far too expensive presents, mostly on stuff I don’t need. I would really want a new mattress for my room, mine feels like a pile of rocks and I find it really hard to sleep at night because of this. I was still thankful for whatever was in the box, of course, but I have to admit that the thing I was looking forward to most tomorrow was my friends coming over to hang out.
That night when I was lying in bed trying to sleep I heard a slight tapping coming from somewhere outside of my room, it stopped as quickly as it started so I overlooked it. I continue lying in bed trying to sleep. I continue lying in bed trying to sleep. I continue lying in bed trying to sleep. Giving up I turned on my phone to see that I had been trying to sleep for a little over an hour, in about forty-five minutes it would be my birthday.
I began to hear the tapping again. It wasn’t loud enough to wake anyone up, but it was certainly annoying. Unlike the first time I heard it, this time it didn’t stop, a continuous tap that felt like it was digging into my brain. Eventually, enough was enough and I crawled out of bed and left my bedroom. I followed the tapping around the house, soon being led to the box sitting on the coffee table in the living room. I sat on the couch and the tapping continued. Not being able to hold back, I began to open the box.
I woke up from Dad nudging my head with his foot. I sat up and looked around to see that I had slept on the floor outside the living room. “What are you doing down there?” Dad asked.
“I don’t know, I…” I couldn’t finish my sentence as I saw the box lying on the coffee table. That’s when I remembered opening the box and seeing two deep reflective gray eyes, on a beastly-looking doll that slightly resembled a dog. “What’s in the box?”
“That’s why you were sleeping on the floor?” Dad asked me. “Go on and look inside, it is your birthday now.”
I stood up and slowly walked toward the box, I opened it to see, not a dog, but a ventriloquist dummy, the only resemblance to the doll I had seen last night was the eyes. The dummy had pale skin, a big nose, and bright red hair made of the same material that the rest of the dummy’s head was. The bottom jaw was oddly missing from the head but I did find it under the dummy’s body which was wearing an all-black suit. The bottom jaw had teeth carved into it, which I found weird since the top jaw didn’t have any teeth and the string that I would pull to open and close its mouth was the same string that holds the bottom jaw to the rest of the head. I slipped the string through a hole under the top jaw where I could grab it behind the back of its neck. I tied the string on the end so the bottom jaw doesn’t fall off. The way the jaw hung there made it look much longer than it was.
“Do you like it?” Dad asked.
“Of course,” I replied.
“I saw it in a store window on my way home from work yesterday and thought of you and how you used to love ventriloquism,” Dad said.
I did always love ventriloquism; I had a ventriloquist act in my school talent show. While I was a talented ventriloquist, I wasn’t a very good comedian. I didn’t get any laughs, I would have been better off if the audience had booed me off stage. I put on a smile and sat the dummy on my lap. Through the dummy, I said, “Hello James’ dad, I’m Mister Long Jaw, you don’t mind if I stay here a while, do you?”
Dad laughed as he said, “You can stay as long as you like, Mister Long Jaw.”
The doorbell rang and I jumped up, setting Mister Long Jaw back in the box as I ran to the front door. When I answered it, hoping to see my friends, I was struck with disappointment as I saw my Uncle Zeke instead. I made sure that disappointment wasn’t visible when he saw me, however.
“Hey there birthday boy,” Uncle Zeke said. “How old are you today? I’m gonna need an answer, I really don’t know.”
“I’m thirteen,” I said.
“What? You’re not that old yet!” Uncle Zeke had bright blond hair and even brighter blue eyes. Being my mom’s brother, he was the closest I’ve ever seen of her, genetically speaking.
Uncle Zeke went over to the living room as the doorbell rang again. I opened the door to see my two closest friends, Rebecca and Tyler. Rebecca was a kind soul, but she was an absolute freak for the supernatural, Tyler, while also kind, freaked out with any mention of anything unnatural.
“Happy thirteenth, dude,” Tyler said. “That makes Rebecca younger than both of us.”
Rebecca punched Tyler in the arm. “James is only a week older than me.”
I let Tyler and Rebecca in and when we got to the living room, I saw Uncle Zeke holding Mister Long Jaw jokingly pulling up and down on the string chattering its teeth. Uncle Zeke noticed me and laid Mister Long Jaw on his lap before saying, “Hey, James would you like to introduce me to Mister Long John?”
“Long Jaw,” I corrected. Uncle Zeke picked up Long Jaw and carried it over to me. As soon as I touched it, the bottom jaw fell off and bounced off the floor. “Dammit!”
I picked up the bottom jaw and realized that the knot I had tied on the string was too thick for it to go through the hole, there was no possibility that it could’ve fallen off and I needed to untie it to put it back on. When I got up I made Mister Long Jaw say,
“Sorry, the sight of James made my jaw drop.”
“Wow dude, you’re really good at that,” Tyler said.
“You should really look into being a professional ventriloquist,” Rebecca said.
“How do you do that?” Uncle Zeke asked.
After a couple of hours of goofing off with everyone, Dad left the room to answer his phone, when he came back he said, “James, that was the hospital calling, they need me in the ER today, I’m sorry but I have to go. Keep Uncle Zeke out of the fridge.”
“Alright dad, see you tonight,” I responded.
“The thing is, you might not, they need me to work late tonight.”
“Okay, guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
“Happy birthday, buddy.”
After Dad left we continued to goof off until it got late. After Rebecca and Tyler left, I put on a ventriloquist show for Uncle Zeke. “You amaze me, James,” he said, “I don’t know how you manage to throw your voice like that.”
“I don’t either,” I said, “it just kind of came naturally to me.”
“Well, I better get going. I’ll be sure to tell your dad you did a good job keeping me out of the fridge.”
I went to the bathroom as Uncle Zeke left. When I came back to the living room Mister Long Jaw was gone. I figured that I had just misplaced it so I just went to bed. I didn’t stay in bed for long though as I heard a loud bang coming from the living room when I went in there to check it out I saw the box that Long Jaw had come in on the opposite side of the room. This shocked me; there was no possible way for it to get there. I was too tired to worry so I picked up the box and locked it in my closet.
Once again I wasn’t quite able to sleep on my current mattress and eventually I began to hear the tapping. I was expecting it to sound like it was coming from my closet, but I quickly realized that it sounded as though someone was knocking on the front door. I got out of bed and walked over to the front door. The knocking stopped as I got over there. I looked through the peephole, nothing. I turned around to go back to bed when I heard the knocking again.
I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife for protection, but just the thought of ever needing to use it made me uneasy. Once again the knocking stopped as I approached the door. I looked through the peephole and saw nothing again. I slowly opened the door to see no one around. I grabbed my house key from right inside the door before closing and locking the door as I went outside, I didn’t want anyone getting in while I was looking around.
I started looking around the house when I noticed something in the bushes. It looked like a hand. It was a hand. Mister Long Jaw’s hand. Somehow Long Jaw got outside and was thrown in the bushes. I figured this was just a prank that Tyler, Jessica, or Uncle Zeke was playing on me so I said, “Ha, ha, very funny” before grabbing Mister Long Jaw and unlocking the door… the door wouldn’t open, the top lock was locked as well, but you can’t lock the top lock from the outside.
I gripped tighter on the knife as I unlocked the top lock and went inside. If this was a prank, it couldn’t have been any of the earlier suspects because none of them had keys to the house. That’s when I thought “Dad.” He didn’t need to go to work; it was all a part of his elaborate scheme, a prank beyond all pranks. So I yelled, “Dad, this isn’t funny anymore, give it up.” No response.
I began to hear my phone ringing so I put Long Jaw down on the couch as I went to my room and checked who it was. It’s Dad. Of course, it is. He hears me yelling and calls me to avoid suspicion. I answer by saying, “Dad stop, this isn’t funny.” With which he responds, “What are you talking about? Listen, we need to talk.”
My heart skipped a beat, he was talking pretty loudly into the phone but I didn’t hear his voice around the house. “About what?” I asked.
“Uncle Zeke,” Dad replied, “Did you see anyone around when he left?”
“No, I went to the bathroom as he left. What happened?”
“Someone was in the back seat of his car and stabbed him in the back of his neck causing him to crash. He arrived here a few minutes ago, we don’t know if he’s going to make it.”
I dropped my knife before dropping to my knees. I looked around my room to see that my closet door was slightly open. I grabbed my knife again and stood up, walking toward my closet door. I opened my closet the rest of the way. Nothing was in there that was the problem.
I ran to the living room to see Mister Long Jaw sitting upright in its box with its bottom jaw lying on his lap. “What are you?” I asked. All realist thoughts fled from my head as Long Jaw lay down on its back and the box closed around it.
That’s when I told myself, “Enough of this shit” as I walked over to the box, knife in hand, and opened it. The dog creature I had seen before jumped out at me, pushing me onto the couch. I tried grabbing it but it wasn’t showing any signs of stopping so I sliced at it with my knife causing it to let out a loud whimper and fall back onto the coffee table. That’s when I looked into its reflective grey eyes.
I woke up by my dad shaking me on the couch. “James! James, are you okay?!” Dad screamed.
“What happened?!” I asked.
“That’s what I should ask you,” Dad replied, “I came in here and you were passed out on the couch with cuts all over your face.”
“Mister Long Jaw, the dummy, it’s alive,” I said, “It did this to me.”
“James, I’m going to need you to tell me the truth,” Dad said.
Why was I stupid enough to expect him to believe that? I had to tell him a lie instead. “We went outside yesterday and I fell into some bushes, that’s why my face is cut up and my mattress is uncomfortable so I chose to sleep on the couch.”
“Why didn’t you tell me, your mattress was uncomfortable? I would’ve gotten you a new one,” Dad said. “Here, I’ll get you one tomorrow.”
“Why not today?”
“Because it’s eleven o’clock at night today, you didn’t think it was morning, did you? Well, you’re going to have to spend one more night on that mattress. I need the couch so I can watch my shows.”
“Alright,” I said as I stood up. That’s when I remembered something: the knife that I was holding had disappeared. However, it wasn’t long before I found it since the blade was sticking out of my bed right where I would be sleeping. Like my mattress could get any less comfortable.
That night I had a dream, you’d expect it to be a nightmare but instead, I dreamt up a plan to get rid of Long Jaw, pretty much chaining up the box while it was still inside and lighting the box on fire. The problem was, Dad wouldn’t appreciate it if I lit my birthday present on fire, and it’s not like I could tell him that I didn’t like it so he’d take it back, I clearly enjoyed playing with it. That’s not the problem though, the problem is that Long Jaw is threatening me, and I’m pretty sure it was the one who attacked Uncle Zeke, who I regrettably discovered had died from his injuries.
That morning I called Rebecca and Tyler and told them everything. Tyler responded, “We have to kill that thing. Damn, this kind of thing isn’t supposed to happen in real life.” While Rebecca responded, “Cool, it’s about time I get to slay a demon.” I told them to come over as I put Long Jaw’s bottom jaw back on. I then walked over to Dad’s room to see if I could get him in the mix but was instead met with a note that read, “James, I’m out getting a new mattress for your room. Love, Dad.” I guess Dad’s never going to find out what happened today.
When Rebecca and Tyler arrived I picked up Long Jaw and showed it to them. “He looks like a dummy,” Tyler said, “and I’m not talking about the doll.”
“Hang on, Tyler,” Rebecca protested, “maybe it’s just hiding its true self.”
“Forget this,” Tyler said, “I should’ve realized that a living ventriloquist dummy was stupid. I’m going to the ice cream place down the street if either of you wants to join me, you’re welcome.”
Tyler leaves and Rebecca gives me a pitiful expression. “Oh, go on, I know you like him,” I said.
“Thank you, James,” Rebecca said just before she left.
“Tyler was right, you are stupid,” I said before throwing Long Jaw across the room. I sat down on the couch and began to cry. I then turned my head to see Long Jaw sitting up, staring at me. That’s when I thought of something. “You’re just a stupid piece of shit,” I said. Long Jaw then stood up. The only part of it still limp was its bottom jaw hanging by the string. I smiled as I opened the front door. “You’re just a shitty little bitch, and you should piss off.”
I darted out the front door and past Dad’s car as it began to chase me. I stupidly ran into the woods. The puddles splashing behind me made me realize it was running faster than I could, I looked behind me to see that its arms were limp again swinging back and forth and the mud from the puddles had splattered all over its face. I then took out my phone and video called Rebecca and Tyler. When they answered I showed them Long Jaw behind me.
“Shit! Don’t stop running, dude!” Tyler yelled.
“I’m going to stop running!” I yelled back. I put my phone in my pocket before stopping. I grabbed a stick that seemed pretty thick. As soon as Long Jaw caught up with me I swung the stick at it, breaking off the bottom jaw causing Long Jaw to stop running. “Take this, Mister Long Jaw!” I yelled as I swung the stick once more, knocking its head off into the mud.
Long Jaw’s body falls limp as I pull out my phone to show my friends on the video call. “You went for the head, that’s so cool,” Rebecca said. I then hung up the call and walked back home.
When I got home I saw that Dad’s car was in the driveway. I went inside to look for him and all I found was the same note on his door. Then I remembered: I saw Dad’s car when I left. I opened the door slowly to see Dad’s dead body hanging over the side of his bed. On his back was a note that read, “Don’t you recognize your Dad’s handwriting?” Then I heard a faint tapping sound coming from behind me."	10.0	13.0	Craig Groshek	01/30/2022
I’ve Got Your Nose	"I could almost smell trouble coming.
They knocked and I went to the large front window in the living room to see who it was.  I must have looked like the least possible threat ever with my little five-year-old feet in bunny rabbit slippers with whiskers at the toes.
He stood there, nose against the window glass, a man dressed in an optical illusion tie, its dizzying black-and-white pattern.  His face was acne-scarred.  He held up a Bible, mouthing for me to unhook the main door’s latch.
I went to the door, startled to see another man watching me through its tiny window.  He was perfectly bald and gave me a pleasant nod as I reached for the knob.  I tested to see if it was locked.  It was.  I stepped back and he frowned.  He thought I was going to open it.
“I’m not alone,” I said loud enough so he could hear through the glass.
“We’ve been watching you,” said the man.
The other came to the front door.  “You were playing video games and got some cheese from the refrigerator,” said the other.
“We’ve been watching,” said the man.
“We’ve got eyes,” said the bald one.
My body was on fire from all of the lights on in the house, and from the fast pace of my heart.  Outside, the entire place must have glowed.  I was afraid of the dark.  I believed in monsters, and they were in front of me now.
“You can’t come in,” I said.
“Oh, yes, we can,” said the voice through the door.
They took a rock from the yard and smashed in the front window.
I ran upstairs.  I had three rooms to choose from—two bedrooms and a bathroom.  I chose to hide in my bedroom, simply because I knew it well.  It was perhaps a bad choice.  They were in the doorway in seconds, like two great witches, shadows in a world of brightness.  I rushed to my window, opened it, and leaped.  I hovered there, choked by my shirt, suffocating in midair.  One of them had grabbed me. The other one’s hands seemed to run over the entirety of my body.  They thrust me into the room and threw me onto my magic-wand-and-stars bed sheets.
My feet were bound before I realized it, the tape so tight I felt sick, as if my circulation was stifled.  It was.
“Put your hands out,” said the man.
I pushed myself up and put my head on the pillow.
“He’s making himself comfortable.”
I noticed the knife.  It was our knife.  They took it from the kitchen.  I’d eaten hundreds of meals served to me from that knife.  It had cut almost every slab of meat.
“You should know,” I said, “that soon my Grandpa is going to be here.” He stabbed the knife into my bed.  The knife stood there, perfect posture, as if it was meant to be there all along, inches from my feet.
“You hear that?  His Grampa’s gonna be here,” said the man, “Well, how old’s your Grampa?” “I don’t know,” I said.
“Is he this old?” said the man, holding up all of his fingers.
“More,” I said.
“Is he in his nineties?” said the bald man.
“He has more hair than you,” I said.
“Well,” said the bald man, “I think we can handle ourselves with a mouthy little boy and a dying ninety-year-old.”
“He was in the war,” I said.
They laughed brutally, a slaughterhouse of laughter, something very pig-like and cadaverous about it.
I wondered what they’d do to me.
He withdrew the knife from the bed.
“That wasn’t nice,” said Grandpa from the hallway.
This frightened the both of them.  The one with the knife held it out, giving an empty swipe at the air.
My grandfather walked into the room and touched where the bed was bleeding feathers.
“Are you teasing my boy?” said Grandpa.
The ugly laughter returned, a conveyor belt of sniggering.
“How would you like if I were to tease you?” said Grandpa.
“We’re going to take every cent of money you have in the place,” said the bald man.  He smiled, a gummy smile.
“You mean like this?” said Grandpa and he reached to the man’s ear and, before he could react, pulled out a quarter.  He held it out for the man.
He knocked it out of Grandpa’s hand.
“Let me tell you something else, Grampa,” said the man, “We’re going to cut you and your little boy into microscopic pieces and scatter every one of your body parts all across the front lawn, for all the neighbors to see.”
“If they’re microscopic, the neighbors won’t be able to see,” said Grandpa.
He shoved Grandpa, causing him to fall into the hallway wall.  My view was partially blocked, but I saw Grandpa reach forward and grab at the man’s face, pinching his nose.
“What’re you doing, you idiot?” said the man.
“I stole your nose,” said Grandpa.
This was a game he did with me.  He’d form a fist and make his thumb protrude between his middle and index finger, the thumb supposedly looking like you had the person’s nose.
The man said, “Well, I’m going to saw your nose off.” The bald man stopped in his tracks, staring at the man’s face.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” asked the man.
“How’d you do that?” said the bald man.
“Do what?”
“Do you want me to put it back?” asked Grandpa.
“Yes!” begged the bald man.
Grandpa pushed his hand into the man’s face.
The man swiped the knife at Grandpa, who stepped out of its reach.
“How did you do that?” said the bald man again.
“Do what?” said the man.
“He took your nose off.”
“He didn’t take my nose off, you mumbling moron!  He just went like this—”  The man attempted to place his fingers like you do in the game.
“No,” said the bald man, “he took your nose completely off.” “Like this,” said Grandpa and he snatched at the man’s face again.
“There!” yelled the bald man.
“My nose is still—” but before the man could finish his sentence, the bald man pulled him to my bedroom mirror where it was indisputable that he no longer had a nose on his face.
The man patted at the nothingness that was there now.
“He must have put some sort of covering over it.”
“Can you smell?”
The man tried to smell but he had no nose.
Grandpa held out his hand.  An object like a nose was in his palm.
The man shoved the knife at Grandpa.
“You shouldn’t tease like that,” said Grandpa.
“I’ll tease you, all right.  I’ll cut the real nose off the both of your real faces.” “Put the knife down,” said Grandpa.
“Or you’ll do what?”
With that, Grandpa reached forward and took off the man’s arm.  He went to the window and threw the arm out.
“Do you want me to throw the rest of you out of the house as well?” said Grandpa.  “You must be more polite.  There are rules.”
The men looked flush with panic and confusion.
“Are you in on this with him?” said the bald man.
“It feels like my arm is actually gone,” said the man.
“You never told me you have a fake arm.”
“It’s called a prosthetic,” said Grandpa.
“I don’t have a fake arm!  I have a real arm!” said the man.
“Well, then how did he throw it out into the bushes?” “Give me my arm back,” said the man.
“Are you going to behave?”
“No, we’re not going to behave.  We’re gonna—”  The man didn’t know what to threaten us with.  He no longer had a knife.  That was outside in the bushes with the arm.
“What are you going to do?” said Grandpa.
The bald man reached to see if the man’s arm was there.  It wasn’t.  This seemed to anger him.
“Where’s the money?” said the bald man.
“What money?”
“The money in the house!  The jewelry!” said the bald man.
“Don’t raise your voice.”
“I’ll do anything I want,” said the bald man.
Grandpa leaned over and took off the man’s head.  He threw it out the window.  The head rolled onto the middle of the lawn.  We heard it yelling “Marty!”  Apparently it was the man’s name in the room.
Marty stared at the headless body of his friend.  A part of the man wanted to try to attack my grandfather, but a more intelligent part won out.  Timid, he said, “Could I please have my nose back, please.”
“Are you still going to kill me and kill my grandson?” said Grandpa.
“No, sir,” said the man, “I’m sorry about that, sir.”
“You’re sorry that you were planning on killing a family and stealing their money?” “Yes, sir.  I know it sounds horrible.”
“Sounds?” said Grandpa and he threw the nose out of the window.
The headless man’s body took a step forward.
Marty screamed and, gripping his Bible, ran out into the hall, down the steps, and out of the house.
We could hear the man below, searching for his nose.
The headless body just stood there.
“He’s very polite now,” I said.
“So quiet,” said Grandpa.
“Yes,” I said.
“Was he always this quiet?”
“No,” I said, “He was much more talkative when he had his head.”
“He probably misses it,” said Grandpa.
I hopped up.
Grandpa noticed my feet were still taped together.  He also noticed the tape on the floor.  He picked it up, sat on the bed, and bound his own feet.
“This is a good game,” said Grandpa.
He hopped around the room.
I joined in hopping with him.
The headless body stood there, unable to watch us."	10.0	19.0	Craig Groshek	12/31/2021
Autobiography of a Doll	"My first memory is of loneliness. Sitting forgotten on a shelf, detached from the world. Unloved and abandoned.
I suppose it was sometime around 1934, although I couldn’t recall the exact day. Like anything else in this world, I don’t recall the start of my own consciousness, or what, if anything came before. I do recall being taken to the first of many pawn shops and left out on display, and I recall the first of my many owners.
Her name was Melanie, and she named me Stephanie. She brushed my hair and polished my porcelain skin. She dressed me in such lovely clothes, and it was the first time anyone had ever cared about me. I loved Melanie. She was my first, and at the time, my only friend.
She played with me every day, carrying me with ease although I was over half her small size. She treated me to the loveliest of imaginary tea parties with her other toys. Reginald D. Bear and Kennedy, another doll. But Kennedy could not speak or hear. She could not think. She looked like me, but she wasn’t the same as me. She was a real doll. A normal doll, and it didn’t take me long to realize that I was something else entirely.
My ball-jointed limbs were never fast, but I practiced when Melanie was gone or asleep. I did it in secret because was afraid if I failed in front of her, then maybe she wouldn’t like me anymore. She was never a mean-spirited child, but even in my earliest days I knew the fear of rejection. Speech came easily for me, and with practice, the walking came too. A few times, I woke Melanie up in the night. She’d sit up in bed, looking around warily as I sat perfectly still. Stillness came naturally to me. In time, I convinced myself I was ready to show Melanie the fruits of my labor.
I waited for her to set up that days’s tea party with Mr. Bear and Kennedy on either side of me. I would be sitting across the table from Melanie. I would be able to show her what I was, that I could play back, that I could be her friend! As Melanie poured me a cup of imaginary tea, I reached out to pick it up, and for the first time, I spoke to her.
“Thank you, Melanie.”
She stared at me, wide-eyed and horrified as I pretended to sip from the empty cup. That was when the screaming started.
I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to ask why. I wanted to silence her. To assure her everything was fine. But as I stood up from the chair and watched her shrink back from me, I realized that there was nothing I could say or do. I sat back down in the chair as Melanie’s parents came rushing in and she told them what she’d seen. I stayed motionless, playing the part of a perfect toy, hoping I could explain it to her later. But later never came. She refused to go near me, and so I was taken away. Brought back to the Pawn Shop and replaced.
The only good thing about pawn shops is that you aren’t left wanting for entertainment. The isolation can weigh on you sometimes, but it really isn’t so bad. For the first little while, I sat on my shelf, waiting to be taken home by another little girl, hoping that maybe, just maybe she would accept me. After all, I was better than the other dolls! I could love her back! But I was always passed by, again and again. When the store closed for the night, I would get off my shelf and wander over to the shop’s modest book collection, where I’d sit and read. Reading was wonderful. It taught me so much about the world around me. As a doll, there was very little I could do. I’d never explore the world. I’d never have a great adventure. I’d never save a life. I’d never fall in love. Most of the things that people could do were closed off to me. I was nothing more than wood and porcelain. Fragile, unsleeping, inhuman, yet alive.
I was overjoyed when I was picked up again by another little girl, Sharon. But in my joy, I was not reckless. I remembered how afraid Melanie had been, and I didn’t want to ruin my second chance! I was quiet, I watched for over a year, learning about her, and trying to gauge whether or not she’d accept me! Of course, I left little hints, just to see if she’d notice. As she slept, I’d change positions. Sit somewhere else. Create fun little displays for her to wake up to. Sometimes, I’d take a book out from her Father’s study to read. Once or twice, I got so absorbed in it, I’d forget to put it back before she woke up. Sharon got in trouble for that, so I had to stop doing it. While I never spoke to her, Sharon still seemed to figure out just what was going on. She traced it all back to me, and just as I’d feared, she began to distance herself from me. She stuffed me into the back of her closet and forgot about me, until years later when I was sold to another pawn shop.
And thus continued the cycle of my life. Someone, usually a little girl, would buy me, and in time, my efforts to drop hints about what I was scared them off. Once, I was even outright thrown into the trash. I fished myself out that evening and spent the night walking to the nearest pawn shop, because I had no intention of being thrown out with the rest of the trash!
Life was a miserable affair… and as time went on, I began to question the ‘why’ of my own existence. The people around me aged. The world changed. But there I was. Ageless. Eternal. Sleepless. Sitting on the shelves of countless pawn shops. I went from days, to weeks, to months, and finally to years, without being bought. So much time alone, and trying to occupy myself. So much time being bounced from home to home because no one ever wanted me.
The world changed, and so did I.
I began to anticipate my inevitable disposal. In a desperate search for purpose, I embraced my status as a ‘creepy doll’. What else could I do? My mischief was harmless. When people weren’t looking, I’d move. I’d go to different rooms. I’d follow people I didn’t like around the house just to see the unease on their faces. In the darkness of the night, I would stand outside the rooms of my victims and giggle, just because I could! I was alive, and they knew it! My existence ran contrary to their understanding of the world, however, and so they denied my reality, or assumed I meant anything more than harmless mischief with which to pass my lonely existence.
There were times where I contemplated revealing my true self to the world. I wondered what they would make of me, but in the end, I decided it wasn’t worth it. The unpredictability of it put me off. I’d read enough stories where the abnormalities of the world were torn apart and studied. That had no appeal to me. I didn’t feel pain, but I was fairly certain that I could die. I was miserable, but I had no interest in death. Not while there was so much life to still live!
Even when I had no home, I could torment the Pawn Shop workers as much as I wanted. It was the only form of interaction I could get, and so I took it! For 70 years I drifted through the English countryside. I existed, and while it was not a perfect existence, it was mine.
Then Celeste came along…
It had been almost seven years since I’d been owned. I was in a Liverpool pawn shop at the time, where I spent my days teasing the workers, and my nights reading quietly in the furniture section. I thought nothing of the dark-haired woman in her mid 20’s who came in that day. Just another customer, probably looking for vintage records or secondhand books.
Her outfit was all black, and her hair dyed to look like the twilight sky. She walked through the aisles, pausing to look at me for a moment. My glass eyes met hers, and she reached out, ready to pick me up.
“Can I help you?” The voice belonged to Shauna, a Clerk I’d been teasing for the past year. She eyed me warily.
“Oh, just browsing!” the woman replied, “I was just passing through town, I thought I’d take a look!”
“Well, if you need anything, I’m here!” Shauna said, subtly trying to lure the woman away from me. But the woman didn’t move.
“Thanks, actually… I heard about this place from a friend. I’m working on a horror podcast. Local ghost stories and the like. I was actually wondering if you’d had any experiences while you were working here?”Shauna smiled warily, eyes shifting over to me.
“Well, we do have a few stories. You’re looking at one, actually. That there’s Stephanie.”
The woman looked back at me as Shauna continued.
“I figure someones just having a bit of fun with her. Moving her around and the like. But that doesn’t make it any less creepy…” There was no conviction in her words. Just a thin attempt at masking what she knew, and that woman saw right through it.
“Have you ever seen anyone move her?” she asked.
“Ah… Not exactly. There’s been no deaths or anything, so it’s not like she’s cursed. Just harmless pranks. One of the girls who was here a few years back used to blame ‘em on Stephanie. Honestly, I think it’s just people having a bit of fun at each other’s expenses. What else would you do with a creepy old doll?”
“Well, I think she’s pretty,” the woman said, reaching out once again to pick me up.
“No, wait!”
The protest slipped out of Shauna’s mouth, and the woman looked back at her.
“What’s wrong?”
“Sorry… She… She’s just really fragile. Be careful.”
“I promise I will.” The woman said, and picked me up, looking me over.
“She’s in amazing condition… Is she for sale?”
“Yeah, of course.” Shauna still watched me nervously, but honestly, any mischievous intentions I had were already quashed. I was keen to find a new home. Maybe this woman had a little girl I’d be perfect for! My last owner had been someone’s Grandmother, and I spent most of my time sitting on a shelf, bored out of my little porcelain skull as she watched endless crime shows on TV.
My new owner smiled, and took me over to the register to check me out right away.
“I think I’ll take her off your hands then!”
Shauna seemed happy to see me go, and chatted with my New Owner about podcasts and ghosts as I was rung up and packed in a bag. Then, she carried me out into her car, putting me into the backseat lovingly before she drove me home.
Her name was Celeste. During the day, she worked from home as a Graphic Designer. She had a little workspace set up in her basement, among other things. Her basement was a strange mixture of rec room, office and shrine to horror films and ‘creepy’ collectibles. My place of honor in her basement was on a small chair set aside just for me. From that chair, I could see almost everything. The walls were mostly decorated in framed movie posters, save for one that held a large TV and two matching tall shelves filled with movies and books.
Celeste’s sofa had a small lap desk that she sat her computer on as she worked. She was down in that basement almost every day, working on her laptop. Sometimes she used the TV as an extra monitor. But when she wasn’t using it, she played horror movies. Then, when the workday was done, she’d work on something else. Her own little horror podcast that she kept on the backburner.
She’d write her scripts, record the audio and sometimes invite people over as guests. From what I understood, the podcast was mostly about scary movies and ghost stories. One couldn’t say she wasn’t consistent. But despite her busy schedule, I never felt neglected by Celeste. She’d bought me a new dress shortly after bringing me home. She combed my hair and made me feel new again. She wasn’t a child, and so she never played with me. There were no tea parties or games of make-believe. But I didn’t mind. I felt loved all the same. I wasn’t alone anymore. From my vantage point, I only needed to turn my head to see her TV. I rather enjoyed her addiction to horror movies, but otherwise, her life seemed fairly quiet.
I bided my time, thinking about how best to make my presence known to her. I started off by rearranging some of her trinkets. A few models of movie monsters. They had been positioned on a shelf, so I put them into a silly little tableau. The Alien and Freddy Kreuger stood around the funeral of Jason Voorhes. Or they’d just murdered him and were discussing how best to deal with the body. Once I’d done the deed, I returned to my spot, giggling wildly and waited for her to come downstairs.
What I hadn’t expected was for the Alien to fall off the shelf, and lose his head. But lo and behold that is exactly what he did! I got up to try and fix it, but with no luck, and so I left it on the floor, in hopes that Celeste would blame the fall. When she came downstairs, she paused, and went to go and pick up the fallen figure. A visible frown crossed her lips for a moment, before she took something from the top shelf.
“A little glue fixes everything…” she said under her breath, as she took the time to fix the model. It was only after she’d finished up that she noticed my tableau, and by then it no longer had the effect I’d wanted. She put everything back in place, then went to turn on a movie. As it played, I turned my head to watch it with her, and I must admit I found myself getting quite absorbed. Enough so that when she stood up to get a beer from her mini-fridge, she saw me. I remained still as Celeste stared at me, head turned to watch the TV. Then, she drew closer. She knelt down in front of my chair, and turned my head to look into her eyes.
For several moments she stared, letting the movie play out behind us. It was the longest anyone had looked at me, really looked at me in decades. It was both uncomfortable and… nice. I felt noticed. I felt appreciated. Her fingers ran over my porcelain cheeks. She brushed the hair out of my eyes, before finally leaving me to get her beer. She glanced at me one final time before returning to her movie. It was then that I opted to push the envelope, as it were.
The next night, I went to go and sit on the couch. I sat there reading for the longest time, until morning, when I heard the shower run. Then I just kept my stationary vigil on the couch, wondering just how Celeste would react. As she came down to her little den, laptop under her arm, Celeste paused to stare at me. She set her laptop down, and picked me up. I felt certain she’d put me back in my chair, but the oddest little smile crossed her lips. She set me back down, and then she spoke.
“You’re a little troublemaker, aren’t you?” she asked, “I’m on to you, Stephanie…”
I remained silent and motionless. That was what I was best at, and Celeste sat down to work for the day. That signaled the start of my latest game… but for the first time in 70 years, I started to feel like I was losing, and I was okay with that!
Every time I moved spots when Celeste wasn’t looking, she seemed amused by it. She’d talk to me, as if she expected me to respond. I almost talked back… but there was something in me that told me not to. A strong memory of Melanie’s fear perhaps.
“What, you didn’t like the couch?” she teased, when I moved to another chair. When I moved again, she called me fussy. But she never put me back in my original spot. After a few nights of this, when she went to sleep, I climbed the stairs to sit in her living room. Celeste came down the next morning and stopped dead in her tracks, staring at me as I sat knowingly on the upstairs sofa, as if I owned the place.
“Well, well. I guess you’re just making yourself at home, then,” she said, and chuckled softly. She sat down on the sofa, and put me in her lap.
“I guess you were the one giving that cutie at the pawnshop all that trouble, huh? Well, don’t be too mean to me, alright? I’m not being mean to you!”
She spoke so casually that it puzzled me! She should’ve been afraid, like everyone else! I’d done almost everything short of walk and talk in front of her. But she took it all so calmly. It was like nothing else I’d ever seen.
“You’re the real deal, aren’t you?” she asked after a while. I didn’t move. I didn’t tell her the truth. I don’t know if I needed to. Celeste chuckled, and set me back down on the couch.
“Well. If you turn out to be evil. I’ll throw you off the roof. That’s your only warning, Steph.”
Steph. I liked that name.
I liked my owner.
I liked my new life.
As time continued to move on by, Celeste grew accustomed to my pranks. I wondered if there was any doubt in her mind as to what I was. If maybe she wondered if I was a prank, but if she did, she never said it. She rarely had guests, but when she did, she often introduced me. Not as a friend, but as a curiosity. I was fine with that. That was what I was after all. No point in hiding it. A few times, to my surprise, I even saw Shauna again.
The first time, she came down to record an episode of Celeste’s podcast with her, and she froze when she saw me on the sofa.
“Oh… You’ve still got Stephanie.”
“Yup! Don’t worry, she’s harmless!” Celeste assured her. “A bit of a prankster, but harmless!”
Shauna continued to stare, before drawing closer to me.
“So she’s not giving you too much trouble then?”
“Not at all! She’s great! I’m pretty sure she’s the real deal!”
Shauna didn’t look too happy to hear that, and quickly put some distance between us. Of course, the subject of the podcast that day was me. Celeste didn’t mention me often, but it seemed like she’d been waiting for Shauna to record that episode with her. Then of course, there was Mark.
My understanding of the situation was this. Mark was Celeste’s on again, off again boyfriend. I’d heard several over the phone arguments between them, and it was probably inevitable that he’d come back.
At first, I didn’t mind Mark. He smiled often, had short blonde hair and a beefy build. He had several piercings and tattoos. His early visits were timid, almost sweet encounters. Celeste seemed shy around him. But he never seemed threatening to me. He would stay by the door, and speak in a soft, crooning voice.
Then, he started coming inside more and more often. Celeste warmed to him. They laughed together. They watched movies in the basement together, cuddled close. Even their arguments usually ended in Celeste calling to apologize, and Mark coming back like nothing was wrong. Mark didn’t go down into Celeste’s basement often. On the rare occasion that they did watch a movie together, it was never horror. He didn’t like horror. He didn’t seem to like the basement much either. The first time he came down, he didn’t spend much time looking around.
“Same old shit, huh?” he asked, somewhat playfully, somewhat frustrated.
“Well, yeah, it’s my collection!” Celeste said shyly. “I couldn’t get rid of it! I mean, it took me a while to find all of this stuff!” Mark’s eyes settled on me.
“That’s new… What’s with the doll?”
“Oh, that’s Stephanie. Isn’t she cute? I found her at a little pawn shop a couple of months back.”
Mark kept his distance from me, but I could tell he didn’t approve.
“Y’know, you could probably spend your money a little more wisely.”
Celeste snorted.
“On what?”
Mark had no response for that, and just sighed, stepping away to avoid the now brewing argument.
“I dunno. Other stuff. Here, you gonna put a movie on or what?”
Celeste frowned, but did as he asked, letting him pick a military-themed action movie, just like he always did.
It took me a while to notice that their arguments became more and more frequent, and over smaller and smaller things. What time the dishes were washed, how much time Celeste had spent working on her podcast. Mark seemed to disapprove of it, and his disapproval resulted in less time put into working on it. Small things led to big outbursts until at last they culminated in a turning point.
I didn’t hear what started the argument. I’d only crept partially up the basement stairs to peek into the living room, when I heard the smack of skin on skin, and saw Celeste fall. She placed a hand on her cheek, and looked shocked. Mark stood over her, dead silent.
“I’m sorry,” he said curtly. “That was an accident… I’m sorry…” He reached down, helping Celeste up off the floor. “I lost my temper! I’m so, so sorry!”
No matter how many times he said it, it didn’t sound sincere. Celeste just rested a hand on her cheek and stared at him. I knew there was a lot going through her mind. Finally, she spoke.
“It’s… It’s fine, I’m fine…”
Her voice was small. Nervous. Mark took her hand away, looking at her cheek.
“I don’t think it’ll bruise… I’m sorry. Please don’t be mad. I’m sorry! I love you!”
No response from Celeste, she just calmly went to sit down, as if thinking things over. Neither of them saw me.
“Here… Let me make this up to you. I’m so sorry… I just… I lost control, and I hurt you! Oh, God… It won’t happen again, I swear!”
But, of course, it did happen again. And again after that, and after that. Never just a slap anymore. It turned into a punch. He’d throw her across the room. The apology wouldn’t always come afterwards now. In fact, the apologies tapered off. The basement became Celeste’s refuge. She would go down there to cry. Sometimes, she would hug me tight as she did, and with the gentlest of touches, I would hug her too.
Celeste’s work laptop sat untouched. She never seemed to go out anymore, or talk to her friends. Mark didn’t like her socializing with people when he wasn’t around. He didn’t like her working, where other men might talk to her. He even accused her of ‘camming’ whatever that was. In his rage, he called her such awful names. Names I will not repeat, and as this went on, as my Celeste suffered… I suffered. I suffered until I could not take it anymore.
I had been good around Mark. Firstly out of respect, but later out of fear. He’d never paid me any mind. I was just some of ‘Celeste’s shit’ that was crammed into her basement. It was a harsh label, but a useful one. It allowed me to do what I needed to do. With Celeste’s laptop untouched, I found myself drawn to it. Of course, I had used it before without her knowing. But this was different. Now I wasn’t doing it to learn. I was doing it to help. It took me a while to create my very own email. Navigating a keyboard with little ball-jointed fingers was not an easy task. But in the end, I did it.
I read through Celeste’s contacts, and I found Shauna. She and Celeste had emailed a bit, back and forth to set up her appearance on the podcast. It seemed like they’d struck up a bit of a friendship. That was good for my purposes. I had memorized Mark’s work schedule, so I knew when he would be out of the house, and I set up my meeting for then.
This is what I sent:
Hi, Shauna,
I’m a friend of Celeste’s, and lately, I’ve been very worried about her. I’m concerned for her health and wellbeing, and fear that she may be in a dire situation! I’m not sure if you’ve met Mark, her boyfriend. But I’ve seen that he has been mistreating her! Celeste never seems to leave the house. I see bruises on her face. I know he is hurting her. I know she is afraid to leave.
I don’t know how much support I can offer her, but I know that you might be able to help. I’m not sure who else to turn to. You’re the only one I know that I’ve seen her with. I need you to talk to her in person. Not over email or by phone. I think Mark is monitoring those. I’m afraid for her safety.
I almost signed my name, but I stopped myself. Shauna might not take an email from me seriously. So I left it anonymous. Maybe they might still figure out who it was. Part of me selfishly hoped they would, but it was a selfish want. I included Mark’s work schedule to give Shauna an idea of when Celeste would be alone, and then I waited.
Shauna came two days later, barely ten minutes after Mark had left for work. From the basement, I could hear the knock on the door, and Celeste’s wary footsteps as she went to answer. Hearing Shauna’s voice lifted my spirits immediately.
“Celeste! It’s good to see you!”
I left my spot on the sofa to slowly climb the stairs and watch. I made it to my usual vantage point just in time to see Shauna examining a very prominent bruise on Celeste’s cheek. Celeste avoided meeting her eyes.
“Jesus… He did this to you?”
“It’s nothing…” Celeste said softly, “I fell… It’s fine…”
“Well, whoever emailed me didn’t seem to think so!” Shauna argued, following Celeste as she tried to retreat into the kitchen, “I got an email the other day talking about how they were worried about you! You’re not leaving the house, you’ve got those bruises… and the podcast hasn’t been updated in weeks!”
“Mark’s taking care of me…” Celeste murmured under her breath, and Shauna grabbed her by the shoulders, turning her to look her in the eye.
“That’s a lie!” she said sternly. “Look… Obviously, something’s going on, and people are worried about you. For God’s sake, some stranger reached out to me! I was going to ignore it, but I started thinking… I haven’t seen you in months. I haven’t heard from you in weeks, and ever since Mark came back, you’re different!”
The tears in Celeste’s eyes confirmed what she knew to be true, and she began to break down, crashing into her friend’s arms to sob. If I had a heart, it would’ve been warmed.
Shauna hugged her, for a moment, unsure of what to say next.
“Shh… it’s okay… It’s alright. Let it out…” She seemed to hesitate for a moment, before speaking again. “Look, you can stay with me, if you want,” she said, “until you can find a way to kick him out of the house. Please, God, tell me he isn’t on the lease…”
“No… No, I didn’t…”
“Good. Look, we’ll get you home. We’ll take some pictures of those bruises. I’ll get the Cops on that bastard!”
I saw fear enter Celeste’s eyes, but she didn’t argue. If anything, I think she agreed.
“Here, just… pack your things,” Shauna said. “I’m taking you out of here. Now.” Celeste took a step back, nodding slowly, before pausing to ask.
“Who sent the email?” she asked. I started back down the stairs again, knowing what was coming, but I still heard it.
“Oh, one of your other friends. They didn’t sign their name and I didn’t recognize the email. Maybe someone saw us while we were out a few months back? I can’t remember… I sent a follow-up asking who it was, but they haven’t replied yet.”
I had forgotten to check to see if she had replied… but that could wait. Celeste’s eyes shifted over towards the basement stairs, and I ducked out of view, heading back to my original chair to sit pretty and perfect. Celeste said something, but I didn’t hear just what before the footsteps came down to join me. Celeste stepped into the basement, eyes immediately fixed on me. She stared at me, just like she always had.
“Stephanie?” she asked.
I didn’t answer. Celeste knelt down before me, staring into my eyes like she had countless times before. She was crying, and I could feel her fear. But it wasn’t of me.
“Let’s go pack…”
Celeste picked me up and carried me upstairs. I was the only thing she took from the basement. The only thing that mattered to her. Shauna stared at me uneasily as we passed her, but she made no comment. Together, my girl and I went upstairs to the bedroom. I’d never been there before. The queen-sized bed was unmade, and the large window that faced out onto the street was open. A pleasant breeze billowed past the white curtains. I was set down on the bed as Celeste took a gym bag from a closet, and began to stuff her things into it. No time to fold. She just wanted to leave… and I wanted to leave with her. If I could have smiled, I would have.
Then I heard it downstairs. The slam of the door, and Mark’s angry footsteps. He shouldn’t have been home! I’d timed it perfectly, and yet here he was… Had he come back? Had he seen something? Suspected something? Why? How!
“Who the fuck are you?” he snarled. “What gives you the right to come into my house?!”
“I’m sorry, I’m just a friend of Celeste’s!” Shauna protested. “I was just stopping by to check on her…”
“Yeah? And did that involve parking outside the house until I left?”
I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to be angry at Shauna for being noticed, or angry at Mark for being so paranoid that he’d noticed.
“Look, I wasn’t trying to-”
“Are you fucking that little dyke?” Mark snarled, and I could hear a struggle downstairs.
“ARE YOU FUCKING THAT LITTLE-”
“Get off me!”
I could hear Shauna slapping Mark, before Mark retaliated. I could hear as Shauna cried out in pain, before the sound of Mark’s booming footsteps ascending the stairs drowned everything else out. Celeste stood frozen in front of the bed, tears flowing freely down her cheeks. Her body trembled in fear as the Monster came for her. He stormed down the hall and through the bedroom door. He didn’t speak a word. He just threw a punch, right into Celeste’s face. She hit the ground with a strangled cry, and curled into a ball as Mark stood over her.
“What the fuck is this?” he growled, reaching down to pick her up. He pinned her against the wall beside the large window that looked out onto the street.
“You think you’re just gonna up and fucking leave me? DO YOU?”
Celeste choked out terrified apologies as Mark’s hands rested around her throat.
“Let me make this abundantly clear, okay? You are mine. You’re my girl, and we’re not done until one of us is in a fucking body bag, do you hear me?”
“Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”
The words tumbled uselessly from Celeste’s mouth, and were drowned out in her helpless gagging as his hands tightened around her frail little throat.
“Is that what you want, sweetheart? To be in a fucking body bag?”
Her feet no longer touched the floor… Her face was turning red. He was killing her! Whether he meant it or not, she was going to die! Fear no longer mattered to me.
“Stop it, now!” It was the first time I’d heard my own voice in years, and it caught his attention. Slowly, I stood up as Mark looked back at me. His grip on Celeste’s neck loosened. His eyes widened in terror. Celeste’s eyes focused on me, unblinking, but not afraid. Hopeful.
“Stay away from her! Don’t you dare touch her!”
Mark shrank back against the window, eyes fixated on me, before narrowing.
“J-Jesus fucking Christ… What are you?”
I didn’t answer, because I didn’t know. I just stood and stared.
“WHAT ARE YOU?!” he demanded again.
“I’m just a doll,” I replied, and took a step towards him, “but if you lay one more finger on her, I’ll hurt you.”
Mark remained still for a moment, and I hoped he’d run, just like everyone else had run. But I could already see his expression hardening as he realized I posed absolutely no threat to him. I had no supernatural powers, no weapons, no ghosts or demons at my disposal. It was just me. Maybe that would be enough. As Mark’s hands balled into a fist, as he prepared to strike me, there was only one thing I could do. I knew what would happen if I did it. But maybe, just maybe I could make a difference. Celeste looked at me with a silent look of wide-eyed awe, and now I looked back at her. Then I ran forwards.
I didn’t have much power. But it was enough. I launched myself into Mark’s chest, and felt his body slam against the windowsill. Then he tipped over it. Together we slid down the slope of the roof. I heard Mark screaming, and the last thing I saw was Celeste’s face in the window, as she screamed my name.
My body would shatter. I would die. But I was happy. Some people were worth shattering for. Mark would die with me. Celeste would be safe. I was happy as I hit the ground, and for the first time in my life, I slipped into Oblivion.
I called myself a doll, but sometimes I wonder. Dolls don’t feel love. Dolls don’t feel loneliness. Dolls don’t learn, and if my life was anything, it was a learning experience. Miserable, lonely and beautiful. But mine to study and enjoy. Am I just a doll? Even now, I do not know. Maybe I am more.
What I do know for certain is this… A little bit of glue goes a long way. I can still feel the cracks in my skin, even though you can barely see them, but they don’t bother me. They’re a daily reminder of what I did for the girl who loved me. Celeste is safe. She is happy, and Mark will never hurt her again. Today, she and Shauna are celebrating their one-year anniversary. Celeste has been planning this for some time. I hope it goes well.
I’ve always wanted a family."	9.95	21.0	Ryan Peacock	12/10/2021
The Self-Portrait of Rancorous Ruck	"It hasn’t even been a day since I first laid eyes upon it.
I was dropping my girlfriend off for her last in-person yoga class before everything went back on lockdown for the winter, when a portrait hanging in the display window of the shop across the street unexpectedly caught my attention.
It was an eighteen-inch by twenty-four-inch expressionist painting of a black humanoid creature with poorly defined edges and features, like it was bleeding into the shadows around it. It was tall, gaunt, and hunched, dressed in a tattered hood and mantle that vaguely resembled a set of wings. It lacked all facial features save for a pair of misty white eyes, the only part of its body that wasn’t black. It held a lumpy sack in one hand, and in the other, it plucked up a child between two of its long, Dr. Seussesque fingers.
The child was bruised and bloodied, and undeniably terrified for its life, but no motive could be inferred from the stance of its tormentor. The whole scene was reminiscent of Saturn devouring his children, only with Saturn reimagined as some sort of Lovecraftian boogieman.
My interest sufficiently peaked, I decided to go inside for a closer look.
The shop in question was Orville’s Old-Fashioned Oddity Outlet, and was mildly infamous for selling strange items of questionable authenticity. Ever since I had first started taking my girlfriend to the neighboring Eve’s Eden of Esoterica, I often found myself wondering how old Orville managed to stay in business. His oddity shop rarely seemed busy, and from what I could tell most people agreed that his merchandise was overpriced hokum.
It could have just been that Orville was living off an inheritance or something and was operating his business at a loss for the hell of it, or that the runoff from Eve’s was enough to keep him afloat. But, a quick glance at the local paranormal forum HarrowickHallows.net produced photographs of some of our town’s wealthiest residents visiting the shop, along with a handful of other mysterious figures who nobody recognized. Everything from cloaked cultists to colorful clown girls had been seen making after-hours visits to Orville’s. So maybe, just maybe, a few of Orville’s high-end items were legit, and the occasional sale to his select clientele was all he needed to stay in business.
It was a fun little thought as I stepped through the door, paying no heed to the large ‘Caveat Emptor’ emblazoned upon it.
“VHS tapes? What am I supposed to do with VHS tapes?” I heard a gruff voice ask. I turned towards it and saw an old man in a garish pastel suit with his feet up on his desk and a phone in his hand. With his other hand, he indicated he would be with me in one moment. “Nobody has a VCR anymore, so what good would – You have a VCR to go with the tape collection? And what’s its deal? Of course you can’t set the clock, there’s nothing paranormal about that! Listen, what are you trying to sell, the tapes or what’s on the tapes? Because if it’s what’s on the tapes then maybe you could – uh-huh. Well, I’ll never be able to move them as a general item if I have to convince people to buy an obsolete VCR to go with them. I might be able to broker a deal with a specific buyer, but I’ll need more information. Not now though, I’ve got a customer. I’ll call you back. I – I said – no, if you put a piece of scotch tape over the removed tab you can tape over it again. If there’s tape residue then they could have been taped over, but it could just be from an old label, how would I know? I – yeah, you figure that out. I got to go. Bye.”
He hung up the receiver on the cradle of a bronze and mahogany rotary phone before folding his fingers and giving me his full attention.
“Honestly, the things some of these jerks try to unload on me,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “Anywho, can I help you find anything, young man?”
“Yeah, actually. I was wondering about that painting in the window,” I replied, pointing to the display behind me.
“Oh, you mean The Self-Portrait of Rancorous Ruck,” the old man flashed me a devious smile before donning an iridescent tragedy mask with a surgical mask fixed to the inside.
“Self-portrait?” I asked skeptically.
“Absolutely,” he said, rising from his seat and leading me towards the painting. “Cryptids and monsters are notoriously difficult to get decent photographs of, and that was a bit of a problem for Old Rancor here. He can’t exist in the real world unless he already exists in the mind of a… suitable host, let’s say. He’s sustained by thoughts about him and uses his host’s innate mental energy to manifest a physical form for himself. This presents a bit of a Catch-22, since he needs people to know about him to exist, but existing is kind of a prerequisite for people to know about you. What’s a damned thoughtform to do? If you’re a thought-based murder monster with an artistic streak like Rancorous Ruck here, you leave a self-portrait behind as a calling card. That way, even after your host is pushing up daisies, another one is bound to come along sooner or later and end up getting you stuck in their head.”
He took the portrait down from the easel and allowed me to get a better look at it, taking care not to look at it himself.
The first thing I noticed was that the lumps of the sack were much more clearly hands or feet or faces pushing against it from the inside. The bottom of the sack was wet and dripping with a dark fluid, presumably blood, and the background showed many small sets of footprints running rapidly in all directions.
Finally, in the corner, I could make the signature of the artist in the same stark white as the creature’s eyes; Rancorous Ruck, Self-Portrait Sept. 1947.
“So, you’re claiming that the creature in the portrait is the artist, and it leaves these paintings behind as a way to infect other victims?” I asked incredulously.
“That’s right, and anyone with a lick of sense or concern for their fellow human beings burns ’em, so they’re very rare,” Orville replied. “I know what you’re thinking; why in the world would anyone pay thirteen hundred dollars for a cursed painting?”
“Thirteen hundred!”
“Before taxes and various fees and surcharges, yes. The reason is that since Old Rancor is sustained by your thoughts, you’re able to exert some control over how he manifests. The more you study this portrait, the more of Rancorous you take into yourself, and – if you’re strong enough – the more of him you can bend to your will. Potentially very useful; or, you know, life-saving, if he decides to come after you. Which he probably will, since you’ve taken such an interest in his handiwork. Good luck getting him out of your head now. Seriously though, your best bet is to buy the painting and study every square inch of it until your eyes are bloodshot, put in some eye drops, and keep studying.”
I was more than a little confused by Orville’s sales pitch of ‘buy this possessed painting in the hopes of inoculating yourself against the demon first’. I didn’t really believe him, but I did find the story mildly entertaining.
As for the painting itself, I genuinely liked it. It was delightfully macabre, and I was curious about why the artist would have titled it a self-portrait. I could tell that it was an actual painting and not a print, so even though I would have liked some actual provenance on the piece, thirteen hundred wasn’t an outrageous asking price for a decent work by an unknown artist.
As much as I hate myself for it, I ended up buying the damn thing, which came to almost sixteen hundred with all of Orville’s taxes, fees, and surcharges. He wrapped it up very carefully, still taking the greatest of care not to look at it himself, and helped me Tetris it into the trunk of my car. I didn’t want my girlfriend to see it; not because I was afraid of the curse, but because I was afraid of her cursing me out. Fortunately, when she came out of Eve’s, she put her bags in the backseat instead of the trunk. I didn’t really have a plan for what I would have said if she had opened the trunk, but I got lucky. That was a fight we could save for another day.
Once I had taken her home and gotten back to my own apartment, for some reason I took Orville’s advice and carefully inspected the painting before hanging it up. It didn’t make any sense though, since there wasn’t really anything to study. Rancorous Ruck was just a shadow person, and there didn’t seem much more I could learn just by looking at him. If I squinted, I thought that maybe I could make out the outline of a belt, ragged sleeves or the tattered hem of his hood, but that was it. I stared into the empty void of his face, thinking that if there was any hidden detail that was where I’d find it, but no matter how hard I looked I couldn’t see anything other than those two white eyes.
Since my thorough examination of the piece failed to yield any hidden secrets, I felt comfortably reassured that Orville had been full of crap. I even googled ‘Rancorous Ruck’, and got zero results, which seemed a crushing blow to Orville’s claim that there had ever been multiple paintings by an artist using that pseudonym. I was convinced the painting was a one-off by an unknown artist that had somehow found its way to Orville’s shop, and he made up a story to go with it as he did for all his wares.
I did vaguely recall seeing something about a Red Ruck on the Harrowick Hallows forum, but I didn’t think too much of it. I figured both were just drawing inspiration from the same local legend. I tried taking a photo of the portrait with my phone to upload to the forum, and that’s when things first started to get weird.
When I looked at the portrait through my phone, Ruck was nothing but an amorphous black cloud. There was nothing humanoid about his form at all, and the white bits that had been his eyes were now clearly just breaks in the cloud. I fiddled around with the settings and even the lighting in my room, but nothing could make Rancorous Ruck appear on the screen the way he did in the portrait.
This got even more unsettling when I tried to take a photo or record a video. Each and every time, the file wouldn’t save, no matter what I did. I tried saving it to the device, the SD card, the cloud; nothing worked.
At this point, I was starting to get a little freaked out, but there were still rational explanations to explore before accepting Orville’s cockamamie story. Like, maybe the portrait wasn’t from 1947 at all but was far more modern, and embedded with some machine-readable code for digital rights management. But that wasn’t really how something like that would work, was it? I would get a notification telling me I didn’t have the rights to share the image. It wouldn’t just inexplicably be unable to save files, and it certainly wouldn’t automatically censor it the way it was doing. Could it have been for a joke or marketing scheme then? But that still would have required getting the software onto my phone somehow. Maybe my phone was infected with malware and it was just a coincidence that the first thing I tried to take a photo of was this creepy painting.
That was pretty much all I could think of, aside from the obvious theories about losing my marbles. Frustrated, I tossed my phone aside and leaned in to examine the portrait once again, to see if I could find anything that might explain the incongruity between what I was seeing and what the camera on my phone saw.
I found myself staring into Ruck’s eyes, the eyes that my phone said were nothing more than empty spaces in a shapeless black form. But they were too deliberately placed and shaped to be anything but eyes, and they had been painted a very distinct white to contrast with the darkness around them, making their presence undeniable. I could even make out the faint outline of pupils and irises, though I hadn’t noticed them before. In fact, now that I was really looking at them, I could see that they even had corneas, each of which held the reflection of a vague, ghostly figure.
It was astonishing, actually, how much detail had gone into eyes that would only be noticed up close.
By then I was really starting to wish that my girlfriend had discovered the painting. At least then I’d have a rational excuse to take it back to Orville’s. Not that he would have taken it back. He was very clear that the only thing about his shop that wasn’t real was his return policy.
I tried to convince myself that I was being silly. The whole reason I bought the painting was because it was creepy, and if I had spent as much money on my phone as I had on it maybe it would be able to take a decent picture of it. Sighing in defeat, I resigned myself to living with the portrait for at least one night. If it was still a problem in the light of day, I’d try to pawn it off on some gallery or museum for a tax deduction.
Sleep, unsurprisingly, eluded me that night. Have you heard of the Tetris Effect? It’s when you have residual imagery of something you were really focused on, either in the dark or in your peripheral vision.
Well, as I laid in the dark that night, I could see Rancorous Ruck. At first, it was just his eyes floating in the darkness, his body as amorphous as it had been on my phone. But, gradually, he started to take shape. His head, his hood, and his mantle, then his limbs, his torso, and finally his sack all slowly emerged as distinct from the surrounding darkness, and I could see him as clearly as if I was looking at his portrait. The child, however, did not appear, leaving Ruck with a free hand. He held up his long fingers to his face to examine them, and I thought nothing of it, dismissing it as more hypnagogic imagery.
Then he lowered his hands and looked towards me, and a smile made of nothing more than a bright white line broke out across his face.
He set his sack on the ground and began noisily rummaging through it, and as I drifted off to sleep, I remember thinking that it was very odd that a residual image on my retina should be able to make any noise at all.
It was still night when I awoke again, still dark, but I could immediately tell something was wrong. My bedroom door was open when I knew I had closed it, and light was leaking in through the crack when I knew I had turned all the lights off.
Panicking, I bolted out of bed and dashed into the living room, ready to confront any intruders with only my bare fists.
My machismo vanished pretty quickly when I saw what was waiting for me in that room.
In the sepia light of candles that I didn’t own, I saw the hunched figure of Rancorous Ruck working ardently at another self-portrait. His back was turned to me, and thus the painting was facing my direction. He had drawn himself emerging out of an inky black patch of mold on an old brick wall, wrapping his hand around the mouth of his victim while brandishing a knife in the other. Even though his victim’s face was mostly covered by his hand, there wasn’t the slightest doubt in my mind that it was supposed to be me.
He turned around to face me then, his face nothing more than two white dots and a smile against an impenetrable black void. He held up his brush, heavy with paint that he carelessly let drip to my floor, and moved slightly to the side so that I could get a better view of his artwork.
“I don’t think I got your eyes quite right, boy,” he mocked in a raspy voice. “Hope you can live with that.”
I didn’t respond. Hell, I barely heard him, my heart was pounding so hard. My veins were flooded with adrenaline but I couldn’t will my limbs to move. I was practically catatonic, sweating and shivering as I just stared wide-eyed at the monster painting in my living room.
Ruck just snickered in contempt, turning his attention back to his painting, adding a few finishing touches.
Only then, when his back was turned and I thought I actually had a chance, did I run. I ran to my apartment door and threw it open, only to see Old Rancor casually standing in the doorframe, blocking my path.
“Hello,” he smirked, with an exaggerated wave of his long, mangey fingers. “Yes, Dr. Seussesque is what you called them, if I’m not mistaken. A colorful description, I must admit, even if it’s not exactly what I was going for.”
I slammed the door shut, but it just went right through him, and he had somehow moved up slightly so that I had just shut him into the apartment with me.
I had two choices then, either to fight him head-on or try to reach the fire escape. For absolutely nothing remotely resembling a rational motive, I tried to throttle him and tackle him to the ground. Before I could even make contact though, he slipped behind me with an ethereal ease and leapt upon my back, putting me into a chokehold and muffling my screams with his hand. I frantically tried to buck him off, slamming up against the wall and rolling upon the floor, but he clung to me with a dauntless and uncanny tenacity.
It didn’t take long for me to exhaust my oxygen supply like that, and I quickly lost consciousness.
I wasn’t dead though, not yet. I awoke at my desk, tied to my chair, with my laptop booted up and placed in front of me. It was still night, and I probably wasn’t out for more than a few minutes. I began frantically looking around for my attacker, and sure enough, he was standing over me with his arms crossed, waiting patiently for me to wake up.
“What the fuck are you?” I demanded, struggling against my bindings whilst on the verge of hyperventilation.
“Exactly what Orville told you, or at least close enough that it’s not worth going over again,” he replied. He bent over and picked up his soggy, dripping sack, and I could see slowly writhing faces, hands, and other body parts pushing against it from the inside, moaning in dull anguish as they thrashed within their burlap prison. “See this? In here are all the minds of my old victims, and they’re what keeps me going when the world forgets about me. You’re going in here too, but not just yet. I have a small favor to ask of you first.”
“Fuck you!” I cursed, vehemently spitting at him. He backhanded me so hard my chair toppled over. I was too out of it for a second to notice him putting me back up, but apparently, he did, because when I came back to my senses I was looking at my computer again.
“Orville was right, you know. Your thoughts sustain me, so all you had to do to beat me was not think of me as a monster,” he taunted me, his smile twisting into a jagged white scrawl of chalk as he squeezed my cheeks with his prickly, slimy fingers. “A shame that’s easier said than done. You have managed to make one non-trivial contribution to my being though, aside from the Seuss fingers. You couldn’t find a single search result when you googled me, and in this day and age, one needs an online presence if one hopes to get anywhere.
“So here’s the deal; I’m going to paint, and you’re going to write, and if you come up with something postable by the time I’ve finished my painting, you’ll get the privilege of going into my sack in one piece. But if you refuse…”
He held his sack up to my face and pulled it open. Inside was an endless abyss of severed limbs, flayed skins, decapitated heads and scalped faces, all of them still animate and aware.
Worst of all, most of them looked like they had come from children.
He snapped the bag shut again, and I tried to muster up the courage to tell him to fuck off again – but I couldn’t.
And so, I’m writing this; Rancorous Ruck’s debut post to the interwebs, exposing him to a bigger audience than his paintings ever could.
I don’t know if something written by someone else will infect people the same way as his paintings do, but I really hope they don’t. But, if this post does infect people, please know that I’m truly sorry. The bastard’s in my head now, I’m not strong enough to resist him. Once I post this, I’m going in the sack, and maybe you think that’s what I deserve for giving into Rancor’s demands.
But if you pity me at all, and you ever happen to be in Sombermorey, then please, please, do me one favor; burn Orville’s shop to the ground."	10.0	12.0	The Vesper's Bell	11/12/2021
The Wizard King	"“I need to see the Wizard King,” I told the wraith who guarded the King’s tower.
The entity observed me, standing motionless near the door it guarded.  The human elements were wrapped in gray cloth that seemed to sway as though floating in water, tugged at by ethereal currents that I could neither feel nor see.  Places where ‘flesh’ was exposed showed a body that had been eaten away by attrition.  Bone shone through its decayed face and arms.  The hollow eyes bored into me, cutting as deep as any blade ever could.  Creatures such as these, tarnished souls forced back into physical form, could kill with a touch if they desired.  Their hollow eyes were known to freeze men in place.  I could feel that weight upon me.
“Entering the tower is death.  You should return from whence you came.”  Its voice was a tear between our world and the next, a harsh whisper spoken across a chasm not meant to be spanned.
I reached into the pouch at my side, fingers dancing over the wooden figurine I’d brought with me.  I pulled it from my pocket and held the damned scrap of wood out in front of the wraith.  It was a simple carving in the shape of a person.
“I know why you’re here, mortal, but I also know that no one reaches the King’s roost.  You waste your life.”  There was no judgment in that voice, just an eternal melancholy that would never find solace.
“I’m going in,” I stated flatly, unwilling to be turned aside.
It considered me for a moment, as though trying to decide what sort of audacious creature stood before it, and whether or not it should try to put a stop to my entry of the tower.
“So be it.”  The wraith finally said. It lifted a hand, inviting me to take it, and I joined my warm flesh to its cold decay.  The pain was immediate, a fire starting in my palm and sending shockwaves of agony through me.  This was the curse of burning, the price of tower entry.
The door behind the wraith opened and the undead creature stood aside.  I looked at my palm where a smoldering dot was burning with an unnatural intensity.  My time was now falling away like sand through an hourglass.  I stepped into the dark.
The door shut heavily behind me, the hidden lock engaging.  No one could leave that way, but I hadn’t come expecting to turn back.  The smell of decay wrapped around me, death an odor as familiar as the touch of a passing breeze.  The dark sought to hold me firm, but I knew it too well.
“Another comes.” A voice whispered through the darkness.
“Another fool comes.” Another voice said almost on top of the first.  It was followed by mocking laughter.
“Come then, succulent one.  Come feed us.”  Whether it was the first or second thing that said this I couldn’t tell, but I knew what they were.  I had met their like before.  I reached into my belt and pulled out a small, wax-wrapped stick.  A moment later I twisted the seal atop the bundle and it burst to life, a dazzling fire that cast back the shadows of the room I was in.  Frost fire flares could burn for hours, and I’d been certain to bring several with me.
Four creatures filled the otherwise empty first floor of the tower.  They were the size of small adults, bipedal, with feet that ended in splayed claws.  Gray skin marked them as creatures that were not accustomed to the sun. Their arms were proportional to their size, but their hands were large, ending in razors made for rending flesh.  They had large, long heads, most of the front of them taken up by a mouth that seemed to imply the main purpose of their existence was consuming flesh.  This was true.  They were yattering, abyssal predators that lived to feed.
They could only exist in our world when held in place by powerful curse magic.  Each one required the life of an innocent to be torn from the abyss.  These four represented four lives stolen, and that wasn’t including the human remains that lined the floor and walls of the chamber I was in.  Shreds of armored men in varying states of decomposition were all around, though most of the skeletons had been gnawed to the barest scraps.
The yattering hissed as the light splashed through the room.
“It brings light!” One creature whispered, its mouth not moving.  Yattering spoke their vile words directly into your mind.
“Kill it!”  Another growled into the recesses of my brain.
There were echoing sentiments from the others, but I didn’t wait for them to get through their distress about the light.  I pulled the war axe from my back and launched myself into the creatures.  The burning in my palm was getting worse, reminding me that I only had a limited time to do what I needed to do, and this was just the first floor.
Blood, guts, broken bone.  Sending a yattering back to the abyss wasn’t easy.  Sending a pack of four back was almost impossible since the moving ones could reassemble those that had been broken.  When I finally finished I was breathing hard, standing in the midst of a great circle of blood and guts.  The heads were off in one corner, the rest of them as far in the other direction as I could get them.  The bodies still twitched and moved, but not with enough intelligence to do anything meaningful.
The first floor was done.  I had nine more to climb.  I grabbed my burning brand and started upwards.  The stairs were stone, like the walls, like the ceiling, like every piece of this place.  It was less a tower home, and more like a tower prison, each floor designed to hold some magical horror, another guardian for the man at the top.
On the second floor, I dispatched a succubus and incubus pair.
On the third floor, I met a pack of necrowolves, and had to stop long enough to burn the bodies of the beasts lest they rise again and track me up the tower.  Unlike the yattering, they could regenerate on their own without the need to recover their pieces.
On the fifth floor, I was forced to face and fight a dozen children of the forest cannibals.  Elves, once, but now mad, driven that way by the corruption of the elder forest gods.  I dispatched them all, but not before they took the pinky from my burning hand, and bit off a chunk of my leather armor.  They were not immortal, and they were starved, so the fight was easy but for the numbers, and the toll it took on my conscience.  Even as dark and jaded as I had become, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I was dispatching children.
 
On the sixth floor, I met an old man by a fire that had been set in a hearth, the closest thing to furniture that I’d seen so far.  He sat upon the floor, tucked inside of a battered blanket.  My marked hand was all but useless, the burning spot having consumed much of my palm, and rendered my fingers to ashes.
“You’ve come far.  No mortal has ever come to my hearth before, but you have four more floors ahead of you, and you’re short a hand.  Are you sure you wish to go further?  You could come and sit by my fire, and I would soothe your pain and let you go free of this place.”  His voice was dry and raspy, world-worn and tired.
“I’m passing through here,”  I said firmly, lifting my axe in my good hand.
“You know what that means, right?  To move past me, you must kill me.  The next floor only opens once you have finished the challenges of the current.  Are you so determined that you would kill a man who has done you no harm?”  He hunched forward, as though unable to keep himself sitting fully upright.
“I would,”  I told him.  “But we both know you are not harmless, nor are you a man, though you’ve fit yourself into one here.”
The old man tilted his head at me.  “I’m not certain I see your meaning?  If not a man, then what do you think I am?”
My memories shifted back to comfortable times, in a house where I bore no responsibility.  My mother baked away the shadows, and my father filled the evenings with stories.  Now I respun one of those stories.  “Back when my father was a young man, there were fairy creatures who stole into the houses of children at night.  The fairies sent the children fond dreams, and in exchange took from them loose teeth.  They left a copper coin on every pillow as a marker of their passing, but they did the children no harm, and their service was appreciated.”
“Oh, I think I know this story.  Go on.” Said the old man.
“When the gods of the forest went mad, their pollution took hold of all fae creatures, including these kindly fairies.  What happens when a tooth fairy goes mad with curse?”  I asked, shifting my axe up to my shoulder.
“What indeed?”  The man asked, tilting his head to the side.  His skin seemed to slide across his face, distorting his features.
“My father called them skull fairies, but I’ve heard them called other things since. Changelings.  Skin Thieves, Butcher Fairies.”  I shrugged.  “Many names, same basic monster.  Loves to kill its food, rip off the outer layer, and then wear it around.”
The old man stood up, and up, and up.  His head scraped the ceiling, the human flesh ripping on the stone ceiling.   Flesh and clothing tore away as the blanket fell from its shoulders, and it removed the pretense of humanity.  “You should have come to the fire.  You would have died faster.”  The chittering thing that had been in the old man was insect-like, but narrow and tall.  Its body was covered in limbs as long as arms that had been tucked and folded away.  The curse had twisted its fairy body into something monstrous.
By the time the last scrap of flesh was falling away, I already had the first swing of my axe launched.  The blade clove into a section of its torso, causing it to rear back and scream.  I continued the force of the blow and swung the axe back up to hit the monster in the face.  I cut deep, but I didn’t stop there.  Its arms were slashing at the air with unnatural strength.  I struck again and again as it tried to pierce the armor I was wearing.  It tried to fall atop me, but I dropped my axe and punched through one of the gouges I’d made in its flesh, reaching the creature’s black heart and crushing it.  It convulsed and then collapsed heavily atop me.
I rolled the corpse off of me and staggered to my feet.  Below my wrist on the burning side, all of my hand was blackened flesh wrapped around charred bone.
“Four more,”  I growled, recovering my axe. My voice was ragged with pain.
On floor seven I killed a plague gryphon, while dislocating my bad shoulder and shredding most of the backplate of my armor.
On floor eight I fought a pair of undead knights, bearing the sigil of the lord of the damned, and when I finally removed the head of the final fell thing, I tossed it to the ground and crushed it beneath my boot.  Their swords, edged in curse magic, rotted the leather from my armor straps, and left rust on my axe.
Then, on floor nine, I came to the final boundary.  It was the door itself that stood in my way.  The imposing portal was made of ancient wood, carved from frame to frame in a mural depicting the fall of the ancient city of Kavris to the hordes of the Hungry Queen.  Millions died, becoming meat for the demonic legion, and fueling the cursed magic of their fell matriarch.
This door was a thing I had never seen before.  I approached it cautiously.  The seam between the two panels was difficult to make out in the intricate carving.  There were no handles or obvious points to hold.  I hefted my axe and swung it with all my might at the place where the doors should split, and the blade hit as though striking an anvil.  The reverberation numbed my fingers and caused me to stagger backwards a step.  Raw force wasn’t going to work.
I dropped my axe to the ground and stepped towards the door again.  I was still for a moment, closing my eyes and becoming still.   I could feel the shifting of the air near the door, the crackle of magic that poisoned the world through its existence.  I could smell the rancid corruption of dark magic.  This door was more than just a door.  I carefully reached out my good hand and touched the wood.  It was cold, and a feeling of revulsion washed through me.  I grit my teeth and pushed against the door with my hand.
The world around me vanished, and suddenly I was standing amidst a city being devoured.  I could smell the char of burning bodies, and hear the screams of those who’d expected their walls to keep them safe.  I was lost in the horror of a memory made real, and then I knew what the door was.  It was an artifact of Kavris, some ancient wood salvaged from the fallen city and repurposed into the final portal.  Dark magic had been performed to draw the horrors of the city’s final moments into the wood and lock it in place, creating an object that could ensnare those foolish enough to touch it without an understanding of its nature.
Most would be lost in the illusion, doomed to stand in place and suffer the horror of the fall of Kavris over and over again until they finally succumbed to thirst, or perhaps some denizen of the tower.  I knew these traps for what they were.  My mind was trapped, but my body knew the way to freedom.  On instinct alone it pushed forward, breaking the seal on the door and stepping through the last boundary between me and the Wizard King.
As I passed the door frame, the vision of the city fled.  I walked up the last stairs and came up into a large room, one impossibly sized to fit atop the tower.  This was a hollow space, I knew immediately, a magic realm created by the will of the Wizard.  The whole tower was a part of this, but this floor was the one where the magic was strongest.  This place was a threat unto itself.  The size of it was a testament to the power of the being who controlled the space.
“No one has made it here before.”  A voice spoke to one side, and I turned to face it.  I’d seen wizards before, though none so strong as this one.  They were always unsettling creatures.  They began as human mages, magic users who pursued the arcane in an effort to help their fellows, but some of those mages lost sight of their goals and became hungry for more and more power.
A human body can only contain so much arcane magic.  Most of the greater magics were tainted by the curse, and tapping into them meant surviving a constant struggle with corruption.  Wizards, though, had discovered a way around this limitation.  If a human body was weak, then why restrict yourself to flesh?  The first step in going from mage to Wizard was the shedding of the human prison.
The Wizard that spoke to me now was one of the most horrifying examples of that shedding I’d yet encountered.  Many sought to make their new forms look somewhat like the one they were leaving behind; this Wizard had clearly not cared.
Its head was a wedge of rusted metal with articulated jaws crammed full of jagged metal teeth.  This wedge sat atop a bipedal frame with long metal arms that ended in three-fingered hands, all of it articulated with more joints than any living creature I’d seen before.  It could move these limbs in impossible directions.  Some parts of it were wood, most were metal, but there were chunks of bone in places as well, and I was aware that there were stretched sheets of human flesh covering parts to its chest and legs, leather accents to the rest of its horror.  Inside that frame would be a human heart and brain, though tucked deep inside in places no weapon could penetrate.
“You survived the climb, mortal.  I will grant you one boon, as is the law of the tower.”  I knew it could see me, though it had no eyes that I was aware of.
I took a step forward, reaching into my pocket to pull out the wooden figurine.  I tossed it to the ground at the Wizard King’s feet.
One of its arms stretched to the ground, bending and writhing down to pick up the figure.  It picked up the piece of wood, rolling it over in its three-fingered appendage.  “This should have been turned in to your village elders.  It would have gotten you a large sum of coin.”  Its voice was metallic, as though rolling up from the inside of a suit of armor.  It dropped the figure, then stepped forward and crushed it under a tri-toed metal foot.  “Yet you return your blessing to the one that gave it to you.  Do you seek to offend me?”
“Give me back my daughter.”  The fire of my anger burned deep and hot.
“Her life was paid for,” the King answered quickly.
“I never agreed to this.  Give her back.”  I growled the words back at the monster.
“You live within my domain, mortal.  That is all the agreement that is needed.  The protection of my magic has a cost.  I am benevolent, and in exchange for what I require, I leave you with a significant sum of coin.  This is how it has always been.  If you did not like the laws of my land, perhaps you should have lived elsewhere.”  It stood up taller, towering a full foot and a half over me.
I had known the Wizard King’s lands worked this way.  Even when I’d settled in them ten years earlier I had known this risk existed, but like a fool I’d assumed that this creature would never come for my family.  I had allowed for this evil to thrive and taken no action against it because this problem had not been mine, and now I paid for that.
“I have earned my boon,” I spoke firmly. “Give me back my daughter.”
“Your daughter is long dead.  Would you have her back as a wraith?  Perhaps I should drag her essence from beyond the veil and string it to a corpse.  Is that what you want?”  He laughed.  “I am a fair man.  Make a reasonable request and I will grant it.  Perhaps you would like the curse of burning removed from you?”  He glanced at my shoulder that was smoldering, my arm mostly burned away now.
I barely noticed his words.  A deep pit had opened up inside of me, a darkness of pain and rage so deep that I felt it consuming me.  I reached up and unfastened what remained of my chest plate.  I wanted to collapse and scream, to roar my despair to the sky.  The image of the last time I’d seen my daughter playing in the garden danced through my head, her smile like a dagger in my stomach, twisting.
“Well, what is it you want?” it asked.
As my chest plate hit the floor I reached up and grabbed the pendant on my neck.  “My father once told me that a man who will not stand up to evil because it does not yet touch him, is a man who does not deserve to keep that which he loves.  He was right.  It’s easy to forget the voices of those that came before when you just want to live in peace.”
“You are trying my patience.  What is it you want?”  It snapped its metal jaws at me.
“I want you to listen,” I told it.  “I want you to understand what you have done, and what is going to happen now.”
The Wizard King sighed and stepped back, slumping into a chair at a desk.  “Then speak.  Tell me what you think is going to happen.”
“My father was a man of many stories, and all of them built upon his journey through life.  Stories, legends, these are the cornerstones of what makes us who we are.  All families have stories they pass on, mine more than most I think.”  My voice I kept calm, but inside I was a broken ball of chaos, filled with an insurmountable rage.  I undead my pauldron on my ruined left arm and shrugged it to the floor with a grunt.
“You see, by the time I was growing up, most of my father’s people were already gone.  Even my mother was dead.  He couldn’t stress how important it was that I learn the tales of my people, that I understand what it meant to be a man of my lineage.  There was a responsibility that came with who we were.”
I pulled hard and snapped the necklace from around my neck.  It was a small vial that I always kept with me. I popped out the cork and drank the foul-tasting liquid inside of it.  Immediately I could feel it ravaging the insides of my body, peeling back the work of the serums I’d taken to make myself normal, to allow me to live as a human.
“Where is this going?” The creature before me asked, suspicion creeping into its voice.  “What are you doing?”
Magic crackled in the room, its scent heavy on the air, and I felt the pressure of cursed energy wrapping around my good arm, and around my legs as a maddened smile split my face.  The bones in my spine began to pop as the muscle along my spine expanded and stretched, and the vertebrae began to expand.  The pain was excruciating as I became taller.
“I should have come for you when you first came into my lands.”  My voice was a growl, deepening as my jaws began to snap and pop, the human skin on my face tearing.
“Werewolf!”  The King cursed, standing up and pulling his power to him.  Glyphs lit up on the ground, circles of protection sending pale green light up into the room.  “I watch for your kind! How did you get past wraith!?  It will not let your filth into the tower!”
My good arm snapped and stretched, my fingers turning into talons as the arm on the other side of my body ripped from the burned-off stump, quenching the spell fire that had been burning in the empty socket.
I laughed darkly.  “We were once werewolves, but that was long, long ago.  We have grown beyond those bounds.”  I roared with the last of my human voice.  I stepped through the bounding circle around me, the spell’s light flickering out as I stepped through it.
“No!”  The Wizard King yelled as he realized what I was.  Werewolves were resistant to magic, but I wasn’t a werewolf.  My kind had come from werewolves, bred for power and strength against our will until we broke free of our human keepers. Despite our treatment, we turned on the darkness and joined humanity in quenching the curse-borne demons of our world.  We were the war cult, and very few of us still remained.
I walked across the distance between myself and Wizard King as he backed away, pulling his dark magic to him.  Undead things began to rise from wells of light around him, but I broke them to pieces as they got in my path.  One shoved an old sword into my side, but the blade barely penetrated and I batted the creature away, closing the distance to my prey even further.
“Stop!”  He commanded in a roaring voice.  “I can give you your daughter back!”
Lies.  I’d known she was gone when I left my home.  I’d known she was dead when I passed the wraith.  This trip had never really been about getting her back, as badly as I wanted exactly that.  This was about revenge.  This was about doing what I should have done years before.  I’d tried so hard to forget the words of my father, to forget the part of me that was born for war, but creatures like me never really escaped.  We fought until we died, and loving anyone was always dangerous for that person.  It had been true for my wife, and now my daughter was gone, and fate had reminded me that none of us ever got away.
The Wizard threw fire and lightning, cursed me, and tried to bind me to the ground, but I shrugged off the magic.  Finally I reached him and then I rent him asunder, pulling his mechanical pieces apart and crushing them into rubble before I grabbed his metal skull and folded it between my clawed hands.  The crush of the soft flesh within ended the struggling, and quieted the magic of the tower.  I dropped the few pieces of the wizard that remained and turned to watch this magically created realm fall to shreds until none of the room I’d been in remained.
I stood in a bare tower, holes broken in the walls.  The whole structure seemed to sway lightly in the breeze.  The only evidence that remained of my fight, was the broken body of the Wizard King.  I threw back my head and howled at the emptiness that clung to me.  I howled for my daughter, and for the life I’d tried to have.
It was done, and I was alone and empty."	10.0	23.0	Craig Groshek	08/28/2021
Together Forever	"Last week I was alone in my bed. I’m not alone tonight. He’s right next to me. He’s not supposed to be here, though.
Last week I was a senior in high school and completely in love with Steven Hooverson. Truth be told, I’ve been in love with Steven for years. He was always handsome and popular.
I’ve never been popular.
I was an only child, and my mom spent the majority of her time bouncing from one man’s bed to another, usually in a meth-fueled haze. I was often alone for days in our dilapidated trailer. We didn’t even have pets; we couldn’t afford them. Besides, there were always strays running around the trailer park. A few times I would drag in some mange-riddled puppy or scrawny kitten and when my mother finally noticed, she would yell about having another mouth to feed
before tossing the animal out the door.
As I got older, I would hide the puppy or kitten for a few days. Before my mom could find them, I would smother them under a pillow or drown them in the bathtub. I buried their little bodies
under the trailer, that way I could visit the small mounds of dirt if I was feeling particularly lonely.
I was alone at school too, of course. You wouldn’t think someone could be lonely surrounded by a classroom full of people your own age, but you’d be wrong. Children have a special way of making someone like me miserable. My clothes were usually dirty or tattered, my hair hanging in greasy strings around my face. It’s hard to keep up appearances with donated clothes you couldn’t even keep clean because the water was often shut off. My classmates would tease me, call me “smelly” and “that grubby girl” and avoid me. Their whispers and giggles trailed after me, as close and familiar as my own shadow.
High school kids can be especially cruel. Boys would pretend to flirt with me on a dare. If I ever gave the slightest hint I believed their compliments, they would burst into laughter, running back to their group of friends waiting a few feet away, all of them pointing and doubled over, laughing. I hated the stupid sound of their hyena yapping. I learned to keep to myself and avoid talking to anyone. Most of the time everyone acted like I was invisible.
The only good thing about being invisible was being able to watch Steven. When he passed by me in the hallways, I could smell his body wash. My eyes would trail after him, drinking in every detail of the way he moved, how his clothes hugged his muscular body, his brilliant smile. Just being near him felt like standing warm sunshine after weeks of winter cold. In class I would watch him rub the back of his head when a test question was frustrating. My fingers would twitch on my desk, aching to run my fingers through his hair.
Last week I was tired of being alone. The twenty-seven dirt mounds under the trailer were not enough. I wanted to be with a person. I wanted Steven.
It was the week before Valentine’s Day. I watched stupid girls giggling as they passed pink cards out to their idiot friends. I watched boyfriends surprise their girlfriends with the standard boring boxes of candy. Even the damn teachers would find gifts on their desks.
On Thursday, February 12th, I decided I wouldn’t be alone on Valentine’s Day. I skipped school and took a bus downtown. I remembered the area from a time when my mother would drag me with her to score drugs. There was a woman in a rundown apartment building that would read palms or whip up hexes and potions. I had some money stashed away from my after- school job flipping hamburgers. The woman’s name was Tamara, or Miss Tam-Tam. She always gave me the creeps.
I remembered the night she grabbed me by the shoulders and stared into my eyes. I was in the third grade. My mom had brought me to the building to meet up with a dealer. Mom had hissed at me to keep quiet and not to touch anything. As we climbed the dingy stairs, we passed Miss Tam-Tam. Her skirts were billowing out behind her with each descending step. My hand involuntarily reached out to caress the colorful silk. Before I knew it, steel talons sank into my shoulders and whirled me around. Sharp, almost black eyes pierced my face.
“Whatchoo know about me, chil’?” her voice purred like a cat, but there was an undercurrent of hatred and malice.
I stammered, my mouth gaping as the air in my throat leaked out forming no words, only soft grunts.
“Never mind this idiot girl, Miss Tam-Tam. We’re just meeting up with Eddie,” my mother laughed, her voice small and shaking. Mother pulled me away from Miss Tam-Tam.
“I see you again, chil’,” Miss Tam-Tam laughed. “You’ll need sumtin, and I’ll give it. But you won’ like it.” Again, she cackled and with a flourish of silks she continued down the stairs, her humorless chuckles echoing off the peeling walls. I watched her disappear behind a door spray- painted with a neon green skull.
Years later, Miss Tam-Tam’s warning repeated in my head as I stepped off the bus in front of the crumbling apartment building. I waved my hands around my ears, as if I could brush the memory of her words away like a troublesome moth. A man was sitting on the building’s steps, sipping dark brown liquid from a bottle wrapped in a crinkled paper bag. I stepped past him, holding my breath to block out the musky smell of his body odor, and pulled open the door to the first-floor hallway.
A fluorescent light pulsed overhead with a buzzing hum. The flickering light bathed the cracked grey walls in cool light and only served to deepen the shadows in the corner. Though it was mid-morning, the hallway seemed dark and sepulchral.
I walked up the staircase to the third floor where I found the same glowing green skull, faded but still menacing, on a battered door. I raised my hand to knock but before my knuckles could land on the wood, the door slowly creaked open. There was a swampy smell, mingled with the metallic scent of blood. Miss Tam-Tam’s smooth voice slithered from the darkness beyond the door.
“Here you are again, chil’. Look how you grown. Come in.”
I stepped in and the door closed behind me with a soft click. My eyes adjusted to the dark and I could see the apartment was a studio, really just one large room with a small bathroom tucked away in the corner. What could have been the living room held a small round table with two chairs. On the table was a deck of cards and a long twisting knife. All along the walls of the apartment were shelves full of jars, strange plants, a few tattered books, and what looked like small bones. The makeshift kitchen was situated on the other side of the room. A large steel pot bubbled on a hot plate set up on a broken dresser.
Miss Tam-Tam stood next to the pot, stirring slowly, her back to me. I slid my backpack off my shoulders and pulled out all the money I had, a hundred dollars. I gripped the wad of cash in my fist and cleared my throat.
“I… I need a… potion,” I said. “Do you do that?”
Miss Tam-Tam turned to look at me, nodding twice. I don’t know how but she looked even taller than when I first saw her when I was a kid. She stepped towards me and I couldn’t help but shrink back against the door.
“Yes, I do,” her voice was clipped, and her black eyes bore into mine. She stopped only a foot away. I thought I could hear the sound of a swarm of bees from somewhere in the room. The soft buzzing pulsed in time with my heartbeat.
“A love potion?” I asked.
Miss Tam-Tam threw her head to the side and spat violently onto the stained carpet. Her face twisted with scorn and she shot forward, closing the distance between us, only inches away. Her lips curled into a sneer revealing mottled yellow teeth.
“Love,” the word spewed out of her mouth, slimy droplets of spit flicked onto my face. “Stupid chil’, you sure? You think that’s what you need?”
I straightened, willing myself not to blink, and raised the money to my chest. “I’m not going to be alone anymore.”
Miss Tam-Tam grunted and took the money from my hand. I exhaled slowly and closed my eyes in an effort to slow down my heart thumping wildly in my chest as she turned towards the
kitchen area. I could hear pots banging and Miss Tam-Tam muttering to herself.
My eyes flew open at once as a terrifying idea flooded my brain. What if the potion accidentally made Steven fall in love with someone else? I didn’t know how it all worked. I’d certainly seen a movie or two where that mishap occurred.
“He must want only me,” I insisted. I stepped over to stand near Miss Tam-Tam, trying to ignore the acrid smell now rising with the steam over the boiling pot.
“Of course, chil’,” Miss Tam-Tam purred. “But it takes sumtin of you to do that.”
She stepped to me and tilted her head forward, sniffing. The action reminded me of a wolf tracking prey in the snow. I froze in place while she bent lower, weaving her head back and forth across my torso.
“You having your moon cycle. I smell it fresh on you,” she looked up, her eyes gleamed as they scanned my stunned face. “That blood be the best.”
She abruptly stood and whirled over to a shelf above the hot plate and returned with a small coffee mug.
“Take this in there and put your plug in it,” she pointed to the cramped bathroom across from the living room. I nodded and took the cup.
My body shook as I sat on the toilet with one hand clutching the mug between my legs. I pulled the tampon string, catching the blood-soaked cotton cylinder in the mug with a wet plunking sound. I set the mug on the back of the toilet, avoiding looking inside and inserted a fresh tampon.
Washing my hands in the stained sink, I studied my reflection in the mirror. I looked crazy. My eyes were bulging, wet globes straining from pale skin. Two roaches twitched as they perched on the faucet.
“Even the roaches have someone,” I laughed but it didn’t sound like my laugh. It sounded a lot like Miss Tam-Tam’s horrible, empty, cold laugh.
I returned to the kitchen in time to see Miss Tam-Tam sprinkling a white powder into the pot. She took the mug from my hands with a monstrous grin. “The thirteenth is a powerful day for this spell,” she said. I realized it was Friday the thirteenth.
Perfect. More of that terrible empty laughter wriggled in my throat and I clamped my mouth shut.
Miss Tam-Tam turned and tossed the bloody contents of the mug into the boiling pot. A hiss of steam, pink in color, escaped the bubbling liquid. My stomach lurched and I wrapped my arms protectively around my body.
Miss Tam-Tam whispered in a language I’d never heard before as she stirred the liquid in what looked like very specific rotations. She ladled the thick-looking dark red potion into a small silver flask and turned to me.
“Just remember, chil’, he will be with you forever… no matter what,” she intoned, her face a statue.
“Forever,” I whispered and carefully tucked the flask into my backpack.
Before she could say another word, I ran from the apartment. Her horrible laughter followed me down the stairs and into the entry hallway. Outside the sunlight was blinding and I gulped at the fresh air.
On the bus ride home, I began to form a plan. Steven would be at Jennifer Miller’s party. I had overheard several of the kids at school talking about Jennifer’s “kick ass” Friday the 13th party.
Jennifer lived in a big, fancy house a few blocks from the school. All the popular kids would be there, and probably a few burnouts too. I figured I could sneak in relatively unnoticed. I was invisible after all. I’d pour the potion into Steven’s drink the first chance I could. Then I’d wait.
My heart pounded as I imagined having him all to myself. I imagined him holding me. My cheeks ignited. I imagined not being alone.
My mom wasn’t home, as usual, when I arrived back at the trailer. I took a long shower. I tried to wash away any lingering smell that might have contaminated me in that awful apartment. After my shower, I shifted through my mom’s closet and pulled out a mini dress. It was black, and probably the least revealing outfit she owned. I pulled the stretchy fabric over my body.
The dress was a bit loose and hung around my thin frame, but it would do.
I took time to brush and braid my hair and even swiped a little mascara onto my eyelashes. It was a special night, after all.
It was a two-mile walk to the school and just a couple blocks more to Jennifer’s house. I tied my sneakers; no dress shoes for me. The single pair of sneakers was all I had, and I knew I couldn’t make the walk wearing my mom’s ridiculous slut heels. I stuffed the potion into my jacket pocket and headed down the street.
The cold winter wind whipped around my bare legs. Along the walk I imagined Steven asking me to the prom. I imagined Steven proposing. I imagined being with Steven forever.
My pace was slow as I dreamed of never being alone again. The sun had already begun to set when I left the trailer and it was getting dark fast. I was almost halfway to the school when thunder rumbled throughout the sky. A light mist of freezing rain fell on me and I pulled my thin jacket around me as tightly as possible, thankful to feel the comforting weight of the flask in my pocket.
A car splashed past me and jerked to a halt before reversing. I knew that car. It was a completely refurbished 1976 Dodge Charger, cherry red and sexy as hell. It was Steven’s car. I had overheard him talking about it several times. He restored it with his dad. It was one of my favorite late-night fantasies to imagine Steven’s body pressed against mine in the backseat of that car.
I blinked in the increasing rainfall as the driver window lowered to reveal Steven’s beautiful face, smiling with concern.
“You need a ride?” he asked. I could already smell him, and warmth flowed through my body. I couldn’t believe my luck.
“Uhhh… y-yes, please!” I stuttered and hurried to the passenger door. The lock clicked and I scrambled in out of the rain. I couldn’t help but grin like an idiot at him while I clicked my seatbelt. I noticed he wasn’t wearing his. Such a naughty boy. So sexy. I shivered and whispered a thank you.
“No problem,” he said and began driving. “Where to?”
“Oh, I was going to Jennifer’s party,” I answered. “I heard it was going to be cool.”
To my horror, he started laughing. My stomach sank as he chuckled like someone would if a small child told a knock-knock joke.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he said after a minute. He eased his foot off the accelerator, and I could feel the car slowing. He had a half smile on his lips, a pitying smile.
He pitied me. My blood started to boil.
“Listen, you know the kids there are just going to make fun of you. You won’t have any fun around them. They can be kind of mean,” he explained still wearing that stupid nice-guy smile. His hands turned the steering wheel, pointing the car in the other direction. He was taking me back home. Back to that empty trailer with only my dead pets for company. Back to being alone.
The rain was pouring, and flashes of lightning illuminated the empty sidewalks and manicured lawns leading to cozy houses full of happy little perfect families… just like Steven’s family. He reached out to pat my shoulder and my vision flooded with red. I didn’t need his fucking pity.
He was supposed to love me, damn it.
My hand moved on its own, shooting out to grab the back of his head and slamming his shocked face against the driver’s side window with all my strength. His body tensed in surprise, and his leg straightened, jamming hard on the pedal. The engine growled and the car rocketed forward, wheels spinning on the rain-slicked streets. I could hear myself screaming with rage just before the car crashed into a massive oak tree.
There was a wet crunching sound when his face hit the steering wheel. No airbags in his precious Charger. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. I could see the top of the steering wheel disappear above his nose. His eyes popped like little grapes before the steering wheel pushed all the way into his head. Blood exploded onto the dashboard and splashed across the windshield.
The seatbelt tightened around my body, squeezing the air from my chest. My head snapped back and hit the seat with a thump. Dark butterflies blotted my vision. I heard the same horrible buzzing sound from Miss Tam-Tam’s apartment, like a thousand bees were inside my head. I started to sink into the dark.
Lightning flashed milliseconds before a booming crack of thunder erupted in the sky. I jumped and looked out my window to see if anyone was watching. The curtains covering the windows of the surrounding houses remained shut. Few lights were on, mostly the blue haze of television sets.
My brain went into overdrive, trying to figure out what to do next. The overwhelming reality of what I had just done washed over me and my lips trembled as tears fell fat and hot on my cheeks. On impulse I pulled the flask out of my pocket. It was magic right? Miss Tam-Tam said we would be together forever. Maybe it could fix this.
I set the flask on the dashboard and pulled as hard as I could on Steven’s shoulders. After several minutes of straining there was a squelching, sloppy noise, followed by what sounded like a champagne cork popping. Steven’s head flew back against his seat and a fresh spray of blood decorated the ceiling.
A wail surged out of my throat when I saw his face. His once beautiful green eyes were gone.
Instead there was a deep crevice where his skull had shattered and collapsed inward. There was nothing but a mass of blood and some kind of white, runny fluid… what was left of his eyes… mingling with the red and trailing down his face into his open mouth.
I cradled his face with both my hands and whimpered as I leaned forward to kiss his top lip. I tasted the blood and swallowed. I needed to fix him.
I grabbed the flask, snapped off the top and poured the potion into his mouth. Before it could dribble out, I pushed up on his chin to close his mouth, lifting upward to tilt his head back so the potion could slide down his throat. I held his head that way for at least a minute, waiting for even a hint of something, any sign it was working.
There was nothing.
I screamed in frustration and released his chin. His body slumped to lean against me. He looked like he was sleeping. I gently kissed the top of his head before I shifted out from under his body. I opened the passenger door and backed out, careful to let Steven’s body slide all the way down onto the seat.
I started running. I ran the entire way home, my chest burning. I slammed the door to the trailer shut, tore off my soaking jacket and kicked off my wet shoes. Walking down the hallway, I peeled off the dress and finally climbed into my bed. I cried myself to sleep and dreamed of Steven looking at me with no eyes. The next morning the news reported a high school student involved in a tragic accident. The community was shocked. The footage continued, showing stupid girls clutching each other and sobbing about how much everyone loved him. I felt so empty and more alone than I had ever felt. I crawled under the trailer and laid next to my buried pets for most of the day.
Late in the evening I finally crawled out from under the trailer and went inside. My mom still wasn’t home. I tried to eat some of the stale crackers left in the kitchen, but they were sawdust in my mouth. I gave up and shuffled into the living room and turned on the TV.
The news reporter gave an update about a small flask found in the car at the crime scene.
Police suspected drunk driving. I closed my eyes and I could see Steven’s mouth, bloody but still beautiful. I spent two hours in the living room, watching the news afraid of hearing any
witnesses seeing a woman fleeing the scene. There was no reason to suspect me, of course; no one had seen Steven pick me up in his car. No one could ever connect us. He was loved and I was invisible.
That night I crawled into my bed and pulled the threadbare blanket over my head. I was attempting to will myself to sleep when I heard the faintest creak near my door.
Slowly, I pulled the blanket past my eyes and looked at the doorway. Someone was standing there, in the dark. Someone tall. I blinked and the figure lurched forward with a jerky motion. I scrambled to sit up as the figure moved closer. The moonlight from my window threw a small square of light in the middle of the room. The figure moved into the light and I could see its face.
It was Steven. Beautiful, mangled Steven with no eyes.
He was naked and a dark, jagged Y-shaped cut was stitched closed on his torso. An autopsy scar. He stood in the light, his body swaying slightly. He looked like he was trying to hear my breathing.
I whispered his name and his head jerked to face me. His body moved quickly, scuttling in that strange jerky motion, almost like a marionette puppet with a lunatic pulling the strings. He banged his shins on the foot of my bed and then spider-crawled over me until his face was inches from mine. He didn’t smell like body wash. He smelled very dead.
He craned his neck forward until his lips rested against mine. Dry, flaking, cold lips covered mine. My first kiss. The smell of rot enveloped me, and I gagged. He shifted his body off mine and laid next to me, his arm draped across my stomach.
“Forever…” he croaked.
“Forever,” I answered and snuggled against him.
I finally wasn’t alone."	9.82	11.0	N.M. Brown	07/31/2021
Jerold’s Wait	"Jerold was sitting in the same chair, at the same window, staring outside, waiting.
The first snow was falling, and he remembered the time when he’d played out there with the neighborhood kids all those years ago.  He remembered it so vividly that afternoon.
The sun had been bright, just like today, but its light didn’t reach him.  Not anymore.  Not up here, in this ghastly room.
He didn’t even notice the single tear that streamed from one of his eyes.  Thick, yellow, and almost syrupy, it carved a path down his sunken cheek.
The shaking came over him like an avalanche, burying his thoughts.  The pain that followed was worse, cutting through him hot and ragged.
It lasted for almost a quarter of an hour.
The third time since noon, the seventh since he awoke this morning.  It’s gotten so much worse this past year.
“You there?” he called out when as he watched the few lonely snowflakes twirling through the air.
“Of course,” a rattling voice reached him.
“So, is it finally time?”
The voice behind him turned into guttural giggling.
“No, Jerold, you aren’t ready yet.”
“Oh goddammit, I’ve been ready for the past three years!  I’m ready now, so why don’t you just take me already?”
“Were they ready, Jerold?”
He was about to reply, but a terrible, wet cough rattled through his body, shaking every brittle bone in it.
“Damn you!” he screamed, but he got no reaction to his outburst.
He tried to dig his fingers into the armrest, tried to will himself to get up, but however much he tried, there was nothing.  He had no energy left, no muscles to serve him.
And so he stayed where he was, in his terrible, lonely prison.
Slowly anger rose inside of him, burning anger, fiery, hotter even than the pain he’d felt mere moments ago.
“Why don’t you just take me already?” he screamed at the quiet room.
“You know why, Jerold,” a bodiless, grim voice whispered into his ear.
“Yes, I know, but I couldn’t help it!  I tried, but couldn’t wait anymore, I just couldn’t.”
“You murdered them, Jerold.  Three little boys, whose life you cut short that afternoon,” the voice continued.
“I know, goddammit, I know!  I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, so take me already!  Just, please, please let me move on!”
“No, Jerold.  You’ll wait, and you’ll continue to wait.  For I’m going to let you live in their stead.  What time you took from them, I’ve added to yours,” the voice trailed off, a hint of devilish glee hidden behind its words.
“I shouldn’t even be alive anymore!  The heart attack, the cancer, this rotting body here, there’s-”
But he broke up, for Jerold knew he was gone again.
Once more, the Reaper had abandoned him, and once more he’d left his soul to linger in his own rotten body for yet another year."	9.33	18.0	Craig Groshek	06/17/2021
This is Taylor	"911 gets three kinds of calls.  There’s the “someone needs help” call, obviously.  That’s the sort that most of our training deals with, and it’s the kind that everyone pictures first when they think of 911.  You could, if you wanted, subdivide these calls into “actual problems” and “people who need to learn to solve their own issues.”  But the people calling in legitimately think they need our help, so I’m keeping them lumped together here.
Then there’s the wrong-number category.  Again, you could split this up into “stayed on the line to apologize” and “hung up and made us send police,” but it’s all the same idea.  You’d be surprised how much of our training focuses on these, too.  With the folks who stay on to apologize, you have to absolve them of their guilt so they’ll hang up quickly and not tie up the line.  With the ones who hang up, you have to learn to manage your own panic, at least early on.  They often won’t pick up when you call back, so then you end up running through worst-case scenarios in your head, thinking that if only you’d been able to pick up a second sooner, you might have saved someone’s life.  In the end, the police nearly always find that there was nothing wrong.  When I started, we had an entire seminar on how not to wind yourself up over nothing.  Didn’t really help, but at least it was a nice thought.
And then there are spam calls.  You know, the reason that no one picks up their phone for unknown numbers anymore?  But while you can just thumb “ignore” and drop the phone unanswered, we don’t get that luxury.  We answer every call that comes in.  No blocking numbers, no screening.
Spam accounts for over half of all phone calls these days.  And while some of the robodialers are smart enough to exclude our numbers, plenty either don’t know enough, or don’t care enough.  So several times during every shift, I end up having a conversation like this:
THEM: “Yes, this is such-and-such with the IRS.  Your payment is overdue.” ME: “Do you know it’s a felony to call 911 without an emergency?” Now, you’d think that would be the end of it.  There’d be a click, the call would end, I’d move on with my day.  But in fact, most of them will argue with me over it, telling me that they know what number it called, and it wasn’t 911.  I used to try to explain that 911 was a relay number and that our phones had actual, unpublished numbers as well, but those explanations never went anywhere.
Now I mainly just say, “Please stay on the line.  We’re tracing this call.”  That tends to get a pretty immediate hang-up.
A couple of months back, though, I got a guy persistent enough to stay through even that line.  The call started off like they all do.
“This is Taylor with Microsoft, and we have been getting reports that your PC is infected.” “Sir, this is 911.  Please hang up if you don’t have an emergency.” He brushed right past my line like I hadn’t said anything.  “I can provide help with this problem.  Are you at your computer?” “I am.  I’m in a dispatch center for 911.  Go ahead and stay on the line.  We’re tracing this call.” “You do not need to lie to me.  I am trying to help.  Me helping is going to solve your problem.  I need you to listen carefully.” “I need you to get off of the phone.  People have real emergencies.” “Listen.  You do not want my help?  Assuming you do not treat this problem—” “There’s nothing wrong with my computer, and you are not with Microsoft.” There was a pause, a sigh, and a click as the call ended.
As the day went on, though, I kept coming back to that call in my mind.  It wasn’t just that he’d been more persistent than usual.  There had been something odd about his cadence.  He’d had a thick Indian accent, so maybe I’d just been imagining it, and it was just a normal pattern for him.
Still, it kept eating at me.  Eventually, I pulled up the audio recording to listen to it again and ease my mind.
The first line sounded normal, and I felt foolish for how much brain space I’d devoted to this.  But as I was reaching to stop the recording, he started the second line.
There was a clear emphasis on “provide help.”  His whole line had been “I can provide help,” but the “I can” had been mumbled.  Was he asking for help?
I played it back several times.  There was a small but definite pause after the word “help,” too.  It didn’t sound accidental.
I let the recording play on, and became convinced that the pause I’d heard was intentional.  There were more like it, odd moments that broke up the flow of the sentences to emphasize certain words—almost always around the word “help.”
Two sentences ran together to make the phrase “help me.”  Another, if you took just the first syllable of the next word “assuming,” was “help us.”
I played the recording over and over.  I couldn’t be imagining this.  He’d even said, “I need you to listen carefully.”  I’d missed it.  He’d called in needing help, and I’d shooed him away.
I checked the call location information, but it just pointed to an office center in Texas.  It was possible that this guy was in Texas, but it was a lot more likely that that was just where the call was being routed through.  I had nothing, no way to trace this at all.
I barely slept that night, thinking about how I’d screwed up.  How desperate do you have to be to start sneaking coded messages into your speech, hoping that someone picks up on it?  And if they do understand, how are they supposed to do anything?  Through sheer luck he’d gotten through to 911, to maybe the only people who could have helped—and I’d missed it.  This guy was still trapped in whatever conditions had caused him to reach out like this, because I hadn’t understood.  Still trapped if he was lucky, maybe.  If someone there had picked up on his hints, he could be dead.
Morning came, and I dragged myself to work.  I told myself that it wasn’t my fault, that I couldn’t always save everyone.  I put on a fake smile for my coworkers and manned the phones, and even I didn’t realize exactly how much it had depressed me until I answered one call and heard a familiar voice.
“This is Taylor with Mastercard, and we are calling to make you a special offer.” My heart leaped.  “Taylor!  I can help you.”
Click.  The line went dead.
“Stupid, stupid!” I hissed at myself.  Obviously, he was afraid that someone was listening in, or he wouldn’t have been trying to hide his message in the first place.  And here I was just announcing everything to anyone that might be on the line.  Still, at least he knew that his message had gotten through.  He’d called back before.  I had to believe that he would again.
I checked the call location again, figuring that if it was the same place I could at least get a local officer to go take a look.  No luck; this time it claimed to have originated from Seattle.  I was going to have to figure out some other way to get the location.
It was two days before Taylor called back again.
“I wanted to let you know that your automobile insurance is about to lapse.” “Yeah?” I asked, my heart beating fast.  I tried to sound like an average call.  “You don’t sound like you’re with my insurance company.  Are you in India?” “India?  Ah,” Taylor said, “You mean my accent.  I am in Macon.  Yes, I am.” “C’mon, not with an accent like that,” I pressed him.  “Where are you really?” “Macon,” he insisted.  “It is where Geico is.  You can Google it if you like.” “Geico’s not even my insurance company,” I said.
“I am sorry.  I must have made a mistake.”  Click.
Once again, I found myself listening to the recording, trying to discover what I’d missed.  It turned out that Geico did have a large call center in Georgia, but I doubted that that was the real answer.  It was too easy, and also didn’t make any sense.  Georgia certainly had its problems, but it seemed unlikely that they were imprisoning anyone in call centers.
The only thing that I noticed about the call was that Taylor had pronounced “am” oddly the first two times he’d said it, almost like he was starting to say “ambulance.”  He used the word again at the end of the call, and it didn’t have that subtle B sound that time.  It was definitely a hint, but I had no idea what to do with it.
I tried Googling it, as he’d suggested, but it just brought up random words and celebrities starting with “amb.”  I tried a few other things, but kept coming up blank.  Finally, out of frustration, I just started typing in the entire transcript of the call, one line at a time.
When I started the second line, I got only two words in before Google’s auto-suggest turned “India Ah” into “india ahmedabad.”  A quick trip to Wikipedia told me that this was a major city in India, and I started to feel hopeful before I realized that it was home to over six million people.  That was a lot like narrowing the call down to “somewhere in New York City.”
On a hunch, I added “amb” to the end of my “india ahmedabad” search string.  Google suggested “bank of india ambawadi ahmedabad.”  Probably Taylor wasn’t calling from the Bank of India, but the important information there was that there was a neighborhood in Ahmedabad called Ambawadi.  This was a much more reasonable area to search.
At least, so it seemed to me.  It took several weeks of arguments for me to convince my superiors that there was something to this.  Everyone admitted that it was odd that Taylor kept calling back regularly, but not everyone agreed with my conclusions no matter how many times I played the recordings.  Still, the small clues kept piling up and confirming each other, and finally, someone with enough pull managed to get their counterparts in India to agree to go track down this call center.
Taylor called in the day before it was all supposed to happen, telling me that my refrigerator was under a recall notice.
“Listen, buddy,” I told him.  “I know what you’re up to.  If you ever call here again, so help me, I will come find where you are and drag you out into the street.”
“Sir, your threats do not bother me.  I will be waiting.” “Not for long,” I snarled.  He hung up the phone.
I let out my breath in a whoosh.  All I could do at this point was hope.
The next day, it was all over the news.  The IPS had raided an office building in Ahmedabad and discovered an entire floor of people who had been kidnapped and forced to work there.  They were literally chained to their desks during the day, and had nearby cots where they were tethered at night.  All of them were emaciated, and nearly all bore open wounds or missing digits from where they had been punished for one infraction or another.
I saw the news, and I wondered which one was Taylor.  Obviously, it wasn’t his real name.  Probably I would never know.
I was re-reading the article when the phone rang.
“This is Taylor with Microsoft, and we have been getting reports that your PC is infected.” Had they raided the wrong center?  How many of these could there possibly be?  Maybe they’d just missed a floor or something.
I swallowed my panic and tried to respond normally.  “What’s wrong with it?” “It is generating some very grave reports.  I think the problem might be worse than you expect.  Can you let me dig around in the files?” “I don’t think I can give you that access.”
“If I do not get behind the system files, I cannot show you how deep the problem lies.” “I’ll take a look myself,” I said.  “Thank you for letting me know.” After some convincing, the IPS returned to the office building and searched in the lot behind it.  They discovered dozens of bodies buried in a mass grave, jumbled together and left to rot.  Most looked to have been severely beaten, then dumped in the hole either already dead or to die of their wounds.  They still wore the bloody clothes they had died in.  A few even still had their phone headsets clamped around their heads.
We still get spam calls at work, and I still threaten the callers with tracing the call.  But I always listen closely to how they respond, to the words they choose.  You never know who might be calling out for help, or how hard they’ve had to work to reach you."	9.75	12.0	Micah Edwards	05/21/2021
The Worms Crawl In	"Dusty Creek was a dried-up old town. It had been small since its inception, and smaller still since the draft had begun. You could run in to everyone you knew within the space of one hot afternoon, and by God, you knew everyone. You knew friends, and you knew enemies, and from day to day it was hard to tell the difference. At least, this was the case for young Billy Monroe.
Billy was a washed-out, pale-haired eleven-year-old boy, the runt of a pack of four local lads. The four boys, all roughly the same age, generally ended up playing together – not because of any particular fondness for each other, but rather that in a town of that size beggars could not be choosers. Because of this, the line between play and bullying was a vague and often unimportant concept.
The boys usually merged together in the town square. There was nothing to draw them there other than convenience. No butcher, baker, or candlestick maker – just a grocery of dwindling stock, an unfrequented haberdashery, and some faded posters advertising the benefits of a victory garden (a hopeless endeavor in Dusty Creek) and a woman declaring that we can do it (equally hopeless as there was nothing to do).
They had passing phases of interest, generally led by the whims of one Caleb Jacobs, a medium-sized, freckle-faced boy who was the unspoken leader of the pack. One month it was jacks, another month cards (though this was quickly put to an end by the hen-like ladies passing by, convinced that the boys were playing that morally corrupting game called poker). After that there came pirates, followed by jungle adventurers. These phases would always come on suddenly, only to snuff out just as quickly
All, that is, except marbles.
Who knows why marbles was a permanent fixture of the group – it simply was. A game could break out at any time, so the boys always carried their leather sacks of marbles. They generally didn’t play for keeps, as the boys wished to hold onto their own meager collections, though Caleb could sometimes convince them to risk losing their cherished marbles with a rough and condescending tone.
Billy Monroe was especially attached to his collection. Or rather, to a single large shooting marble.
It was a true prize – a two-color spiral snake marble, with twists of oxblood and pearly mint coiling just under the clear glass surface. It was miles above the others’ simple single colored agates and scavenged ball bearings.
It was a hot afternoon, just like every afternoon, when Caleb decreed a game of marbles. With some judicious brow-beating, he was also able to persuade the pack into playing a game for keeps.
A playing circle was quickly scratched into the dirt, and the boys were now carefully choosing which of their own marbles they might be willing to sacrifice. When Billy Monroe pulled his jewel of a marble out of his sack, he gave the marble a comically exaggerated kiss for good luck before nestling the treasure beside him in the sandy soil – well outside of the bounds of the circle.
Roy Jones, a broad, thick lipped boy with hands the size of pan lids, sneered at him.
“Why do you keep that ol’ shooter even though you never use it?” he drawled. “Doesn’t make sense.”
“What are you talking about?” said Billy. “I use it all the time.”
Roy clicked his tongue. “You know what I mean, when we play for keeps, like we’re doing now.”
“Well it’s lucky! It’s always been lucky. No sense in the world sending you some luck if you’re only going to give it away right back.”
Roy pouted. “I’m just saying that it’s not fair that you don’t use that shooter when we play for keeps,” he spat out.
Billy scowled. “How’s it not fair? I’m not breaking any rules using a different shooter. We can use whatever we want. Right, Caleb?”
Caleb nodded sagely, leading to a round of snickering.
“Roy just wants it for himself,” laughed Matt, a black haired string bean of a boy. “I don’t think you’d risk that marble either if you had it, Roy.”
Roy huffed at this call out. “That’s bullcrap, and you know it,” he growled. “Who would want that fussy old marble anyway? It’s just a stinking snake marble. Who wants those?”
Roy grinned darkly at his new train of thought. “Know what?” Roy jeered. “I bet those aren’t even snakes. You know what those colory bits looks like to me? Worms. Wriggly, crawly, slimy worms.” Roy barked a cold laugh. “Do you love worms that much, Billy? Like your gramps? I bet your gramps looooves worms. Comes home covered in them from shoveling worm food all day. Just can’t get enough of them.”
Old Man Monroe, Billy’s grandfather, was the local gravedigger, a taciturn, long-faced man who seemed more at ease among the silent dead than his neighbors.
“Why do you keep itching for this damn marble, then?” said Billy. “I thought you hated worms. Or maybe you want to eat it? Can’t forget that yummy sandwich? Does Roy want a widdle snack?”
“Stop it!” Roy spat through gritted teeth, yet even as he spoke his insides spasmed. Roy’s stomach couldn’t help but roil at the memory, and the other boys laughed richly as he burned red from anger and embarrassment.
Last spring, the group had chosen to bring lunch pails to school in order to play jacks during the midday break. Caleb had deigned to offer Roy half of his ham sandwich, knowing that the quickly bulking boy couldn’t refuse a chance at rationed meat. Roy had eagerly chomped off a large, ravenous bite.
Within one chew, Roy realized that had been bitterly deceived, as a slimy, earth tasting paste gummed itself between his teeth. He dropped the sandwich, and as he gazed down he saw bits of worm fall onto his chest and stomach and the sandwich contents writhing and wriggling where they lay.
He had screamed so loudly that he attracted the attention of the entire square, from the busy shop keeper, to the hen hatted ladies, and even to Old Man Monroe, shuffling about doing rare errands that required personal interaction.
With some deep breaths and a careful swallow, Roy brought himself back to the present. The churning in his stomach morphed into a burning bilious fire.
“Well that marble didn’t do your Pa any good, did it?” he hissed. “That lucky marble. Bet it’s cursed. I bet your old gramps hates himself for giving it to him.”
“It’s not cursed!” shouted Billy, his face scrunched up and red. “And it was lucky! At least Pa came back to be buried in one piece. That’s more than you can say for your uncle,” he jeered. “Bet he wasn’t even blown up. Bet it’s a lie, that he ran off with some French floozy-”
Roy launched himself at Billy, punching him square in the jaw. It took a moment for Billy to recover, but he quickly hunched over and drove his shoulder into Roy’s stomach like some kind of crazed berserker. The movement forced a spat of bile up into Roy’s mouth, and he gagged as he fell hard onto his rear. The rest of the boys burst out laughing.
“Okay, okay, settle down, guys,” said Caleb, after he had had his fill of derisive mirth. “Roy, you shouldn’t have said that about his marble, and Billy, you shouldn’t have said that about his uncle. Truce, ok?”
Billy toed the ground. “Yeah,” he mumbled, “I guess.”
“Roy?”
Roy was still coughing on the bile in his throat.
“Well, whatever. C’mon guys, let’s get out of here.”
As the rest of the pack shuffled away, Roy had managed to right himself. He brushed dirt off of his face with the back of his hand.
“I’ll kill you, Billy Monroe,” he growled. “I’ll kill you.”
* * * * * *
A week had passed, and another game of marbles had begun.
All resentment over the argument seemed to have been erased and written over with other petty squabbles and name calling.
The pack was once more gathered in the square, squatting by a circle of iron railing meant to protect the scorched and withered sapling inside of it. The railing was being used as a makeshift prison camp, a mighty fortress housing sun-bleached clothes-pin POWs. Their comrades had planned a rescue, but sadly they had all collapsed on the field of battle when Caleb demanded a game of marbles. What’s more, another game for keeps.
The boys reached for their leather sacks and emptied their contents onto the dirt. Once more, Billy took the beautiful marble and gently placed it at his side, safe and sound.
The bitterness that Roy thought he had forgotten bubbled up, and he grabbed the marble where it lay nestled next to Billy.
“You’re going to use it this time! Show us just how lucky it is!”
Billy squealed and grabbed at Roy’s wrists for the marble which he held aloft. When the side of Billy’s fist planted itself into Roy’s chest, Roy lost himself completely and shoved Billy hard.
What happened next was an accident. A solid plant, perhaps accompanied with a thump on the head, then running off in tears, and that should have been the end of it. That was supposed to be the end of it. But the luck of Billy’s marble soured that day. In one stumbling step backward, Billy’s foot landed on a cluster of marbles, sending him careening in a violent arch. In his fall, Billy struck the iron tree guard and landed in a heap on his side.
The boys were laughing, and as their guffaws turned into big huffs of steadying breath, they began to wonder at Billy’s stillness.
“Billy,” said Caleb, “stop playing possum.”
“You can get up now Billy, don’t be such a baby.”
The commentary hushed as they noticed a trickle of blood coming from his ear, and soon another streaming down his nose.
They didn’t move, they didn’t speak. They could only watch as Billy lay lifeless, his skin, shirt collar, and even the soil around him became stained with red.
The shopkeeper was the first adult to notice, as he had seen the fight and had stomped down the square to break it up. Upon seeing the scene before him, he let out a loud yell. A commotion was soon started, with some people shouting about the need for a doctor and others shaking their head over the mysterious whims of the good Lord.
As the adults crowded in, the boys were pushed away, as empty and dumb as the body crumpled on the ground.
* * * * * *
A brief inquiry had been held, and while Roy was subjected to the stern looks and long-winded scolding of the town doctor, it had been decided that Billy had died by Misadventure. Two days later, the town gathered to see Billy off to his final resting place. Old Man Monroe was not rich, thus Billy’s coffin was a simple pinewood box. The large nails splintered the wood around the place they had been hammered in, contributing to a vaguely warped and weak appearance. Monroe sat next to it, a gentle hand resting against it protectively as his neighbor’s rusted old cart, used in place of a hearse, trundled down the dirt road to the graveyard. Men had their hats off, women daintily dabbed at the corners of their eyes with their handkerchiefs.
Children were there as well, many of them bored or confused.
Roy was standing next to Matthew, the weakest of the group now that Billy had passed.
“I don’t get why we need to stand here and watch,” muttered Roy with a scowl. “I mean, we already know he’s dead, why do we need to look at his box?”
“It’s respectful, I guess,” mumbled Matthew, though he seemed unsure in the face of Roy’s strong opinion.
Roy suddenly grinned.
“Hey Matt,” he whispered conspiratorially. “Look what I got.”
Roy opened his clenched hand to reveal Billy’s spiral snake marble.
Matthew gasped.
“Roy!” he hissed in a frantic whisper. “You can’t keep that!”
“What do you mean?”
“You should give that back to Old Man Monroe, it’s important to him-”
“You’re talking horseshit,” hissed Roy. “It’s not like he plays marbles. He’s too busy messing around with worm food all day.”
“But,” said Matt weakly, “it belongs to their family-”
“Not anymore, Matthew,” said Roy. “I grabbed it fair and square.”
“Wait, did you take it when he died?”
“Sure,” Roy shrugged. “He wasn’t going to use it anymore.”
Matthew’s mouth hung agape.
“What’s the big deal? He was already dead; there wasn’t anything we could do to help him.”
“I mean, sure I guess, but still-”
“You gonna squeal on me?”
“N-no,” muttered Matthew, eyes downcast.
“That’s what I thought.”
There was suddenly a commotion. The wheel of the old cart had hit a rock, and the rickety old thing broke. The coffin slipped from the suddenly tilted floor, causing a splintery dent at the head.
Amid the panicked and concerned shouts of the adults, and as Old Man Monroe gazed helplessly into the crowd, Roy simply threw his head back and laughed, the marble twinkling in his hand.
* * * * * *
Some days had passed, and Roy found himself alone in his small attic room. Watery moonlight streamed through the window, and outside there was nothing to hear but the chittering cicadas and the occasional mournful hoot of an owl.
His mother would whip him if she knew that he hadn’t yet gone to sleep, but she was visiting her sister the next town over, and Roy simply couldn’t stop admiring his ill-gotten treasure.
He cradled it in his palms, feeling the slight chill of glass warm as it absorbed his heat. He held it in one hand, opening it flat so that the marble could roll gently over his skin. He held it between his fingers, angling it into the moonlight, thrilling at the rich glow of the colorful snakes inside.
Roy was only dimly aware of the heavy flap of wings and a sudden lull in the cicadas’ cries, but his attention was soon grabbed when he heard a noise alien to his usual experience. It was a faint, metallic snik.
What kind of sound could that be? he wondered. It seemed to have come from outside.
He pressed his face against his window, the glass becoming damp under the steam from his nose. At first he found nothing amiss, but then he saw something that made his heart drop. From his perch, he could just make out the flung open cellar doors, the old rusted chain which usually kept the doors closed flung carelessly aside.
As Roy puzzled blankly over this oddity he heard a sudden creak in the floorboards downstairs. His blood chilled, and for a long time he remained frozen. The steps continued, each tread sending a new shiver of panic up his spine. His hand began hurting, and he realized that he was clutching the marble so hard that his nail beds had turned white.
He stared at the marble in horror as a sudden realization came over him. The marble. It must be the marble. Billy had come back for it. How soon would it be before he ascended the stairs and crept into his room? All manner of folk tales and ghoulish myths flooded him.
Within a few minutes, though, the tread ceased.
Billy knew where his room was, and would know where to look for him. Roy swallowed hard as he realized that he needed to make an escape.
Roy winced at the creak of his door hinge. Poking his head out carefully, he didn’t see anything in the cramped hall. He carefully walked down the stairs, counting ten heart beats before silently shifting his foot onto the next step, a process which was becoming faster as his heart rate began to rise.
There weren’t any apparitions or ghostly moans. Maybe he could make it? He could go to the neighbor’s house and say there was a snake…
He reached the bottom of the stairs. Roy held his breath until it burned, attempting to guess at which floorboard would creak the least. He eventually screwed up his courage and pressed his toes forward, preparing for a whip crack to sound in his ears.
Roy was puzzled when no betraying noise came, but then horrified when he realized why. Instead of hitting the bare wood he expected, Roy had stepped into a squish of soft ground. A freezing coil of terror slithered up his spine as he tried to identify the substance. All manner of wild, nightmarish guesses sprang to mind, but it was a patch of watery moonlight by an uncurtained window that revealed the truth.
Soil.
Once the realization hit, it was followed by an overwhelming stench. Somehow fear had blocked it from him, but now was practically holding Roy’s face into it. It was dead earth – a sickening combination of wet stone and rotting weeds.
Roy’s eyes roamed helplessly, and a pale wash of moonlight revealed the true horror. Trails of dank soil lead all over the house. Chunks of it, skids of it. All of it reeking of the grave.
Roy started to cry.
“I’m sorry, Billy,” he wept. “I’m sorry! Here – you can have your marble back. Is that what you want? It’s yours! I’m sorry!”
He held out the marble into the shadowy emptiness in cupped, trembling hands, hot tears dripping down his cheeks.
A dark, dirt-covered shadow rose over him. Roy gasped, burning and dry, just before a shovel bashed over his head, stamping out his short, miserable life.
* * * * * *
Old Man Monroe trod silently up the path to the graveyard. He was a strong man, and his burden was light on his shoulders. He soon reached his goal – a yawning hole rimmed with damp earth. Monroe was used to moonlight and had decided not to use a lantern. He gently slid down the side of the hole, gingerly placing his feet between the wall of wet earth and the pinewood box before removing the loosely nailed lid.
“Here you go, Billy.” The old man slid the marble into a gap between Billy’s stiff fingers, so that he appeared to be fondly holding it close. To the old man, it seemed that a small smile briefly ghosted over Billy’s lips before resuming their restful state.
He carefully climbed out of the hole after gently placing the lid back on, then once more scattered dirt onto the coffin with somber serenity.
He did not fill it up, however. There was yet one more thing to be done.
He roughly tossed a bloody mass into the hole. It was Roy, his mouth agape, his brains spilling out of his broken skull.
The old man reached into his pocket, ready to give another treasure.
Worms. Worms everywhere. He had spent hours plucking them from the damp earth, cooing at them with promises of a grand feast. He scattered them over the entire length of Roy’s body. Already they were wriggling and poking at the still-warm flesh, with one particularly curious specimen slowly burrowing into the pink pulp at his scalp.
As a final touch, the old man stuffed a handful into Roy’s open mouth. He spit upon the corpse, then cackled with a final departing message.
“Enjoy your meal, Roy.”"	8.64	11.0	Craig Groshek	04/30/2021
I Knocked on Death’s Door	"I stood on the rain-slicked doorstep of a refurbished two-story house just outside of the city.
I looked at the take-out order in my hand, then the app on my phone to make sure I was delivering it to the right location.  Through casual conversation, other drivers had warned me not to take any orders from this house. Apparently, it was a favorite spot for prank calls and fake orders.  Despite the fresh paint and rebuilt structure of the home, there was a dark history that couldn’t be erased.
A killer had lived there.  He was some random psychopath, responsible for countless missing persons throughout the area.  He apparently died in a house fire, no doubt caused by someone who had figured out what he was doing.  The authorities found evidence of his crimes in the debris, in the form of countless human bones.
Some optimistic investor must’ve bought the land cheap and rebuilt with the intention of flipping it for a profit.  The joke was on them.  Nobody local would live on the site of a notorious mass murder, and anyone who came in from out of state would definitely want to live closer to the city.  A modest home in the boondocks wasn’t the most appealing prospect, with or without the dark history.
Right off the bat, I should mention that I was never one to believe in supernatural bullshit.  I wasn’t one to avoid something just because a friend-of-a-friend had some spooky personal anecdote to tell about it.  So when I saw an open opportunity to track down whoever had been wasting the time of random drivers, I took it.  I don’t consider myself a “tough guy” or anything, but I don’t shy away from confrontation, either.
I set the food by the front door, with the receipt, and took a photo to confirm delivery.  It was nothing special, just a burger from some small local joint.  Rare, no fries, no drink.  Barely worth ordering in the first place, to be honest.
I knew what would happen next.  Nothing.  Some idiot watching from an unseen location would snicker to himself like an asshole and would then try to cancel the order.  He would claim I had gotten the order wrong, or that I had eaten part of it.  Anything to negate the sale and keep his money.
Yeah, sometimes I eat some.  Relax, we all do it.
What this guy hadn’t counted on, however, was that I had scoped the place out, and I was ready to jump back in my car and follow anyone who looked remotely suspicious.  If it turned out to be the right person, then depending on size and stature, I might give him a smack or two.  Hell, at the very least, I’d make him think he was getting one.
I knocked on the door, but only as a formality.  Then, I stepped back and gazed around the property, peering into the thick tree lines surrounding it.  The dude who had been antagonizing my co-workers for weeks could have been anywhere out there.
Imagine my shock when, as my back was turned, I heard the familiar squeal of the front door creaking open just a crack.
I turned in time to see the bag disappearing into the doorway.  I could barely make out the hand; its skin pale, maybe even silver or gray.  At that point, I was confused.  Not only was someone living in the formerly unsalable horror house, but from what little I had seen, they seemed to be an older person.  Really old.  I hadn’t thought about it until that point, but no one I had seen using the food delivery app was older than forty.  Elderly customers tended to dine out as one of few social experiences they had left…or they would just cook for themselves instead of supposedly “wasting” money on delivery.
Chuckling to myself for buying into the idea I was being pranked, I looked at my phone to make sure the order had been completed.  No cancellation, no complaints, five-star rating.  Perfect.
Then, I saw the coin.
A single, shimmering gold coin lay where I had placed the bag.
“That’s an odd tip,” I commented out loud, though I’m sure the customer inside couldn’t hear me at that point.
I scooped the coin up and studied it in my hands, turning it over several times.  It felt warm to the touch, and I presumed it was from being in the customer’s pocket.  A few markings in a language I didn’t understand encircled the image of a wolf’s head.  On the flip side, I traced my finger along the outline of a country I didn’t recognize.  The detail was amazing, and the coin looked shiny and new while still showing signs of being ancient and obscure.  I was immediately transfixed.
“Thanks!” I called out, louder this time.
No response.
I spent the night researching that coin.  Something about it had seized my interest, and all I could do was flip it over and over in my hand.  I’m nowhere near an expert, never even had a coin collection as a kid.  Naturally, casual web searches and scrolling through image galleries of rare currency didn’t turn up anything of note.
I considered asking around – maybe it was yet another local thing that someone could explain – but when I considered who to ask, there were no great options.  All of my friends were just as dumb as I was, if not dumber, and the only person I knew who was good with money was my pot dealer.  My dealer, by the way, had a habit of confusing me with other customers and getting mad about things I hadn’t done.  These weren’t exactly people I’d trust with a key to my apartment, much less an artifact that seemed so incredibly rare and valuable to me.
Why did it seem so important?
My obsession with the coin became so pronounced that I began waiting for another order from the cursed house.  I wanted to ask the owner about what he had given me, and yeah, I wanted another one if he would be so kind as to leave the same tip again.  For hours on end, I checked my phone with measured excitement, hoping to get that order again.  Instead, I saw normal requests popping up across the area.  Requests that I summarily denied and left for some other driver to pick up.
Suddenly, this was more important to me than the extra cash that was paying for the creature comforts in my life.  Mostly the aforementioned marijuana.
Finally, the alert I had been waiting for popped up.  Same location, same order.  I wasted no time accepting the job.  Then I threw my shoes on and all but leaped out the door.  It was almost like he knew I was doing nothing but waiting for that call, and that he made sure to draw out the suspense until I couldn’t stand the questions any longer.
I rolled the coin through my fingers with one hand as I drove to my destination, my eyes occasionally glancing to the fast-food bag on the passenger’s seat.  Burger.  Rare.  No fries.  No drink.  What did it mean?  It seemed like a message I wasn’t picking up on.  Was said message an offer?  A warning? Either way, the burning grip of rampant curiosity had a hold on me, and I was powerless to do anything but seek answers.
“Hey. I’m back,” I called out as I walked the desolate dirt path up to the front door.  I checked the windows, top and bottom floor, for any sign of someone inside.  “I’ve got your order.  Again.”
I put the bag by the front door again, this time with a sort of sense of reverence, like placing a holy offering.
“Nice and fast,” I commented, sure the customer couldn’t hear me, anyway.  “So, like, you know…tips appreciated and all that.”
The door cracked open again, this time in my full view.  The same withered hand reached out again, seizing the bag in yellowed, long talon-like fingernails.  I could see it clearly, this time, and I could tell that while the hand resembled that of a person, it was far from authentically human.
My blood ran cold, and I found myself frozen in place, staring at the gnarled hand as it pulled the bag inside.
A single coin rolled out of the doorway on its side, and instantly I felt myself uncontrollably grinning like an idiot.  As I reached for it, the hand darted out once more, pressing the coin beneath one elongated, bony finger.  It then scraped the coin back to the threshold and picked it up.
“Hey,” I complained, my brow furrowing in confusion.  “What’re you doing?”
The door slammed shut.
I felt horrible.  Not like something had been taken away from me, but like I had tried to take something I hadn’t earned.  It’s difficult to explain now, but I was possessed of an overwhelming urge of servitude that seemed to swell out of nowhere.  It was something I hadn’t even remotely experienced since I was a child, disappointing my parents in a thousand different ways.
My phone beeped to let me know I had a new alert.
The order hadn’t been marked as completed yet, and I noticed that the message was coming from the very customer I had just served.  He had sent two simple words, innocent enough on their own, but together they spoke volumes.
“Something more.”
I knew.  Immediately, I knew.  A loathsome sort of self-hatred worked its way through my veins as I knew I fully understood the words.
Something more.  There was no question in my mind, and the pounding of my heart only compelled me forward.  The order was clear.  He wanted me to deliver a human being directly to his door.  No muss, no fuss.  The concept was as clear to me as if I had thought of it myself, though I quickly understood that something more unnatural was at play.
Frustrated, frantic, I drove around the city for a few hours, wasting what I knew to be crucial amounts of time.  My mind went back to every serial killer horror story I’d ever seen on the nightly news.  Who were the prime targets?  People who went missing every day, with no one to know they were gone.  Human debris in a corporately controlled system that didn’t value anyone without immediate monetary value.
I rode by homeless people.  Prostitutes.  The sun had set, and the streets were an ever-growing, sprawling buffet of leftovers.  I had no idea who to choose, how to choose them, or even how I would get them to go with me.  I wrestled with the idea of whether or not I could actually drive them all the way out to that house…if I could lure them to the door, or if I would lose my nerve and tell them to run.  All I knew for sure was that I was taking way too long.  Food delivery is a service that thrives on promptness.
My phone went off again.  Fearing it might be a cancellation from my prized customer, now my only customer, I quickly pulled over onto the curb and checked my messages.
What a relief.  Just Kyle – my drug dealer.
He demanded I call him back the moment I got his message.  Since I was still stuck in my own head with no leads on a good target, I obliged his less-than-cordial request.  He threw in a few choice profanities to make sure I understood the urgency.
As I already assumed, he was mad.  Again.  He had me mixed up with yet another buyer of his, someone who owed him quite a good deal of money and had apparently made a rude comment about his sister.  No amount of explaining his mistake would work.  It never did.  I guess I always had that kind of face, unremarkable and easily forgotten.
He threatened to cut me off from every dealer he knew, and said he’d stomp my ankles if he wasn’t paid within the month.  Only then did the light finally go on in my head.
“Tell you what,” I said, making an illegal U-turn, “I have some game consoles at home, and I barely use them.  Lemme pay you back with those, if it’s cool.  Where can I pick you up?”
All the way to the house, I could tell Kyle was trying to memorize the way there.  For all he knew, I was taking him directly to where I lived, and if he played his cards right, he could come back later and case the house.  Why stop at a few gaming systems if he could get a television and some other valuables, right?
The ride was chilly, at best.  He checked his phone even more than I did, no doubt telling a series of stoners and crack heads that he’d get back to them when he was good and ready.  I didn’t know where the line was in terms of what he would or wouldn’t sell – for all I knew, he was sitting on a meth operation and some very time-sensitive cooking processes.
I made him out to be worse and worse in my head.  It would it easier to turn this simple, selfish deed into something nobler.  In time, I could convince myself that I was ridding society of a parasite.  Of course, it was one I was all too ready to work with in the past with no moral question…but hey, people grow and change, right?
“Here we go.  Home sweet home,” I said, trying to sound as casual as possible given the circumstances.  I’m sure my voice was shaking.
Kyle pulled himself out of the car and stood on the brown, dead lawn, his eyes still fixed on his phone.
“You want me to bring them our, or…” I trailed off, waiting for his response.
Instead, he silently turned off his phone and walked toward the front door.  Of course, I knew he’d want to go in for himself.  He’d probably unlock a window or at least scope out the best way to break in later.  There was zero chance he’d let me bring out my property to pay off the bill I didn’t actually owe.
Predictable.
“What’d you say it all was?” Kyle asked absently as he stood by the door.  “Xbox, PlayStation, and whatnot?  I’ve been looking for a Dreamcast.  Those are crazy expensive now.  You have a Dreamcast, and we’re good with that alone.”
I didn’t respond.
I just waited.
“Yo.  Unlock it and gimme my stuff,” he insisted, checking the time on his screen.
“I think it’s already unlocked,” I replied quietly.
He turned and grabbed the silver doorknob, carelessly twisting it left, then right, before throwing the door open without any concern for privacy.
I stepped back as Kyle looked up from his phone slowly, taking in full view of the thing that stood in front of him.  In the pitch blackness of the doorway, I could see my prized customer for the first time, in all his deformed, monstrous glory.
The thing stood over six feet tall, its arms longer than its legs, knuckles resting on the wooden floor.  Its face was stark, expressionless, with yellowed eyes coated in translucent film that reflected the porch light.  Its mouth, drawn into a frown, displayed four pronounced fangs that pressed out from its scarred and worn lips.  Its body, covered in hairless, grayed flesh, seemed both emaciated and muscular – like a fighting dog that had been starved just long enough to make it mean.
In one smooth motion, it swept Kyle into its arms as he let out an ear-splitting, primordial death scream, unlike any noise I had ever heard before.  His phone dropped to the ground as the two of them instantly disappeared into the black void of the house.  Just as suddenly as he had screamed, everything was still and silent once more.
“H-hello?” I called into the house from what I figured was a safe distance.  “I did my part.  I brought what you wanted, right?”
The lights inside flickered on.  The foreboding darkness was replaced with the almost welcoming sight of a half-furnished home that still looked as if no one was actually living there.  More to the point, I could see through a short hall and into the dining room, where a single gold coin laid on the bare table.
My tip.
All logical thoughts told me not to go inside.  Definitely not of my own volition.  Every fiber of my being argued against stepping over that threshold and into the pleasantly bland embrace of that refurbished hallway.  Still, these thoughts and feelings could do nothing to stop the steady, mindless progress of my feet as I entered.
I could hear a radio, maybe even a record player, as I nervously walked to the dining room.  Some old-timey classical tune was playing, and I could hear the repeating scratches of a vinyl record that had been played far too many times.
I took a seat at the table and, with trembling hands, lifted the coin.  Again, it was warm to the touch.
“Th-thank you,” I muttered, fulling intending to stand back up and sprint for the door – for safety.
“No,” came a low, rumbling voice from an adjacent room, “thank you.”
I couldn’t tell where the voice had come from.  It seemed to echo and reverberate to the point that the speaker could have been all around me – or even the house itself.
The slow, steady sound of bone knocking against wood followed.  Before long the thing – the tremendous, impossible, dead-looking thing – shuffled through a door frame.  I felt like every lungful of air was sucked out of the room in that instant, and my head began to swim with a mixture of dead and peace.  It was the sort of peace that probably comes over any living thing in the moment when it accepts an unavoidable end.
The thing shuffled its gaunt body to the chair opposite mine and, lifting itself with a wheeze, tucked itself into the seat as best it could, knees to chest.
“W-what…” I stammered.  There were too many ways to end that question.  I couldn’t choose one.
The word that followed answered all of them, but I still didn’t want to hear it.
“Vampire,” it growled.
I felt my head nodding as if this was a completely normal reply.
“I’m sorry it’s not more interesting than that.” the thing… the vampire added.
“No, it’s fine,” I quickly assured, despite the fact it was anything but fine.
“What was in him?” It asked.
Only at that point did I stop staring into its eyes, slimy and unfocused, staring wall-eyed in different directions.  I noticed the absurdly large spatter of fresh blood marking its mouth and dribbling down its chest.
“I don’t know what you mean,” I answered.
“Drugs,” the vampire explained.  “I’m freaking out.”
“Oh, damn, I have no idea.”  I leaned back and thought for a moment.  “We weren’t really friends or anything.”
“Obviously,” it snorted, wiping a viscous swath of human gore from its chin.
The vampire lifted its red-tinged hand and waved me off absently, as if gesturing for me to leave.  It was done with me, for now.  I stood from the table and pushed the chair back in to be polite.  For all I knew, that bit of etiquette was all that stood between a safe departure and getting disemboweled where I stood for being rude.
At the dining-room door, I stopped and turned back toward what had become my favorite customer – though it was definitely by some sort of supernatural force.
“Can I ask you something?”
The vampire turned its head, its neck skin taut and showing pulsing veins full of stolen blood.
“You may, but choose your words carefully.  You may not actually want to know.”
I put the coin into my pocket, where it joined its twin from the previous delivery.
“Why do you need me?” I asked.  “Not that I’m complaining, of course.  You’re obviously a formidable force.  You could easily hunt down and kill your food.  Why call a service and have it brought to you?”
The vampire reached to a nearby counter with one disturbingly long arm and retrieved a smartphone.  One it had no doubt stolen from someone unlucky enough to wander past his door.  Maybe it came from a lost tourist…or perhaps a Jehovah’s Witness.  I had already used up my question, so I didn’t ask.
“This house,” the vampire explained as it marked the last order as complete.  “This is my house.  It always was.  Then, they burned it down around me.  Luckily, I was at rest in a hidden chamber below the basement.  I was hibernating.  By the time I finally awoke, it had been rebuilt.”
“That doesn’t explain why you need me, though…”
“For all intents and purposes, it’s a new house.”  The vampire gestured around itself.  “I’m inside a home…one that nobody invited me into.”
I leaned against the door frame and put a hand to my head, feeling the cold sweat on my brow.
“You’re stuck,” I chuckled.
“Quite,” it replied flatly.
All at once, an idea popped into my head.  A dark, disturbing concept that had no place inside the mind of a normal, civilized person.  I walked back into the room, pulled the chair back out, turned it around, and sat down again, my arms folded over the back of the seat.
“What…if…”
I smiled wickedly.
“What if you paid me to invite you out?”"	9.77	13.0	Christopher Howard “Slimebeast” Wolf	04/28/2021
The CuddL	"The date had been awful.
Their friends looked like they had fun, though. A quadruple date on a day as special as Valentine’s wasn’t anybody’s idea of romance at first, but David, being the talented salesperson he was, made quite convincing points on why it would be amazing. He himself didn’t believe a word he said, but needed the break in his routine desperately enough to persuade. He needed an escape from his love life – an escape through other people.
David and Devon didn’t share a word with each other the entire ride back home. David unlocked the apartment door with an inexplicable urgency.  If he would have shoved the apartment door with the force of four fingers instead of three, he would have hit her straight in the face. He found himself wondering how she would react to be hit in the nose. Would she point it out, or would she just pretend it never happened, like she usually did with things she hadn’t been programmed for?
“I’m taking a bath.”
David grabbed a towel and the bottle of Maker’s Mark 46 he kept hidden in the bookcase. It was a bottle meant for dark days, and judging by the date he had just been on, his day couldn’t get any darker.
The pale brunette looked straight ahead and waited by the door for “the master” to give her a purpose.
“Go to the kitchen and make me tea. After that, go to bed.”
“Do you want me to bring your tea in the bathroom?”
David gave her an annoyed look. She didn’t catch that. Being a 2nd generation model, she wasn’t as sensitive to human emotions as the newer models were.
“No. Leave it on the kitchen table.”
Devon was a functioning humanoid robot, commonly known as a ‘CuddL’. CuddLs had become an essential part of society. They could apply for jobs, make friends and be entrusted with different tasks, whilst always keeping in mind that the sole purpose of their existence was to love and cater to their partner’s every need.
David had had Devon for 9 years. He had been amongst the first to ever purchase a CuddL and now, not even a decade later, almost everybody had one. The people who didn’t have a CuddL either couldn’t afford one, couldn’t purchase one due to their criminal record, or had been happily married since before the CuddL even came on the market.
David cursed the day his childhood nostalgia made him order the Christina Ricci look-a-like instead of an Anna Nicole. Devon was petite and looked somewhat intimidating, yet was anything but that. She knew how to cook, clean, sew and answer in short and concise sentences. She would rarely speak unless spoken to. Reading and writing would have cost David extra, so he went without. Eventually, after two years, David got fed-up with Devon’s simplicity, so he ordered a customized Alexa chip for her, which he made react to the name of ‘Devon’. Devon couldn’t play music like an Alexa could, but she turned into a very good weather forecaster and knew the outcome of every soccer match.
David hated soccer. The Alexa chip hadn’t been a bargain at all. It had cost more than the reading and writing option he passed on the day he ordered her. He had been so stupid. Devon was, by far, the most expensive thing he owned, yet he reached a point where he saw more value in his baths salts than he did in his CuddL.
David used to like submissive women back when he was chubby, ugly and made fun of every day of his life. After he started going to the gym on a regular basis, got promoted at work and purchased a car most passersby whistled after, his taste in women changed. He started preferring fit over skinny – or curvy, either was fine. He preferred tanned over pale skin and sass over shyness. He developed a liking for women who dolled themselves up from head to toe, liked to take charge, knew what they wanted and were not afraid to ask for it. He preferred women…
Devon slipped into his thoughts.
Yeah. As long as they were the complete opposite of Devon, he preferred those women.
As it was to be expected, Xavier and Nate showed up with their respective CuddLs to the date. Xavier had his partner for five years now. Julien, a CuddL 6th generation who, if not for the charging port on his left hip, would pass for human any day of the week. Nate, on the other hand, changed his CuddL every two or three months. He didn’t purchase his CuddL for life, like Xavier and David did, but was paying a monthly subscription for a CuddL service, who let you change your partner as often as you desired…for a small extra fee, of course. The only downside was that you couldn’t customize them. You could only choose them from a catalog, like from a menu.
Nate’s current one was called Krista. She had had 3 other owners before Nate. At first, the very idea of a ‘CuddL for rent’ made David feel sick, but the more Devon’s presence planted its roots and weeds into his life, the more he felt like Nate found the gateway to paradise.
Vicky had surprised everyone tonight. She introduced her friends to her new boyfriend, Bill, and to everybody’s shock, Bill was not what they expected: he was human. He was a human being dating another human being. It wasn’t unheard of, but it had become a very rare phenomenon.
“We met in the parking lot on Martin Luther street,” Bill explained. “She put a dent in my bumper, if you know what I mean.”
Laughter erupted all around the table, save for David, who was too stunned, and Devon, who wasn’t wired for subtlety. Vicky kicked Bill in the shoulder although it was obvious that she enjoyed the joke more than everybody else combined.
“No, for real though, she really did hit my car. I made her have lunch with me, to make it up to me.”
“Wow.” Nate shook his head. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, I think you totally vibe with each other, but… a person our age must be mad to date another human nowadays.”
The group agreed with that statement, kicking it up a notch with synonyms for the word ‘mad’.
“So, like…how does this even work?” David asked the human couple as soon as he snapped out of his astonishment. “Like, who decides what to eat? Who does the wash-up? Who decides which TV programs to watch?”
“Well, we both do.” Bill stretched his arm over the top rail of Vicky’s chair and she took that as an invitation to lean into him.
“Yeah, we take turns.”
“Isn’t it weird, though?” Xavier wanted to know. “Like… before the 2000s, yeah? People would frown at couples like us” – he gestured to Julien and himself – “Know what I mean? Like, after that, they frowned at people dating CuddLs, and now, we’re here, jaws on the floor, because a human found another human to love. Like, what?!”
He verbalized what everybody was thinking. A human dating another human was unheard of in a world where you could design and customize your dream partner. Humans were too unpredictable. Too capricious and moody. Too absorbed with themselves. They could damage their significant other’s day-to-day life through personal routines and habits which wouldn’t match their partner’s at all. How could one find perfection in another person?
“Do you guys, like… hear each other when you go to the bathroom?”
Julien always asked the most inappropriate questions, and Xavier adored him for it. Every human at the table erupted in contagious laughter, earning themselves amused glances from the other couples in the restaurant.
“Babe, you can’t ask that.”
“Oh, come on! Seriously though, do you? ‘Cause, you know, I have no idea what the big fuss is about since I can’t smell anything, but mister over here always makes a big deal out of it.”
Bill and Vicky exchanged a quick glance.
“Don’t you dare,” she warned.
A mischievous grin spread across Bill’s face as he turned to look at the rest of the group.
“She farted in her sleep two nights ago.”
Vicky buried her face in her hands whilst the rest of the table roared with laughter.
David laughed along but could feel the now-familiar bitterness of jealousy boil within himself. Dating another human being…the idea seemed nice. Dating another CuddL…the idea seemed even nicer. Dating another anything. The idea might have given him an erection if Devon wasn’t sitting right beside him.
CuddLs were registered property. A new constitutional annex dictated that no human was allowed to date more than one CuddL at a time, which meant that unless you found a single person willing to take your CuddL off your hands, or you happened to have a subscription plan like Nate, you were stuck with your CuddL forever. The same thing applied in the case of a CuddL’s wellbeing. If something were to happen to it, the current partner was to take full responsibility. CuddLs were also completely off the table for people with any type of history related to violence.
It was then that Vicky decided to change the topic.
“Did you guys hear, some jeweler in Russia tried to open up his CuddL?”
Everybody went quiet.
Xavier took a deep inhale and just as he was about to tell Vicky that her choice of subject was out of line, his CuddL interfered.
“That’s not possible,” Julien grinned.
“I know, but he tried anyway.”
“How?!” Nate’s CuddL, Krista, wanted to know. She spoke in the voice bubblegum would have if it could talk.
“He’s a jeweler.” Vicky shrugged. “I guess he had one of those diamond saws lying around and wanted to see what’s up.”
“Pff, idiot,” Julien continued. “Our skin is made of WBN membrane. This stuff puts Kevlar to shame any day of the week.”
Xavier laughed.
“That’s a bad comparison. Kevlar is super outdated. Haven’t they, like, made better bullet-proof materials since?”
“Not really. They just added some chemical compound found in diamonds to the old thing – but I don’t think it’s as tough as CuddL skin. Not after the 4th generation ones, at least.”
David forced himself to stop thinking about the date.  It was making him angry.  Everything made him angry lately, especially seeing how happy everyone around him was.  He tried emptying his mind in an attempt to enjoy the lingering warmth of the bathwater – it didn’t work.
David took another swig of whiskey. He started to look like a fig, so even though he didn’t exactly feel like it, he had no choice but to get out of the tub. As he brushed his teeth, the thought of getting into his tracksuit and going out for a jog was a lot more appealing than slipping into bed next to Devon – so what if it was 10 p.m. at night, in the middle of February? So what if he just bathed? So what if he was drunk and his girlfriend was waiting for him to come to bed?
David spat toothpaste-foam in the sink with all the hate in the world. He brought the half-empty whiskey bottle back to the bedroom with him. To his surprise, Devon was waiting for him in the doorframe.
“What are you doing? I thought I told you to go to bed.”
“You’re upset.”
David thought he must look like he’d tear the entire apartment down if even his dunce of a CuddL could tell that he’s upset.
“Yes. Move.”
Devon moved out of the way, obedient as ever. David, on the other hand, didn’t. He just stood there, watching her with disgust and pity.
“Why don’t you ever nag?”
Devon looked at him with slightly raised eyebrows. It was as close to a look of confusion as David would ever get.
“Girlfriends nag. It’s what they do! ‘Why do you drink on a weeknight?’, ‘Why do you wear this?’, ‘Why do you do that?’. Why don’t you ever nag?”
David saw a multicolored light draw loops around both of Devon’s irises. She was googling the definition for ‘nag’ through her Alexa chip.
“Devon, stop!”
The lights were gone and David groaned in frustration.
“I’m going out for a jog.”
“Okay.”
David’s fist clenched around the bottleneck.
“I’m going out for a jog on the night of Valentine’s day, instead of spending it with you! And all you have to say is ‘okay’?”
“I want you to be happy.”
“Then, make me happy!”
Devon didn’t even budge. It’s not that she had gotten used to him screaming at her. She didn’t budge the first time either.
“Do you want me to reheat the tea?”
“No.”
“You want something to eat?”
“I already ate, dumbass!”
“Do you want to have sex?”
David didn’t want to go out for a jog, he wanted to run. Run far, far away from this apartment and his life with this poor imitation of a woman.
“Or we can watch Family Guy. That show always makes you happy.”
“No, Devon. It doesn’t make me happy, it just makes me laugh.”
David approached his CuddL and lowered his face to the same level as hers.
“You’re upset,” she tried again.
“You pointed that out already. You’re like a fucking broken record. What are you going to ask me next? Tea? Food? Sex?”
Devon’s eyebrows were slightly raised again.
“Family Guy?”
David screamed. He screamed for almost half a minute, straight into the CuddL’s face. He screamed until tears started rolling down his face.
“You’re upset. I want to help.”
David was shaking so hard, the whiskey in his hand was plopping in the confinements of the bottle.
“You want to help, you sack of metals? Then be somebody else! Be anything else. Disappear from my life or be literally anybody else!”
“I just want you to be happy.”
“And you think I don’t?! That’s what you’re here for! You’re here to make me happy. Like Julien makes Xavier happy. Like Krista makes Nate happy. Like Bill makes Vicky happy. Devon has to make David happy, that’s Devon’s sole purpose! Make. Me. Happy!”
Devon was silent for a second. Then she opened her mouth and closed it again and David saw a multicolored light do another lap around both her irises.
“Happy. Adjective. One. Feeling or showing pleasure or -”
David snapped. He swung the whiskey bottle at Devon’s head so hard, not only did the bottle shatter, but her whole body flew and crashed into the opposite wall. She fell on the floor in a heap of hair and limbs and seeing her like that, made David snap out of his rage.
“Dev?”
Devon moved slightly.
“Oh, god. Devon, baby, I’m sorry.”
“It’s fine. I’m okay.”
David crouched next to her, albeit in no particular hurry. It was redundant to ask her if she’s hurt. CuddLs couldn’t feel pain. David helped his girl sit up and that’s when he saw it.
He was looking at it intently, trying to see if that flicker of blue was really there or just a figment of his imagination. Nate’s words echoed in his mind from somewhere far away, like he had heard them not earlier that night, but sometime between years ago and another life.
~I don’t think it’s as tough as CuddL skin. Not after the 4th generation ones, at least.”~
A gash. There was a gash in Devon’s jaw. There was a 3-inch gash in the jaw of his 2nd generation CuddL and for the first time in years, David felt something very close to love for his girlfriend.
“Oh, Dev.”
The idea had been planted and it was growing rapidly. It grew roots, leaves, and branches, spreading everywhere, leaving no lucid thought uninfected. David took his partner’s face in his hands. She smiled.
“Do you love me?”
“I do.”
He kissed her then, for the first time in months. She threw her arms around his neck, trying to deepen the kiss, but always letting him be the one in control.
“How much do you love me?”
“There is nothing and nobody I love more than you.”
Of course there wasn’t.
“Good.”
David reached behind himself and took one of the biggest shards he could find splattered on the carpet. He should have thought about doing this years ago. Devon looked at the shard but said nothing.
“If you really love me, you’re going to stay still and be quiet until I’m done. Understand?”
Devon raised her big brown eyes at him. If David didn’t know any better, he would have said that she was about to cry.
“Will this… make you happy?”
David wanted to jump out of his skin, he was so giddy.
“Yes. This is the one thing that will make me very happy.”
That was all she needed to know. Devon leaned against the wall, let her hands drop to her sides and head loll on her left shoulder. Robot or not, she didn’t want to see what David was about to do to her.
David situated himself between her legs and started working through the fabric of her blouse and undershirt. He could have gotten the big scissors or a knife, sure, but he was too impatient to see it done. Devon’s chest lay bare beneath his fingers before he even knew it. She didn’t budge. Hell, she didn’t even blink when David sunk the shard of glass in the soft space between her clavicles, hard enough to slit. It was messy. The skin was no WBN membrane, but it was tough stuff nonetheless.
Devon didn’t look as David barbered her thoracic cavity open. David would have taken dozens of pictures if the action he was performing wasn’t highly illegal.
Devon’s insides were a modern-day miracle. It was all epic braids of wires, cogs, gears, metal plaques, clamps and tension discs. There was also a gooey substance that imitated cookie dough but had the same color and smell of motor oil. David didn’t feel like disassembling everything, because he didn’t know how CuddLs worked and if that self-defense system they had, was myth or reality. David simply knew that in case of extreme emergency – like this one – a CuddL could send an SOS to its national base and ask for help. But Devon wouldn’t do that. He knew it. As long as this was what made him happy, she was willing to go along with it.
It made David almost like her again. Almost.
David looked around. He wasn’t very savvy with electronics, but his general smarts were supposed to pinpoint a certain wire, a certain motor that connected everything to everything else and which, through removal, would result in a complete system shutdown.
Both of them were silent. David had nothing left to say to her and Devon, even though she was an android, knew all too well that her end was near. He’ll shut her off and hide her somewhere beneath the floorboards of his cellar. Friends will ask questions and the day he’ll be found out will probably come along too, but he’ll deal with that when the time is due.
Right now, he has a CuddL to kill.
Something was off. David could have missed it, but the more he stared into Devon’s open chest, the clearer it became. The wires were moving rhythmically. David thought it was probably just the electric energy that was still running through her, but as he looked closer he realized, that that’s not it. Behind the wires crisscrossing in the middle of her chest, was something that looked like a plastic bag. With probably useless care, David moved the wires to the side for a better look. That’s when Devon winced slightly and David understood why.
“Oh, my fucking god.”
In the middle of her chest, sealed to protect it from the rest of the device, was a beating heart. A beating human heart. That heart was the core of the entire finite network that was Devon. It was what closed the circuit-system. The heart was perforated in three places by hoses and there was no doubt in David’s mind that one of those was, somehow, connected to the AC power cord attached to Devon’s back.
It was an extraordinary piece of work. He should have known that there had to be something human about these machines but fascinated as he was, it was nowhere near enough to deter him from his goal.
It was all too simple. He knew what needed to be done to get it over with. David let the shard drop next to Devon’s leg and reached behind himself in search of the bottleneck. It was perfect. One powerful stroke with the broken side and it would all be over. He welcomed the loneliness that was to come. He welcomed the sweet high that was to be freedom.
“What the…”
He wouldn’t have seen it if he impaled her heart straight away. There was something attached to the heart, piercing through the transparent film somewhere at the base of one of the hoses. David leaned in for a closer look.
It was tiny and difficult to read, but David recognized what it was. It was a switch. The side it was switched to said ‘Devon’ in cheap letter stickers. The other side had a tiny piece of metal with “1056.B” engraved on it. David had the bottleneck set in position. His left hand was encircled around it and the palm of his right hand was resting against the mouth, just waiting to hammer the glass into the kernel of Devon’s existence.
Suddenly, the idea that had planted itself into David’s head stopped its expansion and shrunk just enough to let other tiny ideas slip through.
There was a switch within Devon. Devon, as he knew her, had been activated by the flip of a switch. And that’s when it occurred to David, that everything he hated about Devon – everything he had come to deeply and truly loathe about his partner – were the exact same features he had chosen her for. He had to wonder… was this a saving grace? The other side of the switch was neither bare, nor did it say ‘off’, but was rather a carefully crafted piece of metal which, compared to Devon’s poorly attached letters, bore the promise of a new personality. New temper. New anything.
Was this a second chance for them? Could he actually wipe away the pre-settings he had once believed in? If he could just reset her, start fresh, could he learn to love her and live with it? He said so himself before – he’d be happy if Devon would either disappear or become anybody else.
That did it. David flipped the switch.
“Ouch!”
The small electric discharge pinched David’s thumb. Devon’s heart picked up the pace and her hands began to twitch. Then came the plethora of various micro-expressions – expressions that had been nothing short of foreign to her face for the past 9 years. David was ecstatic.
“Devon? Honey, can you hear me?”
Devon turned her head to look at David. She seemed out of it. Like she had just woken up from a drunken slumber, not having yet slept off the alcohol in her system. Her head fell forward and she began to study her hands like they were the most amazing things she had ever laid eyes on.
“Can you hear me, Devon?”
Devon huffed. She touched her face. She let out a chuckle and raised her head to look at David again. She began to laugh whilst still touching her face and the sound was so liberating, David laughed along with her. They laughed like idiots for a minute or more.
“Yes. I can hear you.”
The shard of glass David had opened Devon’s chest with, was then lodged into his neck with so much force, it made a clean cut through his right carotid artery. David went wide-eyed and opened his mouth to say something, but all that came out was blood and gurgles.
Devon watched David suffer as he bled to death on the carpet and as soon as she knew for certain that he was dead, she began searching the house for a sewing kit, to stitch herself back together.
David was right. By flipping the switch, Devon had become somebody else entirely. She had become a death row inmate with the number 1056.B who, according to public records, had been killed no less than 20 years prior. He liked the name Devon, though. It went well with his new carcass, so he guessed he could keep it. Along with the pronouns. It would make things easier in the long run.
After patching herself up, getting dressed and packing her bags, Devon grabbed David’s car keys and gave him one last look before leaving their home of 9 years forever. This felt right. She connected to her original heart, without the settings or constrictions, and even though she was looking at a bled-out corpse on the floor, she felt nothing but happiness.
The heroine had been asleep for two decades, to be awakened by a charming prince on Valentine’s Day. Devon chuckled.
If this wasn’t romance, she didn’t know what it was."	9.64	11.0	Lucretia Vastea	04/26/2021
Red Earth	"There were only a few select things in this world that Corbin Reef hated more than lazy college professors.  Give me a hardass who’ll break you down before midterms, he would say; at least that would show they cared about the class.
Corbin was a first-year Environmental Studies major at Lasich College.  His choice of study was merely elementary, being the son of an alternative energy engineer father and a marine biologist mother, both of whom were heavy hippies in the late Vietnam War era.
His first semester in uni was going along well enough; he packed his schedule with GE credits and one prerequisite class for his major: Intro to Environmental Studies. Corbin didn’t care much for the other courses; they were all easy B’s at worst.  What he wanted to devote most of his time to was the intro class.  However, he didn’t do enough research into the class or who was running it because as he soon found out in his first week, he was stuck with Prof. Slugworth, the laziest tenured professor on campus, for the next seventeen weeks.
Prof. Slugworth didn’t hate his job; rather, he was an animal biologist and didn’t find much enjoyment outside of his field.  He would rather spend time on his research papers or writing his new book than teach a class full of students who didn’t want to be there.  Weeks passed, and while Corbin’s other classes were gearing up for the first wave of midterms, Slugworth’s class was chugging along at an excruciatingly tedious pace.  Corbin woke up one morning to an email sent to his student account.  It was from Slugworth.  Its subject was “Class Canceled,” and it simply said: “Class is canceled today.  Watch the documentary ’Barren Earth’ and we’ll have a discussion tomorrow.”  Even his emails were lazy!  There was no salutation at the end, no links to the assignment, nothing to help him out.  He found a discussion on the online board where his classmates were just as confused.  He learned that the documentary was available on several streaming platforms, but it cost money.  There was speculation that Slugworth chose this specific documentary because he was earning incentives for making his students buy the movie.
Corbin decided he was going to spite his good-for-nothing professor and get the movie for free.  He texted his friend Rami, a computer science major, and said: “I’ve got a favor.”
“Good morning to you too, dickhead,” Rami responded almost immediately.
Corbin ignored his friend’s jab.  “I need you to download a movie for me.”
“What kind of movie we talking about?”
“A nature documentary, get your head outta the gutter.”
“You want it downloaded legally, or…”
“The other option, Einstein.”
“Hey, I don’t want my FBI agent to catch onto my antics.  Why can’t you do it?”
“Because I’ll catch a virus or something if I try.”
“Here’s a tip: don’t be stupid.  Pretty simple if you ask me.”
Corbin groaned on the inside.  He was running late for his nine o’clock calculus class, so he had to seal the deal fast.
“C’mon, man. Throw me a bone, why don’t you?”
“What’s in it for me?”
“You know that hot chick in our English 1A class?”
“The brunette with the huge cans?”
“That’s the one.”
“What about her?”
“I got her number.”  Corbin waited for Rami’s response.  At this rate, he was going to end up late, but attendance wasn’t mandatory for his first class.  The three dots popped up, vanished, then popped up again like a skittish weasel.
“Don’t lie to me, man,” he said.
“I’d never lie to you,” Corbin responded.  “And I’ll send it to you if you get me the movie.”
“Deadass?”
“Deadass.”
“How’d you even get it?”
“Prof asked us to get contact information from different classmates.  I already knew you, so I tried swinging for the fences.”
“And it worked?”
“You think I’d let a pretty face like mine go to waste?”
“Don’t get cocky, kid,” Rami texted.  “But you got yourself a deal.”
Corbin breathed a sigh of relief and relaxed.  He slipped his phone in his pocket, snatched his bag, threw on some shoes, and grabbed a protein bar on his way out of the dorms.
* * * * * *
It was well past seven, and night had fallen fast and hard, like a flashlight lowered into a deep cavern.  Corbin had spent his time after classes on campus, looking for part-time jobs, catching up for midterms, and spending an hour with a study group.  He returned to his single-occupancy dorm room and booted his laptop.  Rami had sent an email with an .mp4 attachment.  The subject said: “A deal’s a deal, now send them digits!”  The body said: “Took me a while to find it.  It’s safe to download, I tried it myself. -R.”  Even if Rami tested it himself, Corbin didn’t want to take a chance with his new laptop he got as a graduation gift.  He ran a virus detection scan on the file, and it came up clean.  He clicked the attachment and saved it to his desktop, where he opened it up in a video player.  Before pressing play, he grabbed a bag of corn chips, his hydroflask full of vitamin water, and leaned back in his seat.
The documentary opened with a sweeping landscape of a wide ocean, stretching off far past the horizon and chasing low hanging clouds.  The camera floated above the world then took a nosedive into the deep blue waters where schools of fish and vast coral reefs dotted the ocean floor like ants on a polka-dotted picnic blanket.  A voice picked up suddenly, narrating the fantastic views as the camera swam along with the sea life.
“There is a world that’s been out of reach, until now.  Two worlds lie on either side of a crystalline barrier, thinner than a sheet of paper.”
Sweeping orchestrals accompany several tight nature shots.  Fish swam in the ocean.  Birds flew through dry air.  A frog sat idly on a lonesome lily pad.  The narration continued.  “One world is older, beautiful, and sophisticated.  The other lies above the waters, a younger world that is secretive, tougher, different.  Little in these two sister worlds is as it appears.  This is a story of a consummation between the land and the sea, where miracles and devastation lie around every facet of life.
“We first start our journey into the briny depths of the sea, where life as we know it stood witness to a grand display of evolution.”  The camera panned up and out, flying past the stratosphere high above the Earth, where nothing but deep blue water circled the globe, save for two disks of white in the ice caps.  “Millions of years ago, the Earth was blue, a barren landscape on the surface, but underneath it was teeming with life.”  Pockets of green began to sprout out from the blue expanse like bobbing apples.  “Then slowly the sea levels died down bit by bit,” the narrator said, “and a new world was introduced, one with brilliant new colors and sights to behold: land.”
Corbin thought the CGI was incredibly well done.  They showed the starting formation of Pangea and the continents that would break off from their mother supercontinent.  The narrator went on.  “Over the next few epochs of time, creatures followed an unseen destiny to this new world, guided only by their instincts.  But only a tiny portion made the land their home, while the vast majority of life decided to stick to their roots, so to speak.  Thus, the planet was split in half, with one world thriving on dry land and the other prospering in the sea.  Both worlds collide and clash, and their past relationships, as well as their present, are part of this story.”
The camera swung around the Earth in a wide arc, with the sun and stars spiraling in all directions.  Then it got closer and soon fell into orbit, flying low through the puffy white clouds and finally skimming above the ocean once more.  A thin line of beige lined the horizon, and the camera came to a beach.
“We see here,” the narrator continued, “the bridge between worlds: the coastline.  And underneath the very tips of the surface are the edges of land fringed with coral that disappear into the depths.”  Corbin saw great fingers of cyan laced with veins of deep teal coral.  Majestic music played in the background.  “The reef is a jeweled city perched on the clifftop.  It’s a community with amazing relationships between animals.”
There was a gathering of bright yellow fish with black, spotted gills, surrounded by several smaller thin black fishes.  “Fifteen-centimeter slippery dicks,” the narrator continued, Corbin chuckled to himself, “groom large moon wrasses, even combing the tender gills.  They eat any parasites and dead skin, a reward for their trouble.”
The camera switched to a discolored yellow fish, evidently one of the moon wrasses.  Its skin was covered in sores, and its gills were inflamed with red.  “This sickly fellow is being tended to by a myriad of dicks.”  Corbin stifled a laugh even though it wasn’t as funny anymore.  “They are trying to find the root of the problem.  Signs of infection are emanant on this poor moon wrasse, and it won’t be long until it succumbs to its disease.”  One of the dicks violently thrashes at a spot around the wrasse’s face, then pulls a plump insectile thing from the skin.  “Ah, here we are!  A lucky dick has found the parasite, hidden just above the eyeball.  It’s a large specimen, by the looks of it.  The slippery dick relishes in its hard work, and leaves the wrasse be, and the others follow suit soon after.”  The camera panned out to find large, ominous shadows taking the place of those miniscule slippery dicks.  “Unfortunately for the moon wrasse, the lucky discovery was too little too late, and several predators take this opportunity to feast on a hearty meal.”
Just before the mysterious sea creatures lunge for the kill, the scene changed.  It showed a handsome brown eel hiding in a patch of coral.  The narrator took charge: “The African moray eel, the five and a half meter dragon of the reef, is attended by shrimps.  They enter the jaws of death to keep razor-sharp teeth clean in exchange for any morsels they find.  No opportunity is wasted, however desperate it may seem.”  The eel opened its mouth wide and snapped its jaws in excitement, catching one of the shrimps in its maw.  The scene changed again.
“Devilfish hide in an anemone, protected by tentacles that would paralyze other bigger, more dangerous fish.”  Corbin watched as tiny beautiful fish with hues of blue and deep orange hid in the bulbous sea plants.  “An anemone can close,” said the narrator, “and the local clownfish is finding his home a tight squeeze.”
The camera panned over to a larger anemone.  Unlike the previous ones, this plant had blue skin on the outside and barbed tentacles.  The narrator explained the situation: “The faux anemone, actiniaria imponere, is a carnivorous sea plant that looks and acts like a regular sea anemone.  It attracts smaller fish to its vessel, letting them live and thrive in their tentacle-like teeth.  And when a bigger fish imposes itself on the smaller fish and decides to move in, the faux anemone makes its move.”  A clownfish nudged several devilfish out of the anemone and tries to settle in, only for the opening to close suddenly, and the fish disappears.  “It snatches the unsuspecting bully, and closes its mouth, digesting its food.”  Corbin saw as the anemone made quick work of the clownfish, and whatever else was unlucky enough to get caught alongside its primary victim.  A fine layer of what looked like sand got kicked up underneath the anemone.  The narrator continued: “It releases waste particles around its body that are rich in iron, phosphate, and nitrogen, letting sea vegetation grow around it and inviting other species of fishes to set up shop, ignorant of the terrifying predator lurking in plain sight.  Indeed, relationships like these can have difficult moments.”
The scene changed.  The camera flew past a white-grained sandy beach to a jungle of sorts.  “These underwater communities,” the narrator said, “lie along the shores of ancient human settlements, where the cradle of modern mathematics, medicine, science, and technology were nurtured.  We now journey to the world of land, where we come across a wide and boundless forest in the heart of what was known as Asia.  Over half of all the world’s trees, evergreen and deciduous, stand in these great assemblies.  For many of us, they are places of mystery and darkness.  They are key to our climate, and home to countless unique species.”
Quick consecutive shots of burning trees, barren land, and displaced animals filled the screen while the narration picked back up.  “In the past, we have destroyed them without hesitation.  Yet, forests do have an astounding ability to recover.”
The camera switched to a scenic landscape shot, where mountains of white-tinged trees roll toward frigid waters.  “Take, for example, this luscious location, the southern edge of the boreal forest.  The forest that has held dominion over the far north for thousands of years, but there was once a time when its long reign was threatened by flooding and mass extinction following a great Calamity.  It has since found a resurgence of both life and balance.”
An aerial shot at sunset, with tendrils of dying light stretching over thin tree trunks that looked like hairs on a snow-white head.  “It stretches eastwards across a great continent for thousands of kilometers, and now, in the middle of a harsh winter, where young lakes and rivers are freshly frozen over, it’s largely silent, seemingly empty of animals of any kind.”
“But this is the home of an animal so rare, it’s almost mythical.”  Soft violins play as the camera switches to the ground.  Snowy rocks surround loosely green-leafed trees.  The picture is still, then a bright orange head arises behind a bluff, shouldering a massive feline body behind it over freshly fallen snow.  “A Siberian tiger,” the narrator explains.  “There are fewer than 300 of them in the wild.  These are the most intimate pictures of them in the wild that we have imagined.”  Corbin could hear the tiger panting heavily.  Warm puffs of air sprouted from its mouth and mingled with the trees.  A crow cawed in the distance and the tiger growled at it. Up close, Corbin could see its definitive black stripes and white undertones near its belly.
The narrator went on: “A male Siberian tiger patrols a territory of nearly 800 square kilometers, and it has to do so if it is to find enough prey to keep itself alive during the long winter.  Ancient instinct compels it to search in a wider berth, approximately two thousand square kilometers, but lakeshores and ocean water impose as obstacles upon its quest.  This is an impoverished land, where food of any kind is scarce.”
A quick aerial shot, followed by a bird perched on the ground.  The camera showed it pecking at a bundle of nuts.  “A pinecone,” said the narrator.  “Pine nuts provide vital energy during the winter months.”  Corbin watched as something big and furry sauntered between bare bushes and thick trunks.  The bird flew away.  “Wild boar depend on these nuts.  For them, it has to be grab-and-go, for they themselves are food for a tiger.”  The boar scampered away as the tiger got near, and the camera showed the big cat slowly follow after it.  “This game of hide-and-seek is played out over vast areas of forest, as all animals search for the life-giving stands of pine.”
A closer aerial shot, where the camera tracked the tiger as it stalked its prey.  “Sudden changes to their habitat, as well as the introduction of a new, more ferocious predator, have made the Siberian tiger nearly extinct.  But since the late 60s, their numbers have slowly been increasing.”
The camera changed back to the forest floor, where fresh tracks were scattered around a large pile of broken pinecones.  The narration picked up as Corbin saw a wild boar taking its sweet time with its food.  “Here we see a banquet of nuts, dropped by a pregnant pine tree.  A herd of boars has been through here, although one remains, electing to stay behind while the others move on to avoid danger.”  The tiger lowers its body close to the ground, eyes forward, head low beneath the bare bushes.  “The male tiger creeps low and silent in the underbrush, the packed snow underneath its heavy paws muffle the sound of his approach.”  Corbin watched the wild pig eat as if nothing is amiss.  He had a hand halfway in his chip bag, his hydroflask sitting untouched on his desk.  He was enraptured.  The music picked up pace and intensity as the narrator continued.  “The boar suspects nothing before it is too late.”
The tiger pounced.  The boar squealed and tried to get away, but the big cat clamped its paws around its midriff and sank his teeth into the jugular as the music reached a crescendo.  The snow soaked in fresh red as the narrator spoke.  “The tiger’s days of effort are rewarded as he finds his first meal in quite some time.  He lets out a mighty roar of triumph, although it will prove to be short-lived.  For you see, the boar and tiger share some commonalities, such as their tendency to make their meals ‘to-go’ before they find themselves the main course.”
As if punctuated by those last few words, Corbin felt a sense of dread settle over him.  Not the kind of dread you’d feel watching a suspenseful movie, but the kind of feeling that told the body that something wasn’t right anymore.  He felt watched.  The music had stopped its lovely number.  It didn’t taper off or slow down; it just stopped like a door slamming closed.  Corbin thought the video had paused, but the tiger kept moving through the silence.  This wasn’t normal.  As the tiger kept eviscerating its prey, the dread built more on top of Corbin.  There was something in the video, something dangerous, not just to the tiger but to himself.  He just couldn’t see it.
A noise, like a whip moving through the air before the crack.  Its source was unknown in the video.  Then the tiger was dragged back into the tree line.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving its prized meal unattended.  Then silence again, nothing moved.  When the narrator spoke, it was like a wall crashing down.
“Mother nature cries out in pain as another member of a rare and beautiful species meets a grisly end.”
The shot faded to black, then the camera was above the ocean once more.  This time, Corbin didn’t feel that same sense of childlike wonder.  He was disturbed beyond words.  Music began to swell again, and the narrator spoke as if nothing happened.  “We return to the sea, where the dust of history has settled into the rising waters as sand, rock, and mud.  Off the coast of what was known as Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf, the sea is like a hot tub; it gets hotter and saltier than any other open sea in the world.  It’s surprising that corals can survive; they have miraculously found ways to cope, much to the excitement of sea life.”
Deeper down, the camera showed coral reefs with muted colors.  What once was so vibrant and lively to Corbin, the coral reefs no longer touched him with the same amount of fascination.  The narrator continued.  “It’s different from other coral reefs in the world; this is more like a bombed-out city, devastated by heat and salt.”  The camera followed a small valley filled on both sides with dilapidated rocks, crumbling coral, and gray vegetation.  “And in some cases,” he said, “there are quite literally cities sprouting from the ocean floor, rusted beyond repair and taken over by sea life of all kinds.”  Then the valley dropped off, and there in the distance was an Atlantean city.  Skyscrapers reached up and poked through the water’s surface like rustic buoys.  The streets diced up the city into chunks of crusted square meat.  This cannot be real, Corbin thought, yet it looked real enough.  A lost city in the middle of the ocean.  Corbin asked himself, not for the first time, when this documentary was captured.
The narrator went on.  “Small squid begin to dance along cracked asphalt, courting in a psychedelic language of hues and colors.  Life in all its wonderful forms will emerge in the Gulf, though it’s never obvious.
“Reefs here are small and isolated.  Submerged sandy plains are an extension of the Arabian desert, but here underwater, rocks turn into cuttlefish on closer inspection.  Fan worms cast their nets, mimicking flowers on the sidewalk.  A devious eye and a gill belong to a ray, who takes his sweet time cruising down the avenue.”  The camera moved just outside the city limits, where great swaths of muted green filled the seafloor. “Thousands of square kilometers of sand have been colonized by seagrass.  The underwater meadows may not look like much, but this is one of the most productive habitats on Earth.  Its riches are hard to see.”
Thin lines of what looked like grassy roots swam by onscreen. The narrator explained, “Shrimp fish look and act like floating seagrass.”  The camera showed a bulbous, bug-eyed fish hiding in a secluded shallow pit.  “Sandy stargazers hide in holes.”
The camera cut to a large snake lurking along the grassy sand dunes.  Its emotionless eyes stared off into the distance.  “A six-meter striped sea snake,” said the narrator, “is one of the most venomous creatures in the world, with over ten times a rattler’s killing power.  He hunts fish like little stargazers.”
The snake slithered along, finding a gaping hole.  It struck, a terrifying thrust even submerged in water.  “Got one!”  It wandered a few feet and struck again.  “And another!  The annulated sea snake eats heartily this evening, and rightfully so to maintain its massive body.”
The snake looked titanic compared to the small fish that swim around it. The camera panned to a wide shot where Corbin could see its full length.  Then a chill ran down his spine when a hulking shadow loomed far away near the city.  It moved slowly, almost lethargically.  It inspired a deeply welled fear inside Corbin, the kind of fear he first felt when he saw a picture of Jupiter, its astronomical size making him feel small and insignificant especially when contrasted against the black void of space.  The narrator spoke up.  “However, far across the coral reefs where the drop off takes a plunge into darkness, we see a gargantuan leedsichthys, well over thirty meters in length.  It overshadows the now meek and mild sea snake, making the latter look more like a thread of clothing than a terrifying monster.”
The camera cut away, and none too soon, for Corbin would have turned off the video out of the intangible fear he had experienced.  How many things like that were lurking in the water this instant?  He had discovered a newfound fear of the ocean today.  The narrator continued.  “If the coral reefs are cities abundant with life and culture, then there are bound to be menaces to these miniature societies.”  A long, thin shark swam past the camera, with fins like icebergs.  “A four-meter whitetip reef shark is recognized and feared.  She is the monarch of the elite overworld who flaunts her power and might wherever she goes.”
Then the camera showed a dark cloud of large fish, clustered together in a sinister pack.  The narrator explained: “A gathering of giant barracuda near nightfall are gangsters of the seedy underbelly, casting a shadow over the reef.  Barracuda gather in hundreds by the drop-off.  They’re waiting for evening.”  Corbin watched as they began to swim round and round each other, slowly and methodically creating a barrier.  “The nocturnal pack hunters form the wheel of death, ready to tear apart anything that moves or breathes.  Schools of fish bob and weave when they sense the danger, but some wander too closely and are dragged into the circle, and the center collapses.”  True to the narrator’s words, a plump fish fell into the barracudas’ radar, and the spinning wheel shuts closed like an eyeball.  The frenzy in the water lasted a few seconds, and then Corbin saw that the wheel reformed effortlessly.
The camera pulled up and away from the water to the air.  The scene changed, and feathered wings filled the screen.  “The world of flight belongs to the birds.”  Corbin stared from an aerial view as tiny white specks filled up a small island.  A closeup of the birds showed that they have plump bodies and thin wings and feet.  A long beak protruded from their faces.  The narrator went on.  “Here we see nearly half a million Callao shag, three-quarters of the world population.  These fascinating birds breed here on the island of Callao in what was known as South America.  Featherless chicks shiver each morning; nights are cold here.  Life in the colony is dangerous, loud, and smelly.  Young chicks are of various ages, and the older ones hang out in gangs.  The younger chicks still need babysitters.  Everyone is hungry.”
The camera filled with squawking, squabbling birds.  There were many flying through the air, many more dotting the desolate ground.  “Gulls attack undefended chicks, because they can find little food elsewhere.  Even cannibalism is common.”  To emphasize this, a fully feathered shag snatched a small chick on camera and gobbled it whole.  The mother chased after the deviant bird.  “The females are all white-feathered, and do their best to protect their young.  It is an uphill battle.  Temperatures swing from too cold to too hot in a few hours.  Birds can’t sweat, and pant desperately to keep cool.  There’s no shade and no food.”
Piles of whitish, yellow bones littered some of the ground.  Corbin was horrified to see that some skulls closely resembled those of a human.  “Gulls and shags peck at bones and the remains of a lost civilization, but still find nothing to satiate their hunger.”
The camera pointed to the horizon, where something far away was approaching fast.  “Salvation appears first as a thin black line,” the narrator explained.  The music swelled with hopeful energy.  “After a morning’s fishing, tens of thousands of black-feathered males return to the colony with food.  The first problem for families is to find each other.”  The air was full of chittering birds, and Corbin watched as the females scrambled around to find their partner.  “The lucky ones are fed quickly.  But they better be careful, because the inside of a Callao shag’s mouth is lined with hundreds of needle-like teeth.  Feeding time is a precise yet quick excursion, and can turn messy in a flash.”  Corbin saw a white-feathered mother suddenly pull away from her mate, finding her head covered with gashes.  She went back for more.
“Some females,” the narrator said, “are impatient, and attempt to exhort a handsome passerby trying to look for his family.”  The camera showed a female waddling up to a male and putting a thin wing around his waist like a drunken barfly trying to pick up a much younger woman on the town.  “If the female is too persistent, or if the male is annoyed enough, he’ll bite her head off.”  Corbin stared as the miffed black-feathered male opened its mouth wide, showing slim glittering teeth, and tore the female’s head off her neck.  A red river spilled onto the sand.  The camera cut away quickly.
“After all that,” the narrator continued, “the last thing you want is to be mugged for the only meal of the day.  Hungry shags and reef herons wait until chicks are being fed, then swoop in.”  Fights broke along the shoreline.  Corbin saw that the shags had a hard time defending both their young and their dinner from greedy herons.  More heads topple, and wings were pulled free from their sockets.  Corbin could only stare transfixed and unmoving in a sort of horrid fascination.
“Just when you thought it couldn’t get any tougher, the wind becomes a sandstorm.  Sand, dirt, and blood are blown across the island and into the sea.  The timing could not have been more unfortunate, for the blood begins to attract hordes of sand spiders.”  The camera showed piles of sand moving fast along the shore and into the midst of the small island, where they approached the fighting birds.  Then the spiders burst through the surface.  They were big and fat with bulbous abdomens and long slender legs, the biggest spiders Corbin had ever seen, real or imaginary, as big as full-grown basset hounds.
“These fast and deadly arachnids live underneath the surface of long sandbars and isolated islands.”  The narrator didn’t skip a beat.  “It just so happens that they were lying in wait underneath an all-you-can-eat buffet.  It is an absolute massacre.  The colony is decimated within minutes.  The lucky ones abandon their young and flee for another strip of land.  There are some shags who are too injured to fly, and they limp into the sea past the coral reef, where gangster barracuda extend their wheel of death and the center folds once again.”
Corbin was only momentarily aware that he had dropped his bag of chips to the floor.  He wasn’t hungry anymore. The scene changed to a tall forest canopy, and the narrator kept speaking.  “Nothing is as it seems in the animal kingdom, both in the sea and on land.  Hidden in the vegetation of the moist redwood forest floor is a richly populated underworld.  Male rough-skinned newts are driven by a mysterious urge to return to the pool where they hatched as tadpoles.  And they need to get there quickly.  Not only is the competition always fierce, but predators lurk around every corner of the forest floor.”
The yellow-tinged newts crawled infuriatingly slowly across the screen, dragging their flat bodies across wet dirt and slippery logs.  Then without warning, several bristly prongs sprung up from the ground and wrapped around a newt, dragging it down underneath the soil.  “One very unlucky newt falls victim to the trapdoor beetle’s ploy, and is gobbled up quickly.  The rest veer around the newly formed pit, learning from their fallen comrade’s mistake.  And yet, as they will soon learn, this was never planned to be an isolated incident.”  Columns of dirt blow up as more legs spring up and attack in front of the camera.  The beetles must’ve been huge if they were big enough to grapple an adult newt.  “One by one,” said the narrator, “many more are plucked from underneath the ground by long insectile legs, and the moist dirt lying below the quaint forest canopy turns into a minefield.  Only a small percentage make it to the pond, where females lie in waiting for a suitable mate.  The mating ritual of rough-skinned newts can take up to several hours, and night falls quickly in these parts.  However, unbeknownst to the amicable amphibians, a new enemy makes his grand debut.”
The camera panned from the peaceful pond to a tree nearby.  A grotesque bug crawled out from the roots.  Corbin recoiled from his monitor; the thing made him physically sick to look at it.  “A purple spined centipede scuttles out of its hiding place.  A terrifying sight to look at, it shortly proves itself to be far more dangerous than your wildest imaginations.  It finds the water’s edge and spits into it, turning the once serene pond toxic within seconds.  The newts are cooked alive underwater, and their bloated bodies float to the surface, giving off a horrid stench that is unappealing to any creature except the purple spined centipede.  Eventually, the corpses will make their way to the edge of the pond, where the centipede gorges itself on fresh meat for hours.  Once it is finished, it will go into a quick hibernation, and it won’t be searching for another meal for several months.”  The great monstrosity went back into its hiding hole and the camera cut to black momentarily.  Corbin’s eyes were soon ambushed with a flurry of disturbing images accompanied by discordant music.  Giant lobsters stripping apart the tender flesh of a beached whale.  An orange furred tarantula crawling out of a human skull.  A raven with a moist eyeball in its beak sitting atop a mountain of discarded bones in the middle of an arid desert.  The music tore apart at his ears; the notes were disorganized, pitched too deep with incredibly shrill whines.  He shut his eyes at the onslaught and only opened them when the narrator spoke again.
“Animals of all shapes and sizes pose a threat to certain creatures, even on a microscopic level.”  The camera had switched scenes back to a forest floor.  It showed a large beet-red larva of some sort crawling along slowly.  Only when it passed a tiny acorn did Corbin understand how big this creature really was.  “Here we see a sickly fellow. The behemoth caterpillar is usually a robust and lively specimen, but this one is dying from an unseen predator.  It is infected with a virus, a rather deadly one at that.  The F. vrasmosrumpere virus is a nasty bug that heats up the body temperature of a host well past its capable limits.  All stored fat is used up and burned to generate more heat, causing the insides to literally melt and boil until…”
The poor caterpillar onscreen exploded from the inside, splitting its lumpy body in half and spilling chunks of rancid flesh everywhere.  “The skin ruptures, and the poor caterpillar is split in two.  The stench of raw meat attracts birds and insects, where they peck and tear at the still-living creature until it is nothing but a husk.  Little do these ravagers know that by eating the flesh of the caterpillar they have infected themselves with the boiling virus, and the cycle continues.  The F. vrasmosrumpere virus can be contracted by most animals, spreading through exposed blood and bodily fluids, making it the deadliest and most violent virus on the planet.  And yes, it is infectious to humans.”
The camera panned back, and Corbin saw a CGI rendering of the entire globe, but it was not a world he recognized.  The entire eastern half of Europe was underwater.  Many of the southern states and midwest of America were completely flooded.  A huge lake sat in the middle of Africa.  Massive islands formed in the middle of huge continents.  It was an alien atlas, a world Corbin could not understand nor fully comprehend.
The narrator spoke up.  “But the horror does not stop there, for the world as we know it has steadily taken a trip back in time, where prehistoric-like animals roam freely.”  The images Corbin had seen thus far were only the beginning.  The documentary kept playing, showing a cascade of unending horror.  A herd of heliocoprion, with jaws like a sea urchin, prowling the darkest depths of the ocean.  A titanoboa swallowing a macaque monkey whole.  Disease-ridden millipedes festering over a decaying corpse.  Crocodiles as long as basketball courts hunting along a shallow river bank.  A hive of hornets making a honeypot out of the abdomen of a dying ox.  Corbin didn’t have the courage to check and see how much time was left in the movie.
Then there were the things he couldn’t unsee.  Colossal lumbering mammoths, taller than ethereal treetops.  A bipedal lizard hominid that feasted on wild goats and sheep.  A great wolf with drooling teeth and dark eyes.  Small monkey-like creatures that tore apart their prey with vicious speed.  A mngwa, a feline hyena hybrid, stalking the African Serengeti.  The terrors were unceasing, and Corbin could not force his eyes away.
“It is uncertain where all of these unearthly beasts appeared, but scientists have a relative understanding.”  The camera cuts to an aerial view, where a great ice blanket covers everything in sight.  “Believe it or not,” the narrator continues, “this is the north pole.  A large sheet of ice is all that remains of the polar ice caps.  Both the northern and southern ice caps used to house over two percent of all water in the world, compacted into ice and snow.  But frozen water was not all that lay underneath the tundra.”  The camera cut to beneath the ice.  Corbin saw animals of all shapes and colors, petrified like still-life paintings.  “A prehistoric world, frozen in time long forgotten.  When the rains of Calamity came down from the atmosphere, it sheared the ice shelves and melted the caps, releasing these monstrous beasts onto the world.  They migrated through the glaciers and made their way from the top of the northern hemisphere and the bottom of the southern hemisphere.”
“It was utter chaos.” Amateur footage was plastered on the screen, showing droves of people in cities running away from predators and monsters.  “The advancing tides of terrifying creatures was like a pincer move on the world.  As a result of Calamity and the onslaught of prehistorimals, a third of the world population was lost, both animal and human.”
The camera switched scenes to an incredible cavern, cut deep inside a rich mountain where great columns of stone supported a rooftop which oversaw a complex yet vibrant city.  “Humans have been forced underground, where we have made our home underneath the mountains for the past several generations.  Here we are safe from the dangers of prehistorimals and rising sea levels.  Now, as the bicentennial anniversary of Calamity nears, we look back and remember where we have come from, why we stay in the mountains, and that the world outside is waiting for us when we are ready to fight back.  It is still far too soon to venture outside, but once we do, our civilization will do what it does best: persevere.”
Then it was mercifully over.  The screen faded to black, and a few sparse credits floated from the bottom. Narrated by Tiber Islesworth.  Visual renderings provided by the Rocky Mountain Coalition for the Preservation of the Underground.  Paid for by the Apophis Foundation.  The last credit was followed by a symbol of a small circle with three evenly spaced curly C’s sprouting from the wheel.  As the last image shambled out of sight, Corbin heard the fan on his laptop whirl wildly.  His mouse was unresponsive.  The computer shut down, and when he booted it up again, the video player had closed.  He tried searching for the movie in his files.  Nothing came up.  When he revisited the email Rami had sent him earlier that day, the attachment was missing.  Corbin’s head throbbed with what he just saw.  This has to have been a joke, but who would invest so much time and effort on a simple prank? The visuals were incredibly realistic, but evidently fake.  According to the end, only the visual renderings were credited, meaning they were all an imitation of genuine cinematography.  Lifelike, but an imitation all the same.
He checked his phone.  It was half-past midnight.  There were a few notifications from Rami that were sent hours prior.
They said: “Hey, did you get the email?  Better pay the piper and send those digits.  What was her name again?”
Then later: “C’mon, Corb.  Don’t leave a man out to dry.  What’re those digits?”Then much later: “Whoa, hold on.  Sent you the wrong one.  It won’t play on my media player anymore.  Was probably a bum copy.  I’ll find the real version and let you know.”
And: “So…am I getting that number tonight?”
There was one final email from Rami.  It said: “Sorry, here’s the right one.  This should work this time.  Also, check your messages, numbnuts.” Then nothing else.
Corbin opened the attachment.  A grainy video started to play on his desktop, showing some birds fly by, accompanied by lethargic narration.  This was the real documentary; it appeared as lazy and noncommital as his professor, and it was hardly a half-hour long.
He closed his laptop and leaned back far in his chair.  His head was dizzy with dehydration; he hadn’t touched his hydroflask.  He was plagued with a difficult question: What had he just seen?  No matter what avenue of reason he followed, it all led to a troublesome conclusion: it was a warning.  A great Calamity would strike the planet some time in the future.  It could happen decades down the road, years, days, or even tomorrow.  He had no idea what he wanted to do with that crucial information.
Instead, Corbin flipped off the lights and slipped into bed, clothes and all.  He silenced his phone alarm and rolled over, planning to sleep in late.  He’ll just take the day off tomorrow.  Maybe even talk to his counselor about switching his major.  He fell asleep to heavy rain pounding against his window."	9.82	11.0	J.C.

Broken Marble Cherry Bowl	"Grande Nonno died making a living, like Papa. He was born with his blue denim sleeves rolled up.
He and Grande Nonna are buried just a few miles south of the Apuan Mountains on the Alps’ Italian side. They’ve been rotting away in a small village cemetery near the town of Caravaggio. Caravaggio, Italy, is in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy, 40 kilometers northeast of Milan’s municipality.
Carrara is in central Italy. Carrara is in the provinces of Massa and Carrara. The region is famous for the white and blue-grey marble quarried there. The brilliant, almost translucent blue and grey exist as arteries and veins, frozen in memoriam. The Carrione River gushes in the winter through the canyons of the region. Flash floods in the spring have been known to cleanse citizens clear out into the Ligurian Sea.
At first glance, the Apuan Alps of northwest Tuscany’s Carrara region are pure white. You can imagine snow being born in the high castle crags.
Early train travelers through the regional mountains had been cautioned of the risk of blindness due to marble dust and glare from all the whiteness. The talc of powder is said to be under the control of no other than the wind, a stiff wind that wants nothing to do with humankind.
Most travel guides, even today, will tell you the Carrara region is famous for three things: marble, anarchy, and pig fat. This unlikely trio is intertwined as deeply as the mineral veins striating the marbled mountains.
Since ancient Roman times, Carrara’s Apuan Alps have supplied marble for some of the world’s most prized sculptures. Carrara is the marble of Michelangelo’s Pietà, Jean-Antoin Houdin’s George Washington, and New Delhi’s vast Akshardham Temple. The stone is blessed with luminosity, its networks of blue arteries and veins, nature’s psychological Rorschach test ranges from grayish to purple. In monolithic form, it can support the sky, like Half-Dome in Yosemite, California. It has been winnowed down into the translucence of light itself in thin slabs, a fitting lid on an iridescent coffin.
My name is David. I’m a little softer than marble but much colder. It’s taken a while to get here, but that’s what you get when you grow up in the middle of a nightmare.
This story isn’t so much about me. It’s mostly about us. Yes, dear reader, you and me, us humans, with all our ugliness, beauty, and pain. It’s about the idiosyncrasies and occasional flaws of raising children, children whose only intent is to live, once born. There’s not one baby book available online or in a storefront about how to raise a monster. I can assure you, the parents that no how-to, don’t need any damned instructions.
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy a wonderful life, especially now that I’ve lived alone for just over a decade. Papa and Mamma are back in Northern Italy, going on eleven years now. They will be back, not to worry. In most ways, they’ve never really left. They are like shadows that remain hidden, but for midnight.
When I say that they are not really being gone, by that, I mean there are very few places in this run-down house where they don’t exist. And, outside, they are out there too.
Papa is in the drippy faucet, the one he couldn’t fix. And so I put up with it, and wait. It’s just off their bedroom, on the second floor. Now that they’re gone, I sleep in their queen. Papa is in the crazy garden. Jesus, it’s insanely productive. Most of us Italian’s are birthed with green thumbs. He’s no exception. Hell, he’s placed enough bullshit in the dirt to turn the backyard into a greenhouse. The soil can’t help itself. It’s rich and loamy.
He’s in the tomatoes stakes, the ones he used his machete to ax into six-foot lengths. The stakes are round and made out of two-inch dried bamboo. He uses four to stand up the cages, cages meant to confine the beautiful green and red of the plants. Papa makes the wire cages too. It seems he makes everything except the water. In July, once the plants have taken hold, he uses the iron enclosures to jail all the tomatoes with cheap labor until they are forced to ripen.
The rake, he’s damned well in it. Papa’s in the sweaty oil on the tacky handle. He’s also in the missing hickory slivers that have ended up in his calloused palms. I can even feel him in the shovel, the square, and the round one. Papa’s strong hands are there, the ones that he’d forced around my throat.
The rounded shovel has a grave digger’s blade, having killed a rat or two. It acts as guillotines and can be used to take out Napoleon’s armies of screaming tomato worms, as well as any meandering garden snake.
Father is in the pantry, more stubborn than any simile. I swear to it. He’s in the ugly green wooden cabinet, the cabinet built onto one of the garage walls. He had inherited from the previous homeowners. Papa was there when he smashed the planked wooden door on my curious fingers after he’d carelessly left it unlocked. He was as quiet as a panther in the single-car parking space.
He’d reinforced the shelves, “extra support never hurt nuthin’, he’d said. If I catch you climbing up them again, I’ll crack your eardrums open like a walnut shell.”
Brandied cherries, thorny blackberries, and drunken raisins, a container of bay leaves, dried leaves broad enough to cover your crotch, they’re all in there, his damned pantry, canned jars of minestrones soups, pickled venison with bone broth, broth he’d used to boil meat off a cats ribs.
I love Papa. I can’t get enough of him, even though he’d never taught me a damned thing or showed an ounce of affection. He’d beaten me so hard once. He used a messy summer fly-swatter. The kids at school teased me for more than a week. They’d called me porch-face because of the clumsy screen door in the back of the house. I wouldn’t dare tell them the truth. Don’t get me wrong, I truly love him, Papa, way over in Italy, but if not for the distance, I’d kill him.
It’s like when ivory Domino’s fall, Italy.
One after the other, first cousin Adrianna broke her back. She’d been living taking care of Nonno and Nonna in their two bedrooms inherited cottage. Winter had been a bastarda that year. Those cloudy Cumuli scoundrels just wouldn’t let up or leave.
The storms had come over the ice-box Apuan Mountains like some uninvited frost-bitten, frost-bitten diesel train. They huffed and puffed their swollen blue faces, clean out of Switzerland and Austria. The back stoop and steps had frozen.
In the last atmospheric disturbance, Adrianna had forgotten all their scratchy linens she’d hung out on the clothesline in the AM. When she’d clipped on the wooden clothespins, there had been sunshine, clawing itself over the horizon. The landscape was frozen, but the fragile sunrays had been as dry as a church mouse fart.
She’d seen them as flags, all the sheets, and towels. They’d flapped parallel in the same direction of the sleet. If the sky hadn’t been so windy, they might have frozen all their stiffness in place.
Both feet had come out from underneath her hefty girth. She attempted to scoot across the stoop and down a short run of stairs. Adrianna’s heard the crunch before, the time she’d chopped fresh kindling for the cottage’s cast iron stove. She’d cracked her cervical spine in three places.
The médico had ordered rest and that she lay as stiff as a corpse for at least two months. I don’t know what in the hell they call them in Italy, but the doctor had also thrown a shitload of Benzodiazepines at her to “uplift her mood,” he’d said.
Adrianna had sounded as if she was a happy zombie. She’d begun to slur her words. So, she used the neighbor on the other end of the phone. This neighbor lady, Arelia, was one of a few in the village who knew broken English. Adrianna had stirred up the whole neighborhood with her high maintenance and melodramatics, most likely from her being high.
In short order, Arelia, the helpful neighbor, quit. She’d had enough of nursing Arianna, as well as for cooking and feeding Nonno and Nonna. She’d shouted in Italian when she’d left the cottage for the last time, “I’m not going to be used as some kind of crazy finger puppet.” That’s when mother and father’s trip was a done deal.
Hearing all this, mother and father had jumped on the first international flight out of San Francisco to Milan. Apparently, Caravaggio, Italy is another Hotel California, like the Eagles’ hit song, once you arrive, you can never leave.
By god, nothing was going to happen to Nonno and Nonna. My parents had too much invested, not the least the thirty-odd dollars they’d sent to Italy every month.
I’m sure their leaving had nothing to do with any future inheritance.
Back at the House
Although Mamma is in Italy, she’s never really left the house.
She’s in the pasta sauce she taught me to make: Butt loads of fresh garlic, a pinch of brown sugar, a teaspoon of vinegar, fresh basil, Papa’s rusty tomatoes, and her secret weapon, Italian ground sausage with fennel. There are enough jars of Mamma’s pasta sauce in the green pantry to fill up a Venetian Gondola. I almost forgot, add about ½ cup of tawny port wine, not the cooking kind. In Northern Italy, that’s how we roll.
She’d used her intoxicating pasta sauce and pasta to keep papa fat and uncomfortable, too uncomfortable for kinky sex.
Mamma had been the Comet shine in the scratched porcelain sink. I’m messy. She cleaned the kitchen floor good enough to eat off, vacuumed the rug in front of the big screen TV, left wheel marks resembling perfectly furrowed OCD rows of corn, truer than any in Kansas. I have stacks of dirty dishes on the coffee table. The washer broke, and now I’m using the dishwasher to clean all my clothes.
I almost forgot, Mamma is down the drain in the bathtub and out the sewer pipes, swimming toward the mainline. Everything she ever did is out there. I hope the witch stays in Italy, never comes home.
Mamma’s into saving. She’s a penny-pincher.
She’d hoarded change, mainly the spare dimes she could fit into Papa’s discarded whiskey and cognac, Toro Gordo see-through tubes. The nasty cigars never left his mouth. Each tube was gifted at storing their designated dimes, each dime held snugly in its place. Dimes were tight, seemingly pinching themselves into place, each dime a fool, should they even think of leaving the nested affection.
I’ve spent every one of those Mercury-headed sons-a-bitches, those President Franklin D. Roosevelt, In God We Trust counterfeit dimes. Money is evil. It needed to be punished. I gave them all away at the Thunder Valley Casino, just north of Sacramento. It had taken a lot of liquor, anger, and time to spend the forty-eight tubes of stolen dimes. Losing had never felt so good. Returning at 3:00 AM Saturday morning, I’d slept most of the weekend away, having gorged on an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Canning
With COVID and all, and since Mamma’s cooking is in Italy, I’ve taken up canning.
Canning has become extremely popular with my generation. I am a millennial. It’s a safe, effective, and simple process, and it’s crazy inexpensive. Mother made me inexpensive, cheap enough to toss away if she could have gotten away with it. She gave me to Papa, expecting he’d use me up. I hate her as much as sin, with all her paternal conspiracies.
People can take advantage of canning to preserve just about anything: fruits, peaches, plums, thorny and bloody blackberries picked in the boiling sun, along the Yuba River, vegetables, soups, sauces, and meats, damned right, all kinds of proteins.
In the late 1700s, that crazy war genius, Napoleon Bonaparte, commissioned a regional search for a better method to preserve food. He believed that “An army travels on its stomach.”
He was looking for a less expensive and more efficient way to feed his armies. He intended to make food last longer and give his armies nutritional food, meat to build up their strength. Their heritage of strength is what allowed the troops to perform more of their carnage in all the battles. And so Napoleon proposed a hefty bounty to anyone who could come up with a better method of preserving food in quantity, with a long shelf life, even though most of Napoleon’s soldiers had a limited expiration date.
A genius named Nicholas Appert had claimed the prize, though it took until 1810 for him to perfect his discovery. But like most time-proven inventions used for the military, it would take about fifty years before the methodology and know-how would trickle down to the average family. Think of Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars.
By 1858, this brilliant, cylindrically shaped man, John Mason, had invented the iconic, reusable “Mason Jar.” The Mason jar is the gold standard of canning, even today.
The best thing momma taught me before she left was how to can. I do thank her for that if nothing else, and I will be grateful to her for the rest of my life.
The Supplies:









I admit it’s become an obsession, canning. It’s been more than a hot minute, well, over ten years now, since Papa and Mamma left for Italy. I might have to whisper, but I think I’m a better canner than my missing Mamma. You heard me right. Mamma went missing while in Italy. She’s still missing.
If I sound a little matter of fact, well, for Christ-sakes, I am. I don’t miss her a bit. Hell, she’s everywhere I turn in this two-story falling apart clapboard house.
Let’s get back to canning. I don’t have time for terribly long stories.
Bitches, I am the RuPaul Andre Charles of canning. I’ve got canning game. Over the years, I have mastered the art. Yes, you heard me correct. It’s an art: Squatty Stainless steel jar lids, lids that stack in gorgeous, shiny rows in Papa’s garage pantry. Tall, long Mason jars, the glass of stars, full of peaches, their skin sloughing off. Don’t you just love the word slough? I eat the juicy peaches, skin first. I’ve preserved Kidney beans and canned eggplant, the kind that resembles the Emoji penis. I’ve canned olives, as dark as jackal eyes, red pimento’s for pupils. Green-fingered asparagus, some as thick as longshoremen’s thumbs, the rest, as long as your middle finger, I’ve stored them all.
I figure all the canned goods in Papa’s green cupboard should last at least five freaking years. Think about it, not having to shop for food, all the plague masks, all the germs, the disguising people?
I Quit my Job
I worked for the State of California in IT. My employer was the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. It was a nice fit for the longest time, the past twenty years. But, with all the write-ups, suspensions, and disciplinary action, I told the governor of the golden state of California to shove his state job up his Department of Controller’s ass. I’d had it.
The talking behind my back and taunting had gone on for months. I was accused of sexual harassment, gender insensitivity, and for keeping less than standard hygienic practices.
It was never written up formally, but my immediate supervisor had also accused me of excessive flatulence. He’d said, “I’ll save you all the embarrassment by not having it on the record.”
They assumed father had simply disappeared in the woods. He’d been hiking a lot after Mamma’s disappearance. Well, he’d disappeared too. It was in early February. Ah, em, it had been snowing a lot. The Apaun forests were deep and dark, all that bullshit.
Think of me as the red stapler man in the hit movie Office Space. I’d been placed in a corner, next to a dingy wall, at the end of a long row of cubicles. I’d been made fun of for the longest time. There had been food on my shirt that I’d made sure to wash at least once a month, the broken clip on my suspenders, my olive oiled hair, a litany of complaints.
They’d said, “He’s a pig, eats most of his food out of jars, he farts like a bull in a software China shop. He scrambles and breaks every damned software application and Microsoft Excel spreadsheet account that he touches. His math is sloppy. He doesn’t add up.”
“Fuck you,” I shouted when Kevin won the yearly IT award. I wouldn’t have been so bad, but I used the third floors intercom.
This girl named Nancy had turned me in for wearing real pig’s ears for Halloween. I thought It was appropriate. I used elastic and Velcro and had dried them out. “Fuck you,” I’d shouted when they’d told me who it was that complained. “Fuck all of you, Nancy,” I’d said. “You bitches are going to end up in a Masson’s canning jar.” I was fired the very next day. They walked me clear down the block to the bus stop.
Ok, I get this feeling that you are making fun of me too. This is so personal, and I have been sharing so much of myself. I know you think I’m crazy, reader. You can’t fool me. Don’t flatter yourself, smarty-pants. You think I killed my mother and father and jarred them. No, and No, and hell no!
I’m in Papa’s garage. He won’t mind. I’m using his workbench vice. Grande Nonno had a workbench, too, over there in Italy. He’d used it to sharpen all his slaughtering tools and wheat scythe. Grande Nonno and I had always gotten along. I loved him. He’s the one that taught me why the sheep in the foothills of the Alps have two downhill legs shorter than the other, walking the hills and all, in one direction.
Papa did everything big, including installing a commercial-sized workbench vice. His vice is industrial red and shiny as glass. I tighten it, tighter and tighter. Nothing ever escaped father. He held me down, two knees on my back, both hands in my long pissy hair, I’d wet the bed again.
As I grew older, he’d do this, but for other reasons.
I turn the handle. I have the vices dog fixed in place. I watch as the moving jaw moves in the direction of the stationary jaw. The main screws seem to elongate as the vice grips tighter, one of life’s paradoxes. I crank and crank until Papa’s double-barreled shotgun is fixed in place.
I saw and saw, using the hacksaw.
As the storm shakes the rafters, I play Papa’s favorite CD using his cheap flea-market vintage player. How he loved him some Brahm, especially the classic-haunted lullabies, steeped in all the Mephistophelian memories they evoked. He loved the anxious melody, all the nervous piano keys, the white noise that kept my–his demons at bay.
Piano Concerto Number Two was his favorite, with its assemblage of Stradivarius violins fluttering their hyaline wings off. How it reminds me of the times, I’d torn the wings off the butterflies whenever the pain ferreted itself into the light, sniffing for vengeance.
Most of the cold steel barrel falls to the floor. I sand and sand what’s left of the barrel until it’s smooth to the touch. It never heats up. It remains cold.
I snap on the TV in the family room. It takes a while to find the channel with only white noise. Next to me, on the make-shift end table is a mason jar. It’s filled to the brim with pickled pig’s feet broth, mostly bitter vinegar. I grasp the jar in my sweaty palm. I swish the dog’s eyes in a clockwise direction. I place the vacuum-packed jar back on the card table next to the couch.
The age-darkened sheep’s eyes spin and whirl in a circular motion of sight, no longer tethered to their brains by any pesky optic nerves or even semblance of reality.
I pick up the jar again. I stare back and spin the wolf’s eyes in a counter-clockwise direction. I smile. I place the cyclone of deception and conspiracy back on the table.
Now I can use my index finger on the trigger. The shotgun barrel is so much shorter now. Using my toes was unrealistic since I’ve gained so much weight after being terminated. Terminated, what a harsh word, isn’t it? Because of all the nutritious canned protein, I’ve become a little cherub. There’s no way my chubby two toes were going to blast me over the moon.
Dear reader, if you’ve gotten this far, I’m truly sorry. You will have to sit on the couch now, directly across from me, and watch.
You’ll have company. They are watching me too. The feral eyes are strobe lights, a horrific merry-go-round of sight, the son’s-a-bitch, around and around they go. The room fades to black, the TV splatters.
You know most of the rooms in the house by now. After you puke your guts out, you run toward the leaky shower in the master bath. The blistering hot water can’t rub your bloody skin off fast enough, “Fuck the crime scene,” you shout at the top of your lungs, into the ceiling. You contemplate how your pretty world has just shit its pants.
You exit the shower. The room has turned into a psych ward spa. Everything is a vapor. You splash ice water on your face over the sink in front of the massive mirror. You rub and rub at the steam on the glass.
Directly behind you, in the mirror, is your new reality. You can see it clearly now. It stands bleeding, broad-shouldered. Somehow the brawny shoulders are holding up a broken marble bowl of cherries. The bloody cherries are globing over the rim of the bowl.
After you’ve determined the broken bowl is what’s left of my skull, I make you feel the icy barrel against your flesh, directly behind your pounding heart.
Now, Son’s-a-bitch, the lights really do go out."	9.73	11.0	Dan A. Cardoza	03/31/2021
The Most Unfortunate Place on Earth	"“Death by electrocution or hanging?” Ethan asks Garret killing time as we wait in line for the newest ride at the amusement park.
“Boys…seriously. We are in the happiest place on earth, can’t you find something better to discuss?” I glance over at my husband Zack, but he shrugs his shoulders and grins and I can read his thoughts, “Boys will be boys.” I’m outnumbered again. Not that I mind, not really.
“But Mom, the line is soooo long and we are soooo bored.” I stretch my neck from side-to-side in sympathy. I’m constantly busy with work, the kids, and day-to-day life that one would think a few minutes with nothing to do would be welcome. However, there is something about moving inches at intervals that makes creeping time unpleasant.
“I understand, but please don’t hurt my heart by imagining ways to die.”
“Are you tearing up?” Ethan leers over me. He’s eighteen and taller than me by almost a foot and he loves to lord it over me every chance he gets. I catch a whiff of his Ralph Lauren Body Spray and a faint hint of perspiration.
I brush the tear out of my eye. “No. It’s sweat.”
“Aw, Mom, you’re okay. Nothing’s going to happen. Are you worried about the ride?” Not to be outdone, Garret flops a long, lanky arm over my shoulders. He too is inches taller than me but a few years younger than his brother and still willing to nestle in close. The Old Spice deodorant wafts over me and I take in a deep breath of his scent, relaxing into him.
“I’m fine. It’s the incessant heat and the repetitive music. And, the crowds. Let’s take a break after this one.”
“We’re almost there. I can see them loading the cars up ahead,” my husband Zack contributes.
“Thank God,” I mutter. I check my Fitbit for the time, the digital read-out shows me a little after 3:30 in the afternoon and I mentally give myself a high five. With over 25,000 steps, no matter how many churros I eat, I should still be able to tug on my jeans when vacation ends. “I definitely prefer the rides where we can skip to the front of the line.”
“Agreed,” Zack says.
The boys focus their attention to the front of the line while continuing their conversation. “Global warming or alien invasion,” Garret asks Ethan.
Zack rubs my back, but I step away embarrassed my shirt is sticking to my back. “Everything okay?”
I sigh. “Yeah, damn hormones. I feel fucking out of control. Those boys are going to be the death of me.” I take a deep breath and let it out slowly as we move forward a few paces in line. We needed some time as a family to reconnect. I’d lost my mom around the holidays and with Ethan leaving in the fall for college, I wanted to stuff the boys back into my womb, to keep them safe and near me. Hanging onto time with the kids felt like trying to wrangle water, it either slipped away or dried out before I could get a grip on it.
* * * * * *
The rollercoaster takes off like a rocket and immediately pisses me off. The g-force pulls my cheeks into a rictus of terror while a flash of light captures my horror for purchase in the gift shop after the ride. I hate to be scared and I loathe myself for not researching the ride before I got on it.
The harness pins me to the seat of the coaster and awkwardly holds me in its molded plastic embrace through twists, drops and turns in the dark cavernous space. Neon freeway signs guide our passage as the track weaves through the faux pitch of night. Cold air caresses my skin but the wind is as manufactured as the manicured lawns and ersatz lakes of this fantasy land.
Finally, we round the last corner into the flat straightaway. The snake of cars comes to an abrupt stop in the middle of the final stretch of the track. I can barely turn to make eye contact with my husband because my head is braced to the seat, but can see my kids in the seat in front of us smiling and laughing.
Concrete walls surround us as rock music blares out of the speakers. I need to pee. A sign up ahead signals the conclusion. I’m relieved to know the end is in sight.
Zack and I are the last two passengers, the caboose of this adventure train. We come to a complete halt. The kids only have enough movement to turn their heads to the side to shout back to us.
“What did you think?” Garret yells.
Ethan chimes in, “Totally cool, yeah?”
“Awesome, best ride ever!” I shout back.
I can see Garret smile because he is sitting in front of Zack, “So, you hated it, right mom?”
“What gave it away?” I grin.
“I can’t wait to escape off this thing. Did you like it?” I ask Zack.
“Sure, it was fun. But, I’m ready to go back to the hotel and chill,” Zack responds.
“Truer words, babe.”
The pressure in my bladder is growing urgent and I push against the restraint which hardly budges.
“What’s going on? Doesn’t it seem weird to be stuck here? Shouldn’t we be moving or something?” I ask Zack.
Zack shakes his head unconcerned. “I’m sure they’re just unloading the group ahead of us.” He reaches out and pats my hand.
“Are you sure we aren’t stuck?” I pushed against the padded metal contraption testing my wiggle room. It doesn’t shift a centimeter. This thing is safety constructed in the twenty-first century and I am well and truly trapped in my seat.
I want off this ride.
Zack’s harness appears a little looser, like maybe he didn’t pull it down across his chest as tightly as I had.
“Can you shift that thing?” I ask.
He presses and the unit clunks, allowing for slight movement. “Nope, I’m pretty secure here.”
“But it seems like you have more space in comparison to mine.”
“That’s because of my wide shoulders.” He flashes me a wink and flexes his bicep.
I wish for his levity as I twist again, trying not to let my fear of confined spaces weave its tendrils in me.
In front of us, Garret turns his head and shouts back to us, “I think the coaster broke down. Dad, check over the side, do you see a walkway?” I study my surroundings. We are in a tunnel, the track is raised a bit from the floor, but there is a sidewalk off to the right side of the car where we could depart. The entirety of our chain is stuck in the middle of the space. A neon arch signals the tantalizingly close exit just around the bend toward what I can only hope is the disembarking area. The area is no frills. All concrete blocks, and low lighting, meant to be whizzed by in a blink.
“Do you think we’ll be evacuated like we were from Highland Falls?” Ethan asks, the excitement in his voice palpable.
I strain to listen to them because they are a couple of feet away from us. Even though we are sharing the same car the harness makes it hard for them to move their heads enough for their voices to reach us. The short guitar-laden riff keeps replaying, an indication we shouldn’t be sitting for this long.
A recorded voice pops over the music. “The ride is experiencing technical difficulties, please stay off the track. The ride may resume without warning.”
I stifle a giggle and shove against my restraint. “And how exactly, would we be able to hop out to stretch our legs on the track?”
“Maybe it’s a warning to the workers?” Zack suggests.
Ethan shouts, “Cool, do you think we’ll journey behind the scenes again?”
“I don’t know.” Now that we are stuck, my bladder clenches and I wish desperately I had used the bathroom beforehand.
I consider what will happen if I pee on the seat. It’s molded plastic, so I’m fairly certain I would end up sitting in a puddle. Luckily for Zack, we each have our own precast space, so my shame would be my own. I imagine my humiliation as we roll into the unloading dock and the groans of the workers as they witness my soaked ass leaving the ride. All resulting in a loudspeaker telling the guests the coaster is temporarily closed for hazardous cleaning. Boos and jeers follow me as I depart. My kids, horrified, walk as far ahead of me as possible so as not to be associated with me in any way.
To distract myself, I ask, “Do you think a group is stuck in the middle? Like what if they are stuck upside down?” Surely, someone else must have it worse.
“The g-force or gravity would settle the cars to a flat spot,” my husband calmly answers.
“Do you think there is a safety mechanism, a catch release to open our seats or do you think it needs a command?”
“There’s probably a catch hidden, but it will be extremely difficult to find. Too many idiots would be exploiting the system.”
My heart rate picks up and the walls appear to shift closer. The air coming into my lungs feels heavier as if my lung capacity has shrunk and the air can’t inflate my chest.
Zack reaches across the seat and takes my hand. The loudspeaker comes back on with the same recorded message about a problem with the track.
* * * * * *
The time is 4:36 pm and we are still stuck. No workers come to rescue us, the cart hasn’t moved and the recorded message hasn’t changed. We’ve diligently searched for any release buttons, but if there is one to push, we haven’t found it.
My bladder is pulsing with my heartbeat and my thighs and knees are shoved together so forcefully that if it wasn’t for the pain, I’d wonder from the sweat buildup if I’d already succumbed to the pressure.
There are six cars in our little train, each loaded with four passengers. We can’t tell much about the people ahead of us as the coaster spans thirty-five feet and no one can turn their heads more than slightly to the sides due to the head restraints. The music is so loud we can scarcely understand the kids in the seats in front of us, let alone the car in front of them. I can count the hairs on the boy’s heads, yet I can’t reach out to stroke them.
Zack maneuvered his phone out of the holder in front of him, but has no cell service. Ethan tried to grab his phone from the front pocket, and proceeded to drop it on the floor. He shuffled with his feet to try to snag it, but so far with zero success. Garret, having watched Ethan (and given us the humorous play by play), carefully retrieved his phone and was currently playing a game, which kept them both occupied for now.
“Zack, what is going on?” I ask for the hundredth time.
“I don’t know.”
“This can’t be good.” My breath hiccups as I try to keep from crying.
“I know.”
“What could possibly be keeping them from coming to rescue us? The lawsuits alone should have them rushing to release us. Why hasn’t a real person made an announcement?”
Zack stares at me with bleak eyes and holds my hand tighter. I wish I hadn’t pulled away from him in line.
“I’m scared,” I whisper.
* * * * * *
I’ve since peed the seat and my butt is already starting to dry out. The boys also had to go, but at least they had the option to aim for their feet.
Pain is starting to shoot down the sides of my neck from being locked in the same place for so long. Garret’s battery died and now they keep asking more questions that we can’t answer. We’ve played several rounds of I’ve Never and Would You Rather. The game stopped when Ethan, asked, “Would you rather die slowly of starvation and be dead or die fast, but live on eating others for the rest of your life?”
“What the fuck Ethan? Dude, not cool.” I don’t want to admit how much his question unsettled me, at 6:43, it’s after sundown and still nothing has happened. “Let’s take a break. I’m struggling to hear anyway.”
“What? I’m joking.”
“Right, but I love you and don’t like to think about those things okay?” The boys turn forward and I trade a look with Zack and we both shake our heads. My skull is pounding and an internal pressure is building like I’m going to burst out of my skin. I’m not sure I’ll be able to enter into an enclosed space after this experience ever again.
I’m craving the touch of my family. I want Zack’s arms around me. I want Ethan stepping on my toes and Garret’s arms hanging around my shoulders. I start to hyperventilate and push those thoughts away; we’ll be out soon enough I tell myself.
Over the music, a woman screams to be heard, “Hello? Can someone call 911? I think my husband is having a heart attack.”
A murmur goes up as the canned announcement breaks in and one man yells out, “Lady, I’ve tried my cell phone a thousand times, I can’t receive any service in here. The system is down.”
Another woman shouts out. “I’m sorry. We’ve had the same experience.”
The first woman’s lilting voice makes me wonder if she’s from the South. “Does anyone know what I should do? I can’t reach him.” Her voice breaks into a sob. Tears of commiseration rise in my eyes, as I peek at Zack and wonder what I would do.
My son gazes back at me and I shake my head miserably. We’ve been stuck for hours. We have a bag of kettle corn and a half of bottle of water. My kids, screwing around, spilled what soda they had left arguing about whose it was and so they have nothing.
“My daughter is going to try to dislocate her arm to get out of out of the seat.” A man yells out to the group.
“Will that work?” I ask my husband.
“It can’t hurt,” he answers.
“Ma’am, tell your husband to hold on. Amina is twisting herself right now. She’s super flexible and she’s willing to try to knock her arm out of the socket if it means getting us help.”
“Yes! Please! Hurry!” Her voice is hysterical and keeps breaking as she tries to be louder than the guitar rift. “He’s having trouble breathing.”
A few minutes later, a little slip of a girl is standing outside of the tracks on the walkway. Everyone starts applauding. Sweat is trickling down the sides of her face, her arm is hanging perversely, and yet she holds her head proudly as she walks down the line of cars to the front. A mischievous grin comes across her face and she gives a quick bow, holding her one working arm out like a performer. As she walks down the track, I can see her bottom is wet from sitting in a puddle. We cheer her and she limps off, holding her arm gingerly as she rounds the corner and exits out of sight to find help.
Excited whispers and chatting reanimates the group.
“I think my feet are numb.” I try to wiggle my toes, but it’s just something to say. I feel reinvigorated; finally, something will happen and we can clear off this damn ride.
Zack grasps my hand and squeezes. “Not for long.”
“I can’t wait to go home and take a shower.”
“Mom, do you have any water? We are dying up here!” Garret yells back at us.
“Well, if you guys hadn’t been fooling around,” I respond.
“Please. It was Ethan’s fault. Help is coming. Dad can reach, right Dad?” The hopeful expression in his eyes just about breaks my heart. Whatever is keeping people from liberating us can’t be good. While I try not to think about it, it’s all I can do to keep my mind from ping-ponging on possibilities. Why hasn’t anyone come looking for us? In a place dedicated to providing outstanding experiences, this situation is more than a little abnormal and, in a world, where lawsuits are a dime a dozen, well…
I glance at Zack, “What do you think?”
“You guys can wait a few more minutes. Teach you a lesson,” he says. I narrow my eyes at Zack and he doesn’t look at me.
I keep obsessively looking at the time. The guitar rift lasts three minutes, forty-three seconds, the announcement twenty-five seconds and in-between there is a blessed five seconds of bliss. It’s been one hour since Amina left.
Zack is pelting the boys with the kettle corn, challenging them to catch it with their mouths, which serves to occupy and distract their starving bellies. The announcement ends and in the window of silence I make out a pop-pop-pop which sounds like distant gunfire.
I pull a muscle in my neck jerking my head to Zack. “Did you hear that?”
He shakes his head, “What?” The music starts up again.
“Keep throwing popcorn!” I hiss.
Zack frowns at me and complies. I reach over and seize his hand in a death grip. “I think I heard gunfire.”
His eyes widen.
The message ends and we both hunch forward straining our ears. Zack watches me as he concentrates and then I catch a rhythmic rat-tat before the guitar screams out over the speakers. We both sag back into our seats.
Garret’s turned to face us and his eyeballs scan back between the two of us. “What’s going on?” He asks.
Zack throws a kernel and nails him smack on the nose. Garret grabs the corn and pops it into his mouth, allowing himself to be distracted.
“It must be pretty bad for her not to return.” Ethan states.
“There is no point wondering,” Zack says trying to shut down speculation. All it does is stop the kids from talking to us as they whisper back and forth with each other.
“Did you hear anything?” I ask.
“I don’t think so.”
“Well, keep listening. I think the second time I might’ve heard an automatic weapon. That can’t be right, right? Not here?”
“I think you are getting yourself worked up. Just breathe.” Zack says.
“I will once I get out of this seat.”
He mimics taking a deep breath and blowing it out. I yank my hand away from his and face forward.
A loud wail interrupts my thoughts of throttling Zack. “I think the woman’s husband died,” I whisper as if I’m afraid she will overhear us.
“Where is the girl?” I ask as I reach back to clutch his hand. “What could be keeping her? What is happening out there? Do you think this is it? Are we going to die here?”
“I hope not.”
“Is there anything we can be doing?”
“Well, that’s why I didn’t give the boys the water.”
“Yeah, I figured as much,” I say grimly.
I occupy myself with going over every square millimeter of space I occupy, but it’s useless. There aren’t any screws or knobs for me to try to manipulate.
Someone screams. “Oh, my God.”
“What is happening?” A voice sounds above the music.
A wave of panicked voices surges over the zippy beat. Someone whistles sharply.
A man’s voice calls out. “There is no easy way to say this, but the woman’s husband who died of a heart attack appears to have come back to life and is trying to eat her.”
I turned to Zack and start to cry. The kids peer back at us with panic in their eyes. I struggle against my restraints. I look at Zack. “Is there any way I can do what that kid did? Can I dislocate myself to twist out of this thing?”
Zack’s frantically shoving against the restraint. None of us are flexible, so bending our way out of this situation is out of the question. I catch heads bobbing as the people in front of us gyrate with what I assume is the same ferocity as us. Straitjackets would be as damning.
“Mom, I’m scared,” Garret yells.
“Me too, buddy. But hold on. Try to wiggle out. Do whatever you can to maneuver out of your seat. Break your arm if you need to. We have to get out. Our lives depend upon it.”
I start hitting my shoulder against the plastic molding. With my shoulders firmly secured, I can’t get a good enough angle or enough momentum to twist enough to make a difference. I scream in frustration. Ethan squints at Zack because he can’t quite turn enough to make eye contact with me. I force a laugh. “I’m just trying to Hulk it. I thought a little extra inner power might help.” He nods, not believing me, but wanting to.
When I pictured all the dangers my kids would face, I imagined things outside of my control, strangers-someone luring my kid with candy, or them following a ball out into the street. As they got older it switched to online fears, which morphed into concerns about alcohol or heroin or antibiotic-resistant chlamydia. But I didn’t think I would end up watching them die in front of me while I could do nothing but bear witness. This was the most fucked up hell I could imagine.
We joked about a zombie apocalypse. Jesus, what had Ethan said? “Eating others for the rest of your life”? Surely this had to be some sort of reality TV joke and someone was going to bust out any moment and…
“Mom, I don’t want to die like this,” Garret shouts, tears streaming down his face.
“I know. We will figure out a way.”
“Mom, I don’t want to be a zombie.” He cries, hands pushing against the bars holding tight against his shoulders. I flash to him on a baby swing, face screwed up, arms outstretched hollering for me to rescue him.
Ethan starts jumping up in his seat, “Garret, shut up.” I remember one day when I got mad at Ethan for something stupid when he was two and yelled at him. Instead of crying, he laughed at me as if my overreaction was the funniest thing in the world.
“We’ll figure this out. Right, Zack? We got this.” Zack is silent as he studies the front of the cars and I’m so angry with him for not fixing this. Why can’t he fix this? Why can’t I? “Zack” I scream. “We can’t let this happen to them. We’ve got to do something.”
Zack looks at me with tears in his eyes and smiles. His hand is holding mine and he blows me a kiss and I breathe.
A loud whistle rips over the music. Startled, I glance up.
A small figure limps into view. Behind her is an undead cavalry.
Amina’s head dangles and swings, her hair hangs in her face so I can’t make out her features. I strain my eyes to understand what I am seeing. At first, my eyes think she is moving funny because of her dislocated arm, but I catch the shine of white bone and understand the arm is no longer attached.
Behind her follow six tourists. Because of the dimness, it would be easy to think this is the rescue we’ve been waiting for, but deep down I recognize they are not our salvation. My chest vibrates with a hum rising and resounding through my clenched teeth.
They don’t appear dead, more like plastic dolls puffed up like marshmallows. Their skin is tight and shiny as if stretching to contain their fluids. Blood should be gushing out of the missing bits and pieces but instead the raw flesh is startling bright like the red scales of a koi fish.
One rather large woman has had her breasts ripped off and her belly removed, but her double chin is in-tact. Her empty rib cage gleams in the twilight with an inner pearlescent.
“Mooooom?” I hear. I grip Zack’s hand and my bones pulverize from his pressure. I close my eyes.
“Shut your eyes, guys. I love you. Shut your eyes.”
* * * * * *
Buzzing vibrations itch in tight threads. The rippling crimson waves distort my vision. Hunger roars and recedes and like the ocean. It will never be satiated.
I lift my head and push away; no more is to be had. My hand tangles and I tug, eager to move on. When my hand frees, it loosens an object that falls into my lap. Light is sucked into its depths. Oily metal fills my nose and the hunger urges me to move on. I pause. Cold sinks into my thighs and I try to understand the object.
Gun.
This is a gun. I hold the word in my mouth as I grasp it with my hand.
I try to stand and fall over.
I try to stand and fall over.
I slide on the ground. A part of me scrapes against the pavement. A piece of white chalk on a black chalkboard flashes in my mind and is gone. Meaning is as ephemeral as the memories of who or what I am. I rise to my knees and am able to place one foot down and then the other. I’m not right. The emptiness in me howls and eats my thoughts. Everything but the hunger.
I breathe the air searching for something to fill the clamoring void. A scent on the breeze that is not food, calls insistently. I peer down at my hand and observe I am clutching the black object. My hand loosens to let go.
My mouth remembers the word “gun” but keeps it safe, tight within my lips. I increase my grip.
I trip and get back up.
I trip and get back up.
A gust of wind blows against my face and the aroma is stronger. I know this scent and it guides me into a dark carnivorous space. My ears hurt with the loud sound and I almost leave. The hunger cannot detect food, but the scent is stronger here and its claws are sharper than the hunger.
The world is washed in cerise ribbons. The odor is in front of me, but I don’t understand what I see. I pause and try to remember but hunger needles me with every cell leaving no room for anything else.
I move forward to take one last inhalation of the smell that is better than hunger. I trip and my arm falls against one of the objects no longer food.
Soft hair brushes against my bare skin.
“Mom, I don’t want to be a zombie,” I remember screaming in my head.
The word safely held releases from my mouth. “Gun.”
I raise my hand and point and pull. The hunger chatters against the ringing in my ears. There is another and I reach out to touch before I point the gun again. The harsh noise distracts the hunger. In that moment, I am satiated.
The oily metal does not call like food yet it feeds. I move it to my mouth and put it in. The cold burns my lips and I pull."	9.0	14.0	Craig Groshek	03/31/2021
Sack of Knives	"It knows what you hate.  And it hates what you love.
I originally heard about “Sack of Knives” in one of my medieval literature texts—the class had sounded interesting out of my options that quarter, but two weeks in I was already wishing I’d taken another round of poetry or creative writing.  Part of it was the professor, who was chronically dry and boring as he gave a canned lecture he’d obviously regurgitated for the last twenty years.  But most of it was the language itself.  It was so archaic and hard to read, and I already knew I sucked at foreign language.  Some of the books were “modernized,” but most were just littered with footnotes in tiny block paragraphs longer than the text they were explaining.  And of course, when I finally saw something that sounded cool, there were no notes to be found.
It was in the middle of a story fragment about a village that fell under a curse of some kind.  People were going crazy, maybe?  Or their cows were all dying.  Hell if I know.  The accompanying woodcut made it look bad, though.  Still, it was kind of boring and dumb, and I was about to give up when a phrase caught my eye. If I wasn’t wrong, it read as “Sack of Knives.”
Like I said, there was no footnote, and when I went to the index, the term wasn’t listed.  I looked on the internet, but there was nothing about it there either.  My interest was already waning, but then an idea occurred to me.
The professor of the class was always telling people to ask if we had any questions, be it after class or during his student office hours.  No way was I doing that, but maybe if I fired off a quick email asking about it he would think I gave a damn about his stupid class.  I wasn’t a suck-up, but I didn’t mind a little padding in case I tanked on an essay at some point.  So I looked up his faculty email and asked him what the term meant before putting away my books and heading out to Jeff’s party.
I literally didn’t think about it again that night.  The party itself kind of sucked—it was one of those deals where there were too many people for it to be fun, so my little social circle wound up just hanging out together even though it was in my friends Jeff and Madison’s house.  They were both grad students, and Jeff was in a pissy mood about his thesis getting shot down.  This led to me and the others of our group taking turns whining about people that were being a-holes—bosses that were unfair, boyfriends and girlfriends that were unfaithful or controlling, parents and siblings that didn’t understand our individual and collective plights.  We were all drunk and only half-serious as we took turns trying to melodramatically one-up each other’s woes, and by the end of the night, we were all so exhausted from laughing so much that I wound up falling asleep on their floor.  When I got back to my dorm room the next morning, I saw I had an email.
Greetings, Mr. Holden!
So glad to see you taking an interest in the peculiarities of our medieval friends from the distant past!  The phrase you referenced is actually quite interesting!  It refers to an obscure pranking custom that was common in parts of Europe for a time.  It went as follows:
A group of friends or like-minded ne’er-do-wells would gather together and put names or (given the extremely low-rates of literacy) other identifying marks or objects in a sack or satchel.  Either way, the idea was that you were identifying a target for the prank—usually an enemy.  Once everyone had put a person in the sack, you all drew one back out.  Your own excluded, of course.
I say ‘of course’ because the purpose of the sack of knives was to harass or even hurt someone you hated without it being tied to you personally.  These were typically small communities where most everyone knew each other, and the risk of being seen and recognized while journeying to or from breaking someone’s fence or poisoning their feed was significantly higher than it would be today.  If someone saw an enemy lurking around their property and suddenly their cow got out or their chickens died…well, it would immediately be suspicious.  The sack of knives provided a measure of protection from such scrutiny, and generally it was limited to small pranks that wouldn’t raise too much ire, though there were always exceptions.
Once the prankster finished some act against their target, they would go back to the sack (usually hidden in a place everyone in the game knew) and put a stick inside with the name or identifier tied to it.  This symbolized the “knife” they used to “kill” their friend’s enemy.  The game wasn’t over until all the sticks and artifacts were in the sack.  I believe there were variations of the rules over the years, but generally no “winner” was ever specified.  I suppose their indirect revenge against those they hated was reward enough.
I thought about responding back, but decided against it.  It was cool of him to respond so quickly, but there was a difference between getting some brownie points and becoming pen pals with a Lit super-nerd.  Laughing at the idea, I closed my laptop and got ready for work.
* * * * * *
It was a week later when I mentioned the Sack of Knives to Jeff and Madison over dinner.  I’d brought it up as a funny story, but the more I described the email, the more interested they became.  Before I knew it, they’d called up Paul and Alison (two of our other friends who, based on the earlier party conversation, had clear axes to grind with someone).  They brought along their friend Marty who had just been fired from an internship for smoking weed in the parking lot.  I tried to put the brakes on before people came over and we got into some weird party game, but Madison wasn’t hearing it.  She said it was the best idea she’d heard in months.  That it sounded cool, fun, and very satisfying.  But the key, she noted, was having enough participation.
Winking at me, she turned and smirked at Jeff.  “It’s like that Hitchcock movie, right?  Criss-cross!”
* * * * * *
Three days later, I was carving the word “whore” into the hood of a stranger’s car.
We’d used a knock-off purse and index cards, but I supposed it worked well enough.  I’d pulled Alison’s former best friend, who had apparently slept with Alison’s high school boyfriend.  I wanted to ask if Paul (Alison’s current boyfriend) was okay with her still being so hung up on that past relationship, but I felt like it wouldn’t go over well, so I left it alone.  Instead, I dutifully folded up my note and tucked it in my pocket, planning on waiting ‘til later to worry if I was going to go through with a prank or not.
But letting go of the thought wasn’t so easy.  From the time I got the name and address, I was preoccupied with doing something to the woman.  It’s not like I’m a mean-spirited guy or anything, but it was just…dumb as it sounds, it felt like I’d made a promise I had to keep.
I went back to Jeff’s house after I was done and found the purse hanging in the toolshed.  Below it, there were three butter knives with rubber bands around them.  Cute.  I guessed the other three had already filled the sack, and when I put my own in, I saw I was right.  I wondered who had gotten my own special little request, and what they’d done.
I found out soon enough.
* * * * * *
“Jeff…J-Jeff’s dead.”
I squeezed the phone tighter as the ground seemed to sway under me.  “What? What do you mean?”
Madison’s voice was high and brittle when she spoke again.  “I mean he’s dead.  He had your guy…Calvin Egger was your guy, right?”
I slumped down onto the couch, barely able to breathe.  “Yeah.  Yeah, he was my guy.  Just this junkie I roomed with as a freshman.  He bailed first quarter, stole my laptop.  I could never prove it, but I knew it was him.  And he’s a townie, so I still see him around sometimes…” I blinked, coming back to the conversation.  “But how…how is Jeff dead?”
“He apparently tried to run that guy off the road.  Well, he did run him off the road.  The Calvin guy got messed up…they say they’re life-flighting him somewhere.  But Jeff went off the road too.  He hit a tree…”  The last word trailed off into a low moan.  I didn’t know what to say.  Jeff would never do anything like that.  There wasn’t a mean or crazy bone in his body.  It didn’t make any…
The phone clicked and went dead.  I tried calling her back, but there was no answer.  Turns out, there was a good reason for that.
She had shot herself in the head.
* * * * * *
In the past five days, two of the other three people have turned up dead as well.  One by suicide and the other was shot while he was trying to burn down a hardware store.  As for Paul?  Well, the police are still looking for him in connection with an aggravated assault where he allegedly broke an old man’s legs with a metal softball bat.
And me?  I’m currently a “person of interest” in a rape case.  Not because I have any connection to the victim whatsoever or because the woman has been able to give a clear description of anyone, but because my car was seen in the neighborhood the night it happened and a man matching my description was seen by a couple walking their dog.  The man was apparently carving the word “whore” into the victim’s car.  I’m not superstitious, but I’m not stupid either.  This wasn’t all a coincidence, and the thing that connected it all was that stupid game.  A game I’d learned about from my professor.
So I emailed him repeatedly, but I got no response.  After two days of waiting, I called his office and left a voice mail.  To my surprise, I got a call back that afternoon.
“Mr. Browning?”
“Um, yeah.  This Professor Miller?”
“It is, yes.  I got your voice mail.  You sounded very upset, but I couldn’t follow what you were talking about.  You mentioned something in the reading?”
I sucked in a breath and tried to keep my voice calm. “Yes, like I told you before.  It was in the coursework last month.  The story about the cursed village.  The thing that talked about the sack of knives game?”
There was a long pause, and I could hear the flutter of pages as he spoke again.  “I…I’m not sure what you’re talking about.  I know the story you’re referencing, but…just a moment.  Ah, yes.  I think I found the line.  Seax of knaves, right?”
“Um, if you say so.  You called it ‘sack of knives’ in the email just like I did.  But you have to know more than you…”
“Email?”
I frowned.  Was he drunk or something?  I didn’t have time for this.  If he wouldn’t give me straight answers, he could talk to the cops about it.  “Yeah, the email you sent me when I asked about it.”
Another pause.  “Mr. Browning, I haven’t sent you an email.  I don’t use email at all, if I’m honest.  Bit of a Luddite, I know, but old dogs and all that.  The department secretary will print out critical missives from my account, but I haven’t read anything from you or any other students in…well, probably better than a year.”  The man went on hesitantly.  “This is part of what I wanted to address.  You seemed in both the voicemail and this conversation to be under the impression that we’ve talked before, but I can assure you we haven’t—not outside of the times I might have called on you in class.  As for this phrase…well, it is interesting, but given your apparent upset, it’s certainly not a topic you should be focused on at the moment.  Perhaps you should talk to someone if you’re feeling very anxious or confused.”
I stood up and began pacing.  “That’s a load of bull.  I have the email.  I have proof.”
“Son, I don’t doubt you do, but I can tell you it wasn’t from me.  Maybe you got me mixed up with someone else, or maybe my account got…tricked?  Hacked?  I don’t know.”
I wanted to scream at him, but I wasn’t sure he was lying.  Wasn’t it possible someone else had gotten into his account or duped his address somehow?  But why?  And what did it have to do with the stupid sack of knives game?
“I really should be going.”
“No!  Please, professor.  Just…I’ll stay calm.  Just tell me what you know about the sack of knives game.”
I could hear him puff out a long breath on the other end.  “Very well, but if you get upset again, I’m going to let you go.”
“Okay, deal.”
“Okay.  As I said, it’s not ‘sack of knives’.  It’s ‘seax of knaves.’  Seax was an Old English name for a kind of knife, which makes your mistake rather humorous, I suppose.  They were single-edged, fixed-blade tools that were sometimes used as weapons in a pinch, particularly among the Saxons, whose name comes from that very same word.  As for ‘knave,’ that’s an old word for a trickster or a scoundrel.  Sometimes a thief or something worse.”
“Worse like what?  What does it mean in the book?  In that village?”
“I…I don’t know that I feel comfortable delving into old superstitions with a man that is so clearly distressed.”
I stopped pacing.  “Please, sir.  I need to know this.  And then I’ll let you go.”
He began again with shaky breath.  “The Seax of Knaves wasn’t a game.  It was a ritual.  In the region it originated in, “the knave” was a slang term for a demon or devil.  An evil spirit.  In the ritual, you became a “Knife of Demons” essentially—you were doing wrong against one who had not wronged you.  Spreading discord and suffering.  Part of the practical effect is clear—it was a slightly clever way of trying to get revenge on others indirectly.  But the more profound consequence was, supposedly, that you were binding yourself to this Other.  And whether you knew it or not, you were part of the offering to be made.” The man cleared his throat.  “There are stories of this throughout history, of course.  Places where people become strange.  Turn on each other.  Whole villages and towns have been lost to it, even in more modern times.  Today we call it mental illness.  Mass hysteria. And…well, I’m sure that’s the right of it.”  He laughed uncomfortably.  “If I may ask, why are you so fascinated by this?  You haven’t tried it yourself, have you?”
My vision began to swim as I nodded to an empty room.  “We…we did.  We thought it was a joke, and now my friends are dead and…”
He muttered something, and then said more clearly, “Do not contact me again.”
I heard a beep as he hung up.  Staring down at my phone, I replayed in my head what he’d muttered before hanging up, trying to make sense of it.

I Live Among Parasites	"I’m alone now.
They’re in the other room, eating.
The dog.
They’re eating the dog.
They don’t even try to hide it from me.  I’m apparently so weak, I’m not a threat to them.  They hid it when the cops came by.  They broke out into smiles, acted personable and friendly, told them I was delusional but not violent.  They’re mostly right.  Every time I look at them, I want to kill them, but then I see my wife’s face, my son’s face, and I can’t do it.  Besides, they’d probably overpower me.
I don’t know where “they” came from.  It started with a sore on my wife’s back.  At first, she thought it was from where her bra chafed, but after a few days it began to swell and blister.  I told her it looked like a boil, that she should go get it lanced.  She asked me to do it.  “By a professional,” I said.  I didn’t want to touch it.
She asked me to look at it again days later.  It had gotten so big, the skin around it was red and angry, and the shiny bubble of the infected area was cloudy white, but when I looked closer, I saw movement in it.  Something red seemed to swirl inside.
“That looks really bad,” I told her.  “You really need to go see a doctor about it.”
She twisted her arms behind her.  “Maybe I can get it myself,” she said.  She tried to pop it like a zit, but I could see her tensing in pain every time she prodded at it.
I couldn’t watch; it was too gross.  I started leaving when she gave a shriek.
She had burst it.  There was pus running down her back and on her fingers.  There was a smell too. Something rotten.  I lost all desire to have anything to eat that day when the odor hit me.
But the most noticeable thing was the long, segmented, wriggling worm thing that hung down from the open wound.
“What on earth is that?!”
She didn’t seem to feel it, but I could feel it on my own spine, the way that thing squirmed like it was pinned under a rock and trying to get free.
“Does it look better?” she asked.
Jesus Christ, woman, there’s some sort of centipede or something hanging out!
I should have known there was something wrong, the way she didn’t immediately panic from being told that.  Who in their right mind wouldn’t panic if someone told them there was a living creature crawling out of their giant burst boil?
“Can you pull it out?”
Can I pull it out?  Hell, no!  I’m not pulling that out.  But it was my wife, and I was reasonably upset and needed to kill that thing, so yes.  Yes, I’ll try to pull it out.
Oh god, please don’t let it touch me.
I went and got tweezers.  No way I was using my fingers.  I got that little bugger dead to rights in the grip of the tweezers, but that’s when I discovered it wasn’t trying to wriggle free.
It was trying to wriggle back in.
It was strong, too.  What kind of nightmare did that thing come from that it could fight back?
And then my wife started screaming.  Agonizing wails like I had a grip on her guts and was pulling them out.  I almost let go, but I was too determined to not let that thing loose.
Our son, bless his heart, came racing into the room to save his mommy from whatever was hurting her.
“Get out, get out!” I yelled.
“What’s wrong with Mommy?” he asked.
“She’ll be fine in just a second! Just get out and don’t look!”
Then I pinched the tweezers so hard they snipped the end off of that thing, and with what almost seemed like glee, it slithered back into my wife’s back and was gone, leaving just a wriggling little bit hanging from the tweezers.  I rushed to the bathroom, in part because I felt ready to puke, and in part because I wanted to be rid of the thing.  I wasn’t thinking clearly. I should have hung onto it.  Instead, I flushed it down the toilet and spent several minutes gripping my knees and waiting for my last meal to pay me a visit.
She was gone.  Not physically, but my wife wasn’t there anymore.
When I went back to check on her, she was just humming to herself and putting a bandage over the spot on her back.  There was a nasty-looking stain on the sheets where she’d been sitting.  She looked at me and asked if I was alright.
“Me?!” I cried. “You have a centipede crawling around inside you!”
“No, I don’t,” she replied.
“I saw it!” I said.  “We need to get to a hospital!”
I grabbed her wrist and suddenly she wrenched free and grabbed mine instead.  Good lord, her grip was strong.  She twisted my arm and shoved me away.
“I’m fine,” she said.
She told me the next day that she’d been to see a doctor, and I believed her.  She said the doctor couldn’t find anything wrong and had congratulated her on doing such a fine job of popping it.  Dear god, I just accepted what she told me as the truth.
Then three days later, she got him…my son.  I didn’t know!  I hadn’t realized yet that she wasn’t her anymore.  If I had known, don’t you think I’d have taken him out of there the very first night?  I would have driven to the far corner of the globe to keep him safe.
I came home, and he was already asleep in bed.
“What’s wrong with Tim?” I asked it…the thing that pretended to be my wife.
“Oh, he’s not feeling well, the poor dear.”
The poor dear.
I went in and checked on him to see how he was doing.  He was asleep, so I didn’t wake him.
It wasn’t until the day after, while keeping tabs on him in the bath, that I noticed the red welt forming between his shoulder blades.
“What’s that?” I asked him.  “Did you get hurt?”
“That’s my lucky mark,” he said.
“Lucky mark?”
“Mommy says it’ll bring me luck.”
God, no, it still hadn’t dawned on me.  I can tell you now, but when I was living it, I wasn’t putting two and two together.  All I knew was my son had a mark on his back that was starting to look red and swollen, and since the incident with my wife four nights ago was over, and a doctor had supposedly given her a clean bill of health, I didn’t think the two were related.
By the fifth night, it was exactly the same.  An angry, red blister, swollen with milky pus that seemed to be stirring underneath his skin.
“This is some sort of infection,” I told the thing pretending to be my wife.
“Don’t be silly.  It’s just a blister,” she insisted.  “It’ll go away.”
“No, it won’t.  This is exactly like what you had.  Maybe the thing that I saw coming out of your back got into him.  We need to take him to the hospital immediately!”
“Don’t trouble yourself.  If it looks this bad in the morning, I’ll take him tomorrow,” it promised.
“I’m taking him now!” I yelled.
“No, you won’t,” she said, and her face went completely blank, just all expression lost.  She opened her mouth, and her jaw hung down like it was loose in its socket, and even though she wasn’t moving her jaw or her lips, I could still hear her talking.  “If you try to take him, I will split you from groin to gullet.”
I have never seen anything so awful as my wife’s face all blank and her mouth hanging open while some thick second voice lurched out of her and threatened to disembowel me.  Was I scared?  You’re damn right, I was scared.  And to make her point, the thing grabbed a handful of my gut and squeezed so hard I thought she was going to actually tear me apart right there.  I was yelling in pain, and she just looked at me without any sort of expression and clenched my flesh in her fist so hard I ended up with a black and yellow bruise for days afterward.
Who the hell cares about bruises, though?
I was scared, and I knew it wasn’t my wife anymore.  I wanted to get my son out of there, but she never slept anymore.  I suspect she had been faking sleeping all along.  Me?  I hadn’t slept in our bed since the first night.  I had changed the sheets, but the stain from the stuff running down her back had left a mark on the mattress too, and I knew it was there and had no idea whether it was contagious or not.
Two days later, the boil on my son’s back had dwindled to a red sore spot again, but he was just like his mother now.  Always smiling and acting like everything was okay.  Never sleeping, either.  He’d let me put him…it…to bed, but when I’d go to check on it later, I’d catch it with its eyes open before it shut them to try and convince me it was asleep.
I can’t keep pretending they’re my family.
And then, of course, with me being outnumbered, they decided it was no longer necessary to keep up appearances when we were alone.  They’d sit down on the couch in front of the television and just let the bodies shut off…jaws hanging open, eyes rolled up back in their sockets, holding hands like a loving mother and son, but I suspect something far more insidious.  Maybe some sort of silent communication?  If I got up, or the phone rang, or someone came to the door, they’d immediately snap back to their game of pretending to be human.
I’ve told others, but after the first several looks of sympathy for a man losing his mind, I gave up.  It sounds cliché, but give me a break.  You don’t know how true it is until something this bizarre and frightening happens to you and nobody believes you.  The police came and almost dragged me away, but the wife and son things convinced them not to.  I’m the money-earner, after all.  They probably wouldn’t know what to do to make a living.
I can’t sleep.  They’re waiting for me to fall asleep. They’re in no rush.  They can wait me out.  It’s been weeks now, and they just sit there and watch television and smile, and every now and then they both turn to look at me at the same time to see if I’ve dozed off.  Joke’s on them, though, because I’ve been taking naps in the car after work before I drive home.
The real problem is, we’re running out of food.  I kept a freezer in the basement, stocked with a good month’s worth of stuff, and they ate through it all, like a pair of ravenous hyenas.  Neither of them leaves, so nobody goes grocery shopping.  I make sure to just eat at work, hoping to starve them out into the open, but then they go and do what they’ve just done.
Now that the dog’s gone, there’s only one thing left for them to eat.  Won’t that be a hell of a dilemma for them?"	9.69	13.0	William Dalphin	03/13/2021
Bedtime Stories	"I was tucking my daughter into bed one night last week.  Normally, she’s a huge hassle to make go to bed, but that night she seemed actually eager to go to sleep.  I sat down in the chair beside her bed and asked her what story she wanted me to read.  She smiled at me, but didn’t say anything.
“Smiley Shark?” I asked.
“No.”
“I Can Read With My Eyes Shut?”
“No…”
“Well, what would you like me to read?”
“I wanna tell a story tonight!” she exclaimed with an enthusiasm I was unused to.
“Oh, you’ve got a story, do you?” I said.  “Let’s hear it, then.”
She scrambled out from under her covers and climbed into my lap.
“It’s ‘bout a man,” she said, looking at me with a sudden intensity.  “Every night he walks down the street.  He wears a big, red coat.  In his pockets, he’s got a paper with a list of names on it.”
She lowered her voice to a whisper briefly.  “It’s a list of bad children.  They threw a tantrum, or they dumped their dinner on the floor, or they smacked their little sister on the face and made her cry.”
“You mean Santa Claus?” I asked.
“No.  Lemme finish my story!”
“Okay, I’m sorry.”
“He walks down a different street every night.  He’s got his list of kids and what bad things they done that day.  Sometimes, he ends up walkin’ down the street where one of those bad kids lives.  If he does, he stops at their house.  He doesn’t hafta check his list; he just knows who’s on it and if it’s their house.”
“If he comes to your house,” she said, pointing at me, “he’ll open the front door, even if it’s locked.  He comes in and looks at the photos of you on the walls.  He goes into your bedroom and stands by your bed.  His hands are always in his pockets because his fingers are really long and scare people.  But when he finds you, he takes his hands out of his pockets and covers your face with them.”
She demonstrated this to me by putting her own small hands over her face.
“He puts his hands on your face so you can’t breathe.  You can’t even feel him doin’ it ‘cause you’re asleep.  He keeps ‘em there ‘til you’re dead!  Then he takes his list out and crosses your name offa it.   Then he leaves, and nobody knows he was even there.”
She concluded the awful tale by crossing her arms and declaring matter-of-factly, “That’s why you gotta be good every day, ‘cause you never know if the man in the red coat is gonna walk down your street that night.”
We sat there beside her bed in silence for a moment. She beamed proudly, while I felt like all the blood was draining from my head.
“That’s a scary story,” I finally said.
“Only if you’re a bad kid,” she replied.
I wondered how confidently she’d have said those words if she’d thrown one of her usual tantrums that day.  It suddenly occurred to me that she’d been particularly well-behaved all night, and wondered if this macabre story was the key.  I tucked her in with a hug and a kiss and went to trade places with my wife, who was dealing with our other daughter, a toddler who won’t go to sleep unless you snuggle her for about an hour.
Later, with both kids down, I sat on the couch with my wife while she watched one of her shows and asked during a commercial, “Did Katie tell you her story?”
“No, we read Little House in the Big Woods.”
“Did you tell her a story about a man who kills bad children?”
“Of course not!”
The show came back on, so nothing more was said on the subject, but it nagged at me the rest of the night.  As passionate as I am about horror, I make sure to pad any scary stories I tell my daughter with a bit of humor.  I don’t want her afraid of the dark; I just want to nurture her imagination and creativity, you know?
The next day, we were drawing together.  She likes to have me draw cartoon characters, and then she colors them in with her crayons.  At one point, she came up and held a piece of paper over her face and yelled “BOO!” at me while I was at my desk.  She had drawn this cartoony kind of face on her own.  It looked to me somewhat like Ernie from Sesame Street.
“Is that me?” I asked.
“No.”
“Who is that?”
She paused for a moment, as if trying to come up with a name.
“It’s a zombie,” she finally declared.
“Oooh, scary!  What’s that line coming out of its mouth?”
“That’s its tongue.”
She drew me another picture after that, I thought it was a female version of the same face, but she had added a smaller drawing of a head beside it.  I took both these drawings to work and have them hanging up by my desk.
A few nights later, after we had gotten her ready for bed, she declared to me once again that she had a story to tell me.  I set down the books I had pulled from her shelf and sat down in the chair by her bed.  Once again, she crawled into my lap, sat up straight and looked me right in the eyes.
“Is it about the man in the red coat?” I asked.
“No, it’s about a mommy.”
“Does she have a good little girl or a bad little girl?”
“She’s got a little boy.  But then she died, and the daddy and the little boy moved away.”
“That’s a depressing story.”
“She looks for him every night.”
“I thought you said she died?”
She just looked at me, and I could see in her eyes that she was not making this story up as she went, but reciting it to me and trying to figure out the answer to my question.  She put her hand on her chin for a moment in an almost grown-up way.
“She’s a ghost,” she finally declared.
“Oh.  Well, that makes sense.”
“She came back to her home, but her little boy was gone, so she went lookin’ for him.”
“Did she find him?”
“No, she’s always lookin’.  She can’t drive a car, so she’s gotta walk, and it’s real far, and she doesn’t even know where to go.  So she just walks.  She’s got blood on her feet ‘cause her feet get hurt from all the walkin’.  If she hears a baby cryin’, she starts cryin’ too.  Sometimes, she’ll cry for hours after hearin’ a baby cry.”
“If she sees a child out at night, she gets confused and thinks it’s her little boy.  She’ll run up and try to grab the little kid right out of its parents’ arms.  If the kid is alone, she’ll snatch it up and carry it off.  Those ones are never found.  She always comes back ‘cause she hasn’t found her boy.  She might not even recognize him anymore ‘cause she’s been dead for so long!”
“How long has she been dead?” I asked.
“A long time,” Katie replied, shaking her head.
“How did she die?”  I don’t really know why I asked that question.
“She cut herself and then lost all her blood.”
That was too much.  I didn’t like that she knew these stories.  I was upset that someone had told her these awful things.
“Who told you that story?” I asked in my most serious voice.
She looked away for a moment, and I thought I had frightened her with my tone.  It took me a moment to realize she was looking at the window on the far end of her bed.  Outside it was dark, but I could see the trees at the edge of our backyard being blown about by the wind.  I waited, then shook her slightly to break the spell that the window seemed to have her under.
“WHO…TOLD…YOU?” I repeated.
She suddenly looked scared and upset, like she was going to cry.
“I’m sorry!” she wailed and hugged me tightly.
“Sorry for what?” I asked, rubbing her back gently to calm her.  Her little hands gripped my shirt, and I realized she was shaking.
“For…for…” she sniffed, “for talkin’ to strangers!  Please don’t get mad!  Please don’t let the man with the red coat find me!”
I hugged her even tighter.  “You weren’t bad. Nothing’s going to happen to you.  What stranger did you talk to?”
“The man who came to my window.  He told me the stories.”
Her words made me freeze.  We live on the second floor of a duplex.  I got up, setting my daughter on her bed.  She cried and begged me not to leave, but I hushed her.  I walked across the room to the window.  It was shut, but the wind was howling so fiercely you could hear it through two panes of glass.  Outside, across the back yard was dense woods.  The trees seemed to shake their branches at me menacingly.
“What did he look like?” I said, trying to sound calm.
“He looks like in my drawin’.”
I thought about the drawings she had made.  I get chills even now as I look at it and write this.  That simple line for a tongue suddenly seemed snake-like to me.  Those eyes a little too frightening.  She had drawn people before, but they never had the same look as these drawings.
That’s when I noticed the marks on the window’s glass.  It looked like something sharp had been dragged down it, like the edge of a coin or a rock.  Four jagged lines, a finger’s space apart, crisscrossing repeatedly in one spot against the window. And at the bottom, four deep grooves in the wooden pane."	9.64	11.0	William Dalphin	03/11/2021
The Jack Monster	"My father has always been somewhat eccentric, prone to tall tales of his childhood, keeping collections of old knickknacks and assorted antiquities he’d find at auction, and strict adherence to bizarre house rules.  Growing up in his home, the same home he grew up in, that was passed down from generation to generation, took a lot of willpower.  He would say it “built a lot of character.”  My mom would always say he was a character.
So it came as no surprise to me when a friend in the area called to let me know my dad had caught a case of pneumonia after they’d found him wandering around during the season’s heaviest snowfall in just an old pair of jeans and a wife-beater.  Since my mother had passed away, his bizarre behavior had grown increasingly erratic.
Some good Samaritans offered to drop in once or twice a day, but I didn’t want them to have to deal with his idiosyncrasies, so I drove up to the old homestead to nurse him back to health myself.  I hadn’t been back to that house since I’d finished school back in 1998.  It had always been a point of contention between us, but I just never felt comfortable there.
When I arrived, my father was curled up on the couch in the living room, wrapped in blankets and watching old episodes of The Woodwright Shop on the same TV he’d had for thirty years.  I gave him a hug which he mostly ignored in favor of sipping at a cup of tea.
“It’s good to see you, Dad.”
“You know, it shouldn’t take me catching pneumonia to get you to come visit,” he grunted.
“How’d you end up with no shoes in the middle of a snowstorm?”
He stared at the television, trying to ignore me.
“What were you doing out there, Dad?”
“If you’re going to stay, make sure you follow the rules.  You remember the rules, don’cha?”
I sighed.  “Yes, sir.”
“So let’s hear them.”
“Don’t touch the thermostat.  Don’t leave lights on in rooms you aren’t occupying.  Replace any food you take from the fridge.”
“And stay out of the basement.”
The basement.
“Because of the Jack Monster,” I said.
My father nodded and sipped his tea.
* * * * * *
Step back about thirty years.
We had moved into the house when I was five, after my grandfather passed away, leaving it to us in his will.  Dad took a job teaching history at the local university, as his father had done before him.  He called it “our legacy.”  I wanted no part in it.
The house was grand: a pine green Victorian with a black roof built at the top of a long hill, beside approximately twenty-five acres of forest.  It had a porch that extended all the way across the front.  Three bedrooms, two baths, an attic and a basement.
The first couple of years living there were peaceful.  I went to school, my father walked to work, and my mother volunteered at an animal shelter.  Dad would come home at the same hour every evening, sit in the living room and watch the news, then join my mother and me in the kitchen where we ate dinner and shared our days.  Everything seemed normal.
It wasn’t until I was older that I became aware that my father spent an inordinate amount of time in the basement with the door locked.  Stranger still, when he wasn’t in the basement, he had even more locks on the outside of the door.  My mother said he was “tinkering in his workshop.”  He’d come up with metal shavings in his clothes and beard or covered with sawdust.  Regularly, brown parcels with no return address would arrive in the mail, and he’d disappear into the cellar with them.  We had weekly runs to Aubuchon Hardware to buy whatever tools he needed.
When a teacher prompted us to write an essay about what we wanted to be when we grew up, I wrote, “I want to be a tinkerer like my dad.”  During the next parent-teacher conference, I showed it off proudly to my parents.  When we got home, my father was clearly agitated.
“It’s not tinkering!” he grumbled as we hung our coats up in the entryway, opposite the door to the basement.
My mother sighed and walked inside, leaving us alone.
“Can I help you with your work, Daddy?”
“Grading papers?”
“No, in the basement.”
He knelt beside me and put his strong hand on my shoulder, gripping it firmly, but gently.
“If I’m successful, someday you can come down.  But for now, you gotta promise me you will never go into the basement.”
“But I want to be a–”
“Promise me.”
I sniffled and struggled to fight back the tears of rejection welling up.  “But why?”
“Because there’s a monster down there.”
* * * * * *
That damned basement.  As a child, the terrible mix of curiosity and fear it generated in me drove me mad with frustration.  Now as an adult, with my father sick and seemingly confined to the couch or bed, I had the chance to once and for all see what he had been working on all those years.  I needed to see what was in the basement, and Jack Monster be damned.
I lay in bed in the guest room, listening to him downstairs as he watched back-to-back cop dramas on the television.  It was going on midnight, and I was starting to wonder if he ever slept anymore when the sound from the TV went quiet, and the house fell silent. I waited, just to be sure he was sound asleep before I started sneaking around.
Stealth was of the utmost importance, but fortunately, I grew up in that house and knew every creaky board or squeaky hinge.  I slid out of bed and crept down the hall to the master bedroom, moving quieter than the mouse when the cat’s on the prowl.  The light from my phone illuminated the room with an eerie, bright glow.  His bed was neatly tucked in and appeared to not have been slept in for days.  I moved silently to his bedside table, where he had always kept a chain of keys for every lock in the house.  The sound they made as I lifted them rang like church bells in my head, and I gripped them tightly to keep them from rattling further.
Successfully pocketing the keys, I crept downstairs, avoiding the noisy steps, and moved like a shadow past my father’s sleeping form on the couch, down the hall, through the kitchen, to the entryway.
* * * * * *
Telling your kid that there’s a monster in the basement naturally leads to all sorts of questions.  How did it get there?  What does it look like?  Why doesn’t it eat you?
At first, I was too scared to ask questions.  There was a monster in the basement.  My father said so.  Case closed.  Stay out of the basement.  Gotcha.  But after the initial revelation did not result in the monster storming upstairs to eat me, I decided I wanted to know more.
“What kind of monster is it?” I asked my father as he did the Sunday crossword at the breakfast table.  Just out of the blue.  You know– come on, Dad, let’s talk about the basement monster over eggs and toast.
“It’s called the Jack Monster.  Eat your cereal.”
“Why does it live in the basement?”
My father sighed and set down the newspaper.  “Because it’s dark down there.”
“There aren’t any lights?”
“There are lights, but there aren’t any windows, and it’s dank and dingy; perfect monster habitat.”
“Why aren’t you scared of it?”
He looked at me.  “I was.”
“When you were a kid?”
“Yeah.”
“Why aren’t you afraid of it now?”
“Look, it’s a long story, and hopefully, you never have to worry about it, so finish eating and get ready for school.”
“But why is it called the Jack Monster?”
“That’s its name.”
* * * * * *
I spent a somber moment staring at the door, fiddling with the keys in my pocket.  Three padlocks stood between me and the basement.  It took several attempts to find the right one on the chain, but eventually, I inserted the correct one into the first lock.  It didn’t turn easily.  Rust and corrosion fought with cold enthusiasm.  It took a bit of strength to work the key, but after half a minute, I felt the housing give a satisfying click and the shackle popped out.
Pocketing the lock, I repeated the steps for the second and third.  Then the deadbolt.  Finally, I turned the knob and opened the door to the basement, slowly, in case the hinges needed oiling.  Stale air wafted up from the darkness.  It reminded me of the stories I’d read about the unearthing of King Tut’s tomb, of how the air had been centuries old and full of ancient germs.  When was the last time my father was down there?
I descended the stairs carefully, holding the railing in case any of the boards were rotted and gave under my weight.  There were no windows in the basement, just as my father had said.  Not even moonlight penetrated the room.  There was, however, a light bulb with a chain by the bottom of the stairs, so I turned that on.  The room was washed in dim yellow light.
The floor of the basement was hard-packed dirt, uneven in places.  The ceiling was high enough that I couldn’t touch it standing up straight, and covered with some sort of thick insulation.  Several thick support columns prevented the far side of the room from being illuminated, but I could see a number of workbenches.  Tools lined the walls: hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, and five different types of wood saws.  Propped against one of the workbenches was a shotgun.
On the nearest work area was a contraption that sent the skin on my arms crawling.  It consisted of two halves of a bear trap screwed to a wood block with a sharp, metal spike protruding from the base.  Several small fan blades were soldered to the spike in a helical pattern.  On the back of the block was a lawnmower engine.  The entire thing was attached to a long metal pole with a ripcord running from the engine to the grip.
“That is not a toy,” I muttered to myself.
As if in response, I heard the rattling of a heavy chain from the shadows in the far corner of the room.  Something was dragging across the dirt floor, behind one of the support columns.
I jumped, feeling like my heart leaped higher than the rest of me.  My stomach twisted and prepared to launch itself up my throat.  My phone, with its tiny little light, became my shield, held out at arm’s length to ward off whatever horror shambled forth.  Only one thought ran through my head.
The Jack Monster.
It was a man.  A middle-aged man, dressed in a torn shirt and boxers.  He limped from the shadows, clutching his leg, which was bound with a wrought-iron shackle attached to a chain that trailed off into the darkness.  His face was bruised and swollen.  Dirt and blood covered his arms.  I noticed a makeshift bandage concealing where two of the fingers on his left hand were missing.
“Pleathe,” he moaned as he limped toward me.  “Pleathe help me!”
“What the fuck?” was all I could muster.
The man collapsed at my feet, clutching my pant leg with his good hand.  As he hunched over, I saw the back of his shirt, shredded with lashes that exposed the meat beneath his skin.  He was sobbing, fumbling in the dust, just trying to stay on his knees.
“He’th a monthter!” he choked through ragged breath.  His jaw was so swollen he sounded like he was talking through a mouth full of cotton balls.
“Who are you?” I asked, dumbfounded.
The man looked up with eyes filled with panic and desperation.
“F-Foley.  Jack Foley.  Pleathe.  Pleathe, get me outta here!”
I tried to step back, but the man held my pant leg, and it sent him sprawling to the floor.  “Did my father do this to you?”
“Yeth!  L-look what he did!  He t-t-took my f-fucking fingerth!” he tore at his hair and waved his bandaged hand up at me.  His eyes were pinwheeling in their sockets.
Jesus, I thought, my father is insane.
“Hold still, and be quiet!  He’s asleep, but he’s right upstairs.”
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” Jack sobbed, tears streaming down his filth-covered face.
I knelt down beside him and studied the manacle clasped onto his calf.  They looked about a hundred years old, but my father had used some solder to write strings of symbols all over them.  The chain was equally old and rusty.  Setting down my phone, I wondered which of the keys belonged to this lock.
The light shone on a pile of blood-soaked clothes.  I’m not talking about the clothes off the man who was weeping in front of me.  I’m talking about three dozen pairs of pants, at least.  And shirts to go with them.  And socks.  And shoes.  And a pile of wallets closest to me.
Wallets.
I got up and left the frangible shell of a man, huddling on the floor by my phone.
“Wha… what are you doing?”
“Hang on a second.”
“Pleeeeathe!  He might wake up!”
I knelt down and picked a wallet off the top of the pile, cracked leather and bloated with business cards.  Inside were credit cards, a gift card to a gas station, photos…
Photos.
Photos of children.  Of a family, smiling together.  A photo of a young man on a driver’s license that read, “Jack T. Polaski.”
“What?”  The other Jack looked over at me.  “Thath not me.”
I dropped the wallet at my feet and picked another one off the pile.
“Jack Grace.”
I went through four more before I felt sure I didn’t need to look any further.  They were all named Jack.  Every single man my father had dragged down there to torture and kill in our basement.  Dozens.  It made no sense.  Where did he find so many people named Jack?  Had this been going on all these years?
“Gemme outta here, pleathe!” Jack whispered loudly, clutching his leg iron and gesturing toward it with his free hand.
I hurried back to his side and handed him the keys.  “It’s one of these.”
He fumbled with the keyring, dropping it for a moment, before shoving key after key frantically into the lock on his binding.  The rest of the horrors of that basement had vanished from his mind, and only his inevitable freedom mattered.
“I’m sorry,” I said, “For all of this.  Use my phone.  Call the police.  I have to confront my father.  Be careful.  Wait here.”
“Yeth.  Yeth, yeth, yeth, yeth, yeth, yethhhh…” the poor man rambled.  His fingers were trembling.  I felt revulsion watching him scramble to undo the manacles.  I wanted out of there.  I wished I had never come down and discovered my father’s secret.  I knew I was doing the right thing, but it was still my father upstairs, the real monster in that house.
And I had to stop him.
* * * * * *
My mother was tucking me into bed.  I had gotten up for the fourth night in a row, crying because of nightmares where a woman with long, black hair terrorized me from my closet.  My mom kissed me on the forehead.  “There’s nothing in your closet,” she whispered, smoothing my hair.  ”There’s no such thing as monsters.”
“What about the Jack Monster?” I asked.
“That’s just your father’s way of keeping you from getting hurt on something in the basement.”
“Have you been in the basement?”
She looked off into the middle distantly.  “No. There’s nothing down there to see.”
“Then why does Daddy keep it locked from the outside?”
She didn’t answer me.  She just petted my head gently and started to sing one of her songs about how much she loved me and how much I needed to go to sleep.
* * * * * *
I knew now why he kept the basement locked from the outside, that son-of-a-bitch.   I stomped up the stairs, listening as the sound of Jack struggling to find the correct key seemed to fade away as I passed the threshold of the door.  Soundproofing.  That was one of the things he’d been working on down there.  No wonder we never heard any screaming or other sounds coming from the cellar.
An unnatural, cold breeze blew past me as I entered the kitchen.  It brushed past like moth wings, and sent a tremor through me.  I was already shaking with a mixture of rage, fear and shame. Shame that neither my mother nor I had made even a modicum of effort to find out what my father was really up to.  How many men – how many Jacks – died begging for mercy because of our apathy?
The living room was black as pitch, but I knew where everything was.  I strode across the room with disgust, over to the couch where my father lay sleeping, and turned on the lamp on the side table, ready with a glare aimed right at his head.
The couch was unoccupied.
I glanced around the room.  All that rage and anger I had just built up spiraled down the drain, leaving only apprehension.  Where had he gone?  His empty teacup sat on the table, and the blanket he’d covered himself with was crumpled in a heap on the floor. Something was off, though; something was wrong.  I picked up the blanket.
It was wet and sticky with blood.
I looked past it, at the carpet.  Red droplets against the green polyester.  A trail of them led out into the hall and up the stairs to the second floor.  I followed them cautiously, every nerve in my body firing off in an escalating sense of anxiety.
“Dad?” I called up the stairs.  Had he hurt himself?  “Dad, are you okay?”
No answer.
Without thinking, I bolted two steps at a time up to the second floor, down the hall, and into the master bedroom, no longer angry, just wanting to make sure he hadn’t harmed himself.  He needed help, and he needed to be stopped, but he was still my father.  Please, Dad, don’t have done something foolish.
I flipped the light switch, bathing the room in fluorescence.  More blood.  Lots more blood.  A deep, crimson stain running down the foot of the bed.  It all looked a sickly brown under the yellow light.  The linens were a tangled mess of sheets and covers, like someone had engaged in an epic struggle on them.  My stomach churned like Charybdis.  In the center of the tangle of sheets, covered with streaked, bloody fingerprints, was my phone, a set of keys, and one pair of twisted, ruined, wrought-iron manacles.  If I hadn’t gotten a good look at them earlier, with their delicately soldered runes, I wouldn’t have recognized the bindings that had kept the beast restrained for so many years.
On the wall above the headboard, the Jack Monster had left me one final message.
DON’T GO IN THE BASEMENT
* * * * * *
What have I done?  How many years had my father spent down there, trying to figure out if the Jack Monster had a weakness? Maybe it went back further than that…had it been there with my grandfather too? Generations of my family, living in this house, trying to kill a single demon while struggling to protect everyone they loved from it.
I called the police from the landline and sat in the kitchen with all the lights on.  A pair of police cars arrived within minutes.  Four uniformed officers.  I showed them the living room, my father’s bedroom, and the message the Jack Monster had left.
“I know this sounds insane, but…yeah, don’t go in the basement.”
“Why?” one asked.
“Because there’s a monster down there,” I told them.
They went anyway, guns drawn.  All four of them.
They’ve been down there for hours now."	9.25	12.0	William Dalphin	03/08/2021
Dracula’s Doom	"Part I
London, 1982
Like a dog come running at his master’s whistle, I RSVP’d yes on an invitation to Vernon Copeland’s Halloween party to view his latest acquisition. A lost piece of cinema from the early ’20s, a screen test hitherto undiscovered, et cetera, et cetera. Copeland was a cinephile and an antiquarian as he was also other things of far less reputable standing. His home, a handsome stucco-fronted townhouse spread over five floors in the plutocratic bowels of Knightsbridge, was stuffed to the rafters with artifacts of historical significance. For the past decade or so I’d occupied the post of two-bit private dick in Copeland’s court of boorish profiteers; in reality, this meant I cashed my not inconsiderable checks as a kind of appropriator cum arm-breaker. Professors, antiquaries, rabbis, philatelists and several prominent Members of Parliament were among those notables who had availed themselves of my services. Missions usually consisted of wresting relics, curios and other articles of virtue from individuals or institutions of especial stubbornness—usually by means of violence, blackmail or intimidation on my part. I’d long lost track of the priceless treasures and objets d’art I’d consigned to the sweet oblivion of Copeland’s private collection.
It was about nine o’clock when I showed up at Knightsbridge. I was wearing my brown double-breasted suit, with white shirt, burgundy tie, matching waistcoat, and my best pair of Oxford brogues. I was tired and needed a shave, and the ache in my lumbar had sharpened like it always did when the weather turned cold. Inside, in the huge barren lobby from which a wrought-iron staircase ascended into the shadows of an upper floor, I shrugged off my coat and handed it to a tight-lipped waiter. I didn’t let him take my hat though. I waited and listened to the muted sound of voices and laughter drifting from somewhere deeper within the house. When the waiter returned he nodded and took me with him along a paneled hall that ended in a pair of big double doors. He ushered me into a large drawing room dimly lit by a rustic stone fireplace in which chestnut logs with the bark still on them smoldered lazily. Autumn rain tapped the leaded bay windows. The air was drugged with the mingled smells of cigar smoke and sandalwood.
I scooped several glasses from a circulating tray of dirty martinis and hors d’oeuvres and banished myself to one of a trio of red leather sofas by the fireplace, where a pair of cozy sodium lamps had been switched on for ambience. The bottle of bourbon I’d killed earlier in the evening was hitting me hard now. But at least it made the scoffing mob of socialites and dilettantes a touch more palatable. As usual, none of those snooty assholes so much as acknowledged my presence; our spheres were as immiscible as oil and water. They guzzled their drinks empty and rattled the ice cubes at the waiters, watching each other along their eyes, ready to be smarmy or odious as the situation required.
I stared at the opposite wall, at the most antique of three previously unknown Francisco de Goya paintings that I’d appropriated from the private collection of a reclusive connoisseur in Zagreb. Or had it been Tirana? I was just about buzzed enough to begin doubting my own recollections. Guy who owned the paintings was a real weirdo, though. I remembered that much. Creepy bastard had a subterranean gallery beneath his rambling hillside mansion; a narrow, low-ceilinged room filled with the most grotesque artworks you could possibly imagine. I tossed down the dregs of another martini and flagged down a morose waiter in a white tuxedo jacket who was carrying a fresh tray. The painting drank the red and amber glow of the sodium lamps. It was a dramatic landscape from a dark and ominous palette. A mountain of black clouds loomed over the blasted wasteland of an ancient stone city; a sea of flaming ruins, portal to Gehenna, Pandemonium, the Vestibule of Hell itself. The more I stared the more the clouds took on the aspect of an unimaginably monstrous creature—a knotted mass of scaled reptilian splendor.
I’d killed a couple more martinis and was still staring at the painting, at the yellowish moon which had now taken on the aspect of a fanged and sphincter-like maw, when I spotted Copeland wading towards me carrying a bottle of booze by the neck and chewing on a pipe stem. The antiquary was cataclysmically drunk. He slouched on the sofa beside me and laid the bottle in my lap. ‘You look shitty, Noah. Like you caught the wrong end of a stick half a dozen times over.’
‘Yeah, well, that’d still be half as many times as you.’
He guffawed and told me to have a drink. ‘That’s a thirteen-year-old scotch,’ he said as he ogled in passing the décolletage of a beautiful creature who might have been half-mortal, half-Hellenic goddess. I chugged from the bottle of scotch. Hot on the heels of said beauty was Tertius Brooke, a once critically acclaimed Kentish poet whose bland pastorals now seemed bound for obscurity. Funny how things go, eh? He wrinkled his nose at the sight of me; that was okay, I was more of a Yeats man anyway. Copeland departed with promises of an imminent return, pushing his way through the milling crowd. I chased a handful of painkillers with another body blow from the scotch and glared at the waiter as he gathered up my small collection of empty martini glasses. I sat for a minute, or two, or ten observing with mild disgust the throng of fustian literati. Despite the pills my body still ached: after half a dozen bullets, and a respectable number of brawls and scrapes—not to mention a seaplane crash off the southern coast of Japan where I broke almost everything that a body could break—I suspected it always would. Body casts and neck braces were like socks and shoes to me, pain a stalwart companion; a constant reminder that flesh was a perishable currency forever indebted to death.
I sat with the bottle clasped loosely in my lap. After a while I began to notice a subtle difference in the atmosphere of the room—an undercurrent of anticipation that hummed like a high-voltage wire. I sat up straighter. A slew of decorous waiters floated from the darkness like moths, flitting among the guests and politely ushering them to plush chesterfields and comfortable old wingbacks. Through a shifting haze of cigar and cigarette smoke I saw the waiter who had collected my empty glasses emerge from behind a curtain on the opposite side of the room, pushing a trolley loaded with a box of film canisters and an ancient Bell & Howell screen projector. The room was already dim as the bottom of an aquarium when a bowing waiter with blonde-white hair decided to kill the sodium lamps; immediately, shadows that crouched in the corners thickened and crept forth. Copeland reappeared and settled in beside me. His features were hellish in the flickering orange firelight. When he leaned over to pat my forearm, red patches burned startlingly in his cheeks and his eyes were just glints of fire in the shadowy mask of his face.
‘Behold, Dracula’s Doom,’ he whispered theatrically. He took a deep drag on his pipe, puffed a leisurely swirl of smoke at the ceiling, then added in a more reasonable tone, ‘Or at least a seven-minute test reel of said.’
The room became a cave suffused with silvery light.
The camera aperture splashed against a paler section of wall where a bookcase had stood until recently. On the title card: attributed to Victor Lipovsky; entitled Dracula’s Doom. Below this, a short string of characters that might have been Arabic or Cyrillic. The film had been shot on muddy thirty-five millimeter and its condition was much deteriorated. The frames flickered, arrived in jittering streams; frequent cigarette burns ate inwards from the corners of the screen. Reality dilated and contracted faster and faster until, in a sudden moment of dislocation, I was sucked into the aperture’s shuttering iris—into a grey, craggy, mist-choked landscape that possessed all the sinister gravitas of a classic Hammer Horror film, where the first scene unfolded.
The fog churned and roiled as it wound through the twisted unpaved streets of a village, past small thatch-roofed peasant cottages with their windows shuttered and barred. A ruined castle loomed on the horizon. The building jutted from a steep, forested hillside. The camera swooped over its clustered maze of turrets and towers where bodies had been impaled upon spires and weathervanes, then panned slowly across a massive lancet window showing a stained-glass knight locked in everlasting battle against the most fearsome archetype of all demon-dragons whose awful eyes harbored eons of blackest night. The knight had snapped off his sword not far from the hilt and didn’t appear to be doing too well.
A bat fluttered past, then another, just in case we still hadn’t gotten the hint.
The screen crumpled into darkness and then the darkness reversed to reveal a cavernous hall that rose to a peak buttressed by heavy wooden beams which looked as though they’d been stolen from an old church. Torches flickered in soot-streaked sconces. Heavy drapes lay tumbled in dramatic folds several yards from the tall windows; again, stained-glass all over the place. Moonlight illuminated a pallid figure scraping away at the strings of a rickety violin. The figure swayed from side to side, erupting in short spontaneous bursts of movement the way a spider might.
My innards lurched. I squirmed in my seat and downed a huge gulp of scotch. The violinist’s expression distorted in the rapturous manner of a satiated addict. His black eyeball rolled at the camera, the pupil devouring the white of the eye and filling the screen—filling my skull with night eternal. The room shrank. The whispering crowd became dry leaves rustled by a stiff autumn wind. From the black and infinite void, the chords of a violin skirled an evil symphony, scratching my ears, my brain. Something rose swiftly from the gloom—something like mist, taking on the shape of a man. I could discern nothing of this figure save for the hideous luminescence of its corpse-like complexion, a deathly pale face touched with a blood-on-snow vibrancy. The violin shrieked a dirge. A nails-on-slate, glacially-shifting sound that rocked me like a middleweight’s left hook. The darkness bled and molted vermillion. Hoarse, stricken screams shrilled and died as exhausted sobs. Shrilled, then died. Shrilled. Died. The thin white figure was laughing in the dark—the most sinister laughter I’ve ever heard. The many-voiced cackle of a raven non compos mentis.
Darkness receded, slinked back into the corners of the screen. The dull points of the violinist’s fangs glinted as he seized the corners of his mouth, and pulled—
A cigarette burn bloomed and ate outwards to the corners of my vision as the film spun off the reel. My sense of utter dislocation faded as the regular space-time continuum reasserted itself, reconstituting at the atomic level. Somebody vomited. Somebody else said, ‘Jesus Christ.’ A deathly silence followed. Then the muttered exclamations of the crowd began to run around the room like rats.
The bottle of scotch was empty as a waterhole in a drought. I flagged a waiter for a drink. He nodded shakily and returned with a whiskey neat; I snatched it from him and downed it in a single gulp. My hand trembled. Ice rattled in the empty glass.
‘What the hell was—Jesus, what did you say it was called?’ I did my best to subdue my rattling nerves, throttling back a more visceral reaction to emote at least a thin veneer of calm.
Copeland stared vaguely past me for a second, rubbing a thumb on his jaw. One of his hands clutched his pipe. Slowly, carefully, he packed it with tobacco, held a match to it and puffed a cloud of smoke. ‘Dracula’s Doom,’ he said around the pipe stem. His dark leathery eyes got hard and steady as shards chipped off Botswanan Agate. ‘A lost Russian flick from the era of silent cinema.’
I rubbed my cheek, the thick, coarse stubble going to beard. The violinist’s sinister tune wheedled its way into my thoughts; a deep itch in the pyramidal cells of my hippocampus, a fusillade of neuronal firing. I had another drink in my hand now. My head swam, slow and peaceful as koi fish in a temple pond. ‘What happened to the rest of it?’ I asked finally.
Copeland puffed smoke and said: ‘Presumed destroyed, until most recently. But I believe—’ Then the rest of the guests came in for the kill, the whole lot of them swarming around Copeland like a shoal of piranhas. I found myself pinned down by the verbal crossfire of a tall, hatchet-faced man in a smart tweed hacking jacket that would’ve made Sean Connery jealous, and Tertius Brooke himself, who was in fine form after an evening of getting shit-faced.
I rose as steadily as my punch-drunk body permitted and split the well-heeled crowd like a banana peel. I melted into the background and spent the next two hours courting sweet, ephemeral oblivion by way of a bottle of Suntory single-malt I found in the scullery. I got my coat and went out through the back and sat down at the top of the narrow dark stairs to the servants’ entrance. I took a long pull from the bottle and looked up at the night sky, at the stars strewn in shining continuum from one end of the heavens to the other, sparkling like flashes of light on the facets of a million celestial diamonds. The garden was gloomy; all I could make out were a pair of wrought-iron Victorian-style lanterns glowing on either side of an oak pergola covered with wisteria. The neighboring houses brooded like tombs. I couldn’t stop thinking about Dracula’s Doom. Nor could I shake the sound of that horrid string music, faint strains of it rising like mist from some black well of my brain.
Then it suddenly occurred to me, on a dim level, what Copeland had said after the picture had ended. What the lizard in the back of my mind had been screaming all along. The unsettling realization chilled me, chased prickles across my body and left my guts in the back of my throat. What lingered in my stomach was the sensation you get when you reach the top of a flight of stairs and instead of the top step there’s only empty space.
I sat there in the womblike dark of that cold October night and listened to the muffled hubbub of voices and laughter drifting out through the half-open kitchen door and thought about that. About how there couldn’t have been any music, or in fact any sound at all—because Dracula’s Doom was a silent film.
Part II
Still London; Still the ’80s
I met Copeland for an all-expenses lunch in March of ’83 and he laid it all out on the table. A swanky French restaurant just off Park Lane, Le Lièvre D’or was the old man’s preferred lunchtime haunt. Today he’d snagged a booth with an admirable view of short skirts and hosiery: a cavalcade of nubile young interns and paralegals perched on the mahogany stools that flanked the far end of the bar. The slick-haired bartender brought Copeland a bottle of red wine labeled Chateau Clos du Notaire and for me a Crown Royal neat with the whiskey quivering at the rim of the glass. Lunch itself consisted of Scottish langoustines in a buttery samphire condiment, a platter of snails with garlic and parsley, a selection of classic French farmhouse cheeses and a roasted saddle of venison hailing from a country estate in Wales.
I ate and glanced casually at the end of the bar. The food was all right. The whiskey tasted clean and fiery. Copeland sucked snails from their ramshorn shells and set the empty carapaces carefully on the silver platter while he endeavored to explain the importance of some out-with-the-ark camera he’d recently acquired at auction. After a few minutes of this, he fished a leather cigar case out of an inner pocket, lighted one of his monogrammed cigars and set it in the ashtray to smolder. He moved his chin at the case. ‘Please.’
I shook my head. ‘Thanks. But I’ve quit.’
He nodded, shrugged. Then he put the cigar in his mouth and leaned back in his chair with his hands clasped together behind his head. He blew smoke straight upwards and watched it spiral towards the distant ceiling. ‘Dracula’s Doom was one of the earliest attempts to bring Stoker’s infamous Count to the silver screen. It predates F. W. Murnau’s Nosferatu by a year or two. Tell me, sir: are you familiar with the filmography of Victor Lipovsky?’
Again, I shook my head.
‘A Russian fellow whose name is at times distorted—some accounts refer to him as Levotsky, others Lavatsky. He cranked out a dozen or so obscure silent films back in the ’10s and ’20s; most of his work is now considered lost.’ Copeland set the smoking cigar down in the ashtray and reached for another snail. ‘It’s thought that Dracula’s Doom was made in Kiev sometime between 1917 and 1919—smack-bang in the middle of the Russian Civil War. Not much freedom back then, either; Soviet filmmaking was very much a state-controlled affair. Rumor says Lipovsky shot his thoroughly unsanctioned vampire flick surreptitiously over a period of just thirteen days. It goes that many of the actors were shell-shocked infantrymen who would later be exiled to remote Siberian penal colonies or confined to psychiatric institutions. Despite being hailed as something of a masterpiece, the film was never widely shown and the reels likely destroyed during the Bolshevik occupation of the city.’
I cut a slice of venison and forked it into my mouth. Pain nibbled at my neck like a prurient lover. I chewed slowly, resisting the urge to swallow a handful of the parti-colored pills in my coat pocket.
‘Oh, so like, Dracula in the Gulag, eh? Sounds interesting.’
‘Something like that.’ Copeland grinned tightly. ‘Naturally, I own an entire vault of vanished motion-picture prints and masters I’m sure many collectors would sacrifice a firstborn to examine. Over the years I’ve managed to obtain copies of Lipovsky’s other works, but Dracula’s Doom has remained . . . elusive.’
‘Until now.’
‘Until the early ’50s, when what purported itself to be an authentic test print surfaced in Bucharest as part of an estate sale for the late Lascar Vacarescu; a hermit cineaste whose particular interest lay in morbid and silent features: London After Midnight, The Golem and the Dancing Girl, The Monster of Frankenstein—the list goes on. Suffice to say his collection was vast, and incredibly valuable.’
‘Define incredibly valuable for me.’
Copeland produced a fancy gold-nibbed pen and wrote a set of numbers on a nearby napkin. A substantial figure, to be sure.
‘Vacarescu died in 1953. A nasty vehicle rollover in the Carpathian Mountains. No identifiable remains. An estranged son of Asian heritage debuted at the funeral as the heir-apparent and stuck around just long enough to auction off dear old dad’s beloved collection. The test reels of Dracula’s Doom were among a sizeable portion of the Vacarescu estate snapped up by an exceedingly wealthy Hungarian baroness, then subsequently looted during the uprising of ’56; they reappeared over a decade later in 1967 at an exhibition hosted by the National Museum of Film, in Bucharest—alongside what was alleged to be an undiscovered print of the full film.’
Copeland put his cigar back in his mouth. A bouquet of sunlight slanted across his face from the left, calling out the network of deep furrows texturing his cheeks and forehead and showing me clearly how drink had made a soft ruin of his heavy but once quite-handsome features. At the bar, an elegant redhead with eight carats of diamond on her finger went off into a peal of laughter; muted strains of chamber music drifted in from somewhere. Abruptly, a line from Yeats floated through my head: Of what is passed, or passing, or to come. I shivered as though somebody had just walked over my grave.
‘Alas, much of the exhibition was turned to charcoal briquettes by a fire in ’72,’ Copeland continued. ‘Which brings me to the chap who auctioned off the screen test: a Slav by the name of Dimas Sekelsky—a certifiable lunatic who claims his great-grandfather was a psychiatric nurse who played a Dr. Seward in the original film.’
I slugged the last of my whiskey and flagged an urbane waiter with glistening hair to set me up with another.
‘What makes you think this Sekelsky guy is crazy?’ I asked, rubbing my aching neck. I studied Copeland through his haze of cigar smoke. ‘And how’d he get hold of the film, anyway?’
‘Sekelsky is quite the man of mystery. You see, he made a series of claims that his forebear hadn’t simply starred in Dracula’s Doom but that he’d actually helped Lipovsky write the script and sell it to his patron. There’s a character in Dracula’s Doom, a schizophrenic violinist who believes himself to be the Count—allegedly, Lipovsky based this Dracula character on a real-life individual detailed in Sekelsky’s great-grandfather’s journals. Claimed that outside of music the fellow’s interest lay in blood rites and eternal life.
‘Which all sounds far-fetched but possible enough, wouldn’t you agree? Only with Lipovsky dead since 1946 and the cast and crew of Dracula’s Doom seemingly vanished into the aether, Sekelsky’s claims fell on deaf ears. That fire at the National Museum of Film? Well, who do you think was on the books as a consultant before he stabbed the director half to death and tried to torch the place? I’ll give you three guesses and you won’t need the first two.’
I chewed this over, then nodded for Copeland to continue.
‘Sekelsky absconded with several artifacts of incalculable value that remain as yet unaccounted for. Its presumed Dracula’s Doom is among them; according to his cellmate, Sekelsky scarcely stopped babbling about it—the blood-hungry abyss, an open wound in the universe itself, et cetera, et cetera.’
The waiter returned with my drink and went away. I took a good gulp of it and said, ‘Cellmate?’
‘Sekelsky just concluded a hard stretch in Gherla Prison, Romania. Got caught at the Serbian border and nailed for arson, robbery and murder.’ Copeland poured the dregs of his third glass of wine down his throat and refilled the glass to the brim. He lifted another snail from the platter and sucked it from its shell with a short slurp. ‘And by just concluded, I mean to say he tore out a guard’s throat with his teeth and absconded into the wilds of the Continent.’
The old man chewed the snail in a manner that called to mind another, more familiar de Goya painting: a crazed, disheveled and monstrous Saturn chewing the arm off one of his sons. I regarded him silently for a moment, deciding whether or not to mention the . . . I’d have called them night terrors, but that wasn’t exactly the right term for the bizarre hallucinations I experienced most evenings. Truth be told, I hadn’t counted more than three or four hours sleep a night since the party and the screening of Dracula’s Doom. But it was more than just nightmares, wasn’t it? I could almost chalk those up to an amalgam of trauma, sleep deprivation and a dray horse’s dose of drugs and booze. What about the noises? The amateur violinist who had apparently taken up residence in a nearby flat where he or she practiced well into the wee hours of the morning (this despite none of my neighbors having heard anything of the sort). Then there was the cold, mirthless laughter that floated up to my window from the courtyard—the laughter of a castrato or a child, or else someone pretending to be one. There were other sounds, too. Giggling. Slithering. Once, behind the closed bathroom door, I swore I’d heard someone whispering a prayer in a foreign tongue.
I had been turning my thick squat whiskey glass around on the dark wooden tabletop. I swallowed the rest of the drink and said, ‘So, this nutjob Sekelsky is holed up somewhere in deepest, darkest Europe with a lost Russian vampire flick of, uh, incalculable value. And as per custom, here I am: the good ol’ private dick who’s played the part of hired gun so many times before—Jesus, the rest writes itself.’
Copeland sipped his wine and nodded. ‘You know what I want, Noah. And you know how deep my pockets run; as always, you’ll be generously rewarded.’
I knew all right. And I thought that maybe, just maybe, if I got my hands on the old man’s film I might be able to sleep without nightmares again.
Part III
Deepest, Darkest Europe
‘May I get you anything else, sir?’
I started and nearly upset my plastic cup of softened ice cubes and flaccid lemon rinds. The cabin windows were roseate, the sky ablaze with orange and purple light burning through layered fields of cirrocumulus clouds. The flight attendant leaned across the sleeping woman on my left to take my empty cup. She was petite and wore a navy two-piece uniform with a dark red scarf around her neck; her lips and nails were a similar shade of red, her young features pancaked under a layer of makeup so thick it might have been poured from a can of varnish.
‘Another one of these, please,’ I said in a slurred voice. Why am I slurring?
‘Sir?’ the attendant graced me with a strained smile.
‘Sorry.’ I felt very drunk and disoriented and thought I might throw up. I took a deep breath to gather a measure of coherency, and said, ‘Can I have another vodka, please?’
To allay any possible concerns, I waited until the attendant had pushed her service trolley further down the aisle before I slammed the last inch of tepid vodka, hair of the dog that bit me. My gorge rose as the plane yawed violently to port and then leveled out and plowed ahead. I slumped against the window, tingling all over and sweating like I was in a sauna—the motion sickness had really worked me over, more so than the effects of the drink.
I closed my eyes and when I opened them, the windows were dusky red and going dark. My neighbor snored gently beside me. The plane shuddered sideways in heavy turbulence and that did it for me. I unbuckled and lurched from my seat, squeezing none-too-gently past my seatmate, whose snoring continued without so much as a hitch.
The nearest facilities were occupied and a couple of women were waiting their turn. I pushed past them and made my way along the aisle to the rear of the plane where, thankfully, the sole lavatory was vacant. I slipped inside and shot the bolt home and dropped to my knees over the toilet, dry-heaving and hugging the edge of the bowl like a childhood pet. The plane shook. My head knocked hard against the plastic wall. I vomited, a gush of acrid bile spilling through a sluice. I clung to the bowl and made animal pleas for mercy. I tried to gather my thoughts, but it was as if my brain had turned to glass and the booze was a sledgehammer; I could feel the shattered pieces rattling in my skull, each reflecting the reflection of another in a dizzying kaleidoscope of images.
‘Oh God,’ I said, and vomited again.
Eventually, sweaty and shivering and weak as a kitten, I pushed myself to my feet and laved cold water over my face at the low plastic basin of the sink. I was in the act of pulling a paper towel from the metal dispenser when the fluorescent strip above the mirror began to flicker rapidly. Then it dimmed and the toilet became red as a darkroom. Between the light’s fierce, staccato flashes, and for an interval of time that lasted far too long, the mirror was full of something dreadful; a surrealist’s impression of someone so tall they’d been forced to double over just to squeeze into the cramped toilet. Their face was ivory-pale. A bloodless wound. A wound in reality itself. Then, an evil chuckle, a sound like dry ice splitting—
Someone cursed and hammered on the door. The deep red shadows drained away and the striplight hummed and blinked coldly overhead. I shut my eyes tight and opened them and wiped the sweat off my face with the back of my hand, still a little dizzy. The acrid taste of vomit lingered. I hawked, spat into the sink and rinsed my mouth with chlorine-flavored tap water.
When I opened the door there was a big reddish man with a prizefighter’s nose and a garden of broken veins in his florid cheeks standing outside. ‘What’s the matter, guy,’ he drawled. ‘You full of bricks or something?’
He had thirty or forty pounds on me, but I didn’t care. I was running on a terrific vodka-buzz and, more importantly, the adrenal response of whatever the hell I’d just seen in the toilet. My bones ached and I was more than a little green around the gills. Didn’t matter. I could still put my fist through this bozo’s face; except I couldn’t, because in the B-side to the current universe I’d leave half his teeth on the floor only to find the Romanian police waiting for me upon arrival. So instead I sucked it up and returned to my seat, where my seatmate still snored slept with her chin on her chest.
* * * * * *
Once the plane had landed, I rented one of the new Mercedes-Benz 380SLs in a compellingly nondescript shade of grey and drove to the address of Copeland’s contact through a countryside that might have been a scene from a Cézanne painting come to life: lush, arsenical-green fields paced the road for improbable distances and were beset by tractors and hay balers; barns, houses, and the occasional church slid past, all set back from the road in neat tactile pastures and all painted the same hard clean uniform white. In the west, late-afternoon sunlight coagulated over the cool blue ridges and folds of a jagged spine of mountains.
Copeland’s contact was a man named Alexandru. He was a thin, lean-jawed chap with enormous hands which he kept folded in his lap most of the time he talked to me. He occupied a rundown yellow-and-white farmhouse that was quietly sinking into the curve of a turgid river. An old wooden wheel languorously turned the water and a satellite dish gleamed atop the crumbling roof, alien as some bizarre deep-sea flora among the split shakes and rotted lathing.
Alexandru sat at a wide wooden trestle table chewing a pastrami sandwich. He was stripped to the waist and awfully, awfully pale, as if he’d gone overboard donating blood to the bank. I sipped a sour local beer he’d fetched for me from somewhere deep inside the gloomy old house. Untrimmed tree branches threw dark bas-relief shadows through windows that desperately need reglazing. Rafters ribbed the ceiling like the ridged palate of a dog’s mouth.
A black .357 revolver lay on the table near my right hand beside a box of shells. I picked it up and examined it. The metal was old and worn, but the serial numbers had been filed off the frame and trigger guard, and when I cocked it and spun the cylinder the empty chamber still lined up under the hammer. Satisfied that the piece was in good condition, I let the hammer back down with my thumb, peeled half a dozen wrinkled banknotes from the rubber-banded roll in my pocket and tossed them on the table where they were crumpled by a big heavy hand. I put the revolver away and returned the wad of notes to my trouser pocket; plenty more where that came from, anyway—Copeland always made sure I traveled flush. I drank another beer while the day drew on strange and silent. An old war film played on the television. Somebody was torturing somebody. Somebody else was being burnt to a crisp. The light on the windows became the ghostly radiance of twilight, then dusk.
Supper was tomato soup warmed on a hotplate and served with crusty bread and several fingers of Țuică, the country’s national drink. After we’d finished eating Alexandru rolled a couple of joints; soon, the pungent odor of marijuana swirled the cloistered air. I began to feel faint and dizzy. My thoughts swam, disjointed, while Alexandru regaled me with Baba Yaga legends and tales of wolf-like vampires called pricolici that rose from the grave to devour the sun and moon. At length, talk turned to the matter at hand. Alexandru rose and disappeared into the kitchen; there followed a series of thuds, a crash and clatter of pots and pans. He returned with an innocuous manila folder and laid it on the table.
The folder was stuffed with goodies: reports, photographs, mimeographed medical notes and procedural documents. Numerous memos between a Dr. Mihail and a Warden Maksim comprised a sheaf of typewritten letters. The medical records were gibberish to a layman’s eyes; likewise, the correspondence between the two apparatchiks proved equally inscrutable.
One such article (presumably translated second-hand from the Romanian) read:
Dr. Emil Mihail
Re: Inmate #1-447783, Inmate #3-874322
Further to your previous letter, I have enclosed statements from Officers [J_______] and [R_______]. Please see also my reply to Questions 13 & 28.
Inmate #3-874322 continues to maintain vital signs with active medical support but remains otherwise unresponsive. Unfortunately, we have as yet been unable to locate the lost hepatic tissue. It is therefore presumed that said matter was consumed during Inmate #1-447783’s attack.
Yours,
Warden Gregory Maksim
Gherla Penitentiary               
Dozens more like that. It begged the question of why Sekelsky hadn’t been tied to a post and shot. I removed the photos from the folder and spread them in a crescent on the table in front of me. I lifted one and looked at it. Sekelsky had black goat’s eyes framed by a welter of hair; the shadow of a beard just beginning to grow blurred the edges of his face. He wore dirty Army fatigues and muddy boots. I put the photo back on the table and picked up another one, a glossy three-by-five of an iron-haired gent in rimless spectacles and a tweed blazer. I looked at the back of the photo and read: Director Wilhelm von Braun/National Museum of Film, BUH.
At last, a lead. Alexandru confirmed it for me—turned out Herr Director had actually survived Sekelsky’s attack and was still in the museum business to boot. Next stop: Bucharest proper.
That night I dreamt of wolves. Monstrous and slavering, ripped straight from the pages of Stoker’s seminal tale of preternatural horror. Then it was bats. Huge red-eyed fuckers. Despite my nightmares I woke slowly, reluctantly, in the coils of a down sleeping bag. My eyes stared at the high ribbed ceiling, at the cold silver moonlight smeared across the windows. Suddenly I sat upright. Something moved covertly in the room. Something made of shadows. I fumbled for the holster with my left hand and drew the revolver with my right. Too late. The moon flared; a splayed hand emerged from the darkness—a huge, chalk-white spider undulating its legs. The hand crooked its long, spindly fingers and reached for me, drew me down into the fathomless black catacombs of night.
In the morning I recalled a fragment of the dream. Five seconds later it was gone and I was left wondering why I’d fallen asleep with a gun in my fist. No sign of Alexandru, however. I waited a while but he didn’t show. So, I helped myself to a hearty breakfast of bread and cold cuts and departed the farmhouse around 10 a.m. As I jounced the Merc along the deeply rutted trail that led to the main road, my gaze was repeatedly drawn to the rear-view mirror. To the coffee-colored Volkswagen Jetta parked next to the aforementioned building.
I sped towards Bucharest, chewing things over. As for Alexandru? If I was honest I didn’t care a jot for his whereabouts. He’d turn up in the end; I knew from experience that bad pennies always did.
Part IV
Dracula’s Doom
‘Director von Braun is on annual leave,’ the lady at reception informed me with a frosty smile. Her voice was dry and husky, with a note of impatience in it. I thanked her and retreated across the cavernous foyer under a paneled glass ceiling that vaulted to imposing heights. I walked past a poster of Lon Chaney Jr. as the wolfman looming over a supine, buxom figure, and another for H. G. Wells’ Invisible Man, whose bandaged head in half profile recalled the visage of some strange pale djinn. I wandered around, regarding with feigned interest the glass exhibit cases and the writing upon their placards until I spotted a cleaner, a tanned young man who looked a little underfed and a little dirty, trundling his squeaking cartload of mops and brooms towards a distant toilet.
I followed him inside and took a mop from the trolley and wedged it under the door handle. I was three or four inches taller than him and a hell of a lot broader in the shoulders, yet I could see it in his eyes that he was gathering himself to move. I smiled a small, grim smile—ballsy kid for sure. But once I’d greased the rails, so to speak, he positively oozed cooperation.
Apparently Director von Braun had been on annual leave for quite some time; so long, in fact, that his return was no longer expected. Naturally this meant that his mailbox was positively overflowing with important correspondence. And was there, perchance, a forwarding address for any of these epoch-making compositions? Out came the roll of bills. I peeled off a generous amount, and no less than ten minutes later found myself slipping a letter addressed to Herr Director’s private estate into my blazer pocket.
* * * * * *
The von Braun family mansion was situated on the outskirts of Bucharest, an ivy-lashed Queen Anne Victorian restored, if not completely renewed, to a measure of its former splendor. Oak trees loomed against the grey belly of the sky. Water glistened far back beyond their trunks. The house had turrets and towers, dormers, wrap-around balconies and probably a few less windows than Buckingham Palace. I parked fifty feet away on a wooded shoulder where the road ended. I climbed from the Mercedes and leaned against the frame while the engine ticked until the pain in my lower back dulled from a fireworks display to a fistful of sparklers. I checked the action on the .357, holstered it against my left ribs and buttoned my coat over it.
The estate was hemmed in by a twelve-foot wrought-iron fence with spear-like finials and towering stone gateposts shaped like rearing horses. The horses’ manes had crumbled, their chiseled flanks crept by green moss and dead vines. The gates were closed and padlocked but I went in through an iron door set into one of the massive stone uprights; and by went in, I mean I wrenched the door back and forth until the rusted chain securing it snapped. A winding flagstone driveway climbed several hundred feet to the house between tall sculpted hedges that had gone to seed and old weatherworn caryatids that stood like ghosts on their stone blocks. The driveway ended in a wide circle with a sunken garden in its center; this garden was dominated by an ornate three-tiered fountain with a kneeling woman of stone weeping atop its central plinth. The surface of the oblong fountain pool was thick with virid slime and pond scum, clogged with stone water lilies and dead leaves. An eternity of dead leaves.
I walked over to the only car that was parked beyond the garden. It was a black Bentley, rebodied in the classic 1950s style, with a plush red interior and shiny silver louvers big enough to see the engine through. There was dried mud on the Bentley’s plates and more mud splattered above the wheels. I shaded my eyes to look inside. The key was still in the ignition.
I wasn’t surprised to find the heavy wooden double doors slightly ajar. I poked my head through, carefully. A crack of light seeped past the threshold to illuminate several feet of wine-colored carpet and, in the deeper shadows, the foot of a wide old-fashioned staircase. My gut and every other part of me insisted this was an ignis fatuus—a foolish fire of the highest order.
Instead I made for a side entrance; jimmied the lock, natch. Inside, I prowled a network of gloomy corridors barely illuminated by a series of recessed lamps. Far off a thin scraping sound slithered out and lost itself among the silence. The way got darker. I squinted to discern the inchoate forms of suits of armor and moth-eaten pennants, the stuffed and mounted heads of wild boars, wolves and bears. There was a heavy smell of dust and varnish and beyond that a quiet earthy smell which evoked some vague notion of primitive man.
I skirted the lobby and mounted the staircase to the upper floors. At the head of the staircase I followed what seemed to be a mile of green carpet along a shadowy corridor with formidable floor-to-ceiling paneling, upon which hung a series of oil paintings so dark they were almost black. I paused to inspect one of them. It took me a while to make out what it was, but as the image gained clarity I saw that it was a stiffly posed portrait of a guy in a suit. There was something wrong with his head, though; it was deformed, misshapen; his face was too many faces, melded one to the other, and they were fanged faces surmounted by porcine snouts. The small bronze placard underneath the painting read: The Stranger on the Road to Erasmus. Damned thing gave me the willies. I didn’t stop to examine the rest of the series.
The corridor ended in a T-shaped junction. Nothing moved in the dingy hall on the left. On the right, in the opposite direction, a wedge of muddy light seeped past the edge of an almost-closed door. I stood like a statue and listened. Someone was mauling a violin. The sound scratched my cerebrum like a thousand fingernails. I made my way down the hall, thought about drawing the revolver but didn’t. The door opened quietly and I was looking in on the polished wood interior of a brooding study with a tall double-arched bay window and rearing cabinets of antique projectors and film canisters, the labels of which had yellowed to illegibility. A deep leather armchair had been dragged into the middle of the room, and in it was Director von Braun himself, utterly transfixed while Dracula’s Doom flickered on the opposite wall. He was sitting very straight, with his hands grasping the arms of the chair. His eyes were strained wide; they were all iris, and shone madly in the stuttering light.
I went over and stopped the projector. The wall went dark. I wound the film back onto the reel and slid it off the spindle into an unmarked metal canister. Herr Director drooled and whimpered in animal dread. There were trickles of blood at the corners of his eyes and his iron hair had turned completely white, like Harker’s after his visit to Castle Dracula.
Mission accomplished, I was eager to get the hell out of dodge. I left the good Director to the darkness and retraced my steps through the maze of corridors. The way branched and branched again. I took a left and then a right and had paused, unsure of where I was or in which direction I should proceed, when, quite suddenly, a loud smell of wet earth rolled over me. Sekelsky called my name from somewhere nearby. I knew it was him and kept quiet while I unbuttoned my coat. But it was no good, and the revolver was barely in my hand when he dropped me like a bad habit. I rolled onto my back and saw the bastard hefting some sort of studded club which wouldn’t have looked out of place in a medieval armory. The revolver jumped and flame spouted from the barrel. Blood spurted from Sekelsky’s forehead. He grinned at me through his matted beard and clubbed my left forearm. I hissed through my teeth as an electric jolt of pain shot through me.
Sekelsky pried the gun from my fist and sent it skating, almost snapping my fingers in the process. A large serrated knife leaped into his hand from somewhere. He leaned in close and the green stench of rancid meat invaded my nostrils, gagging me. ‘Reality is just a door,’ he whispered. ‘After all my searching, all my orisons to the dark, I finally realized that all I needed to do was knock.’ He chuckled, weighing the knife in his hand. Then he went to work on my leg.
My feet drummed a frantic tattoo on the wooden floor. I tried and failed to tamp down a scream. I wanted to put this fucker on his knees and break every bone in his body, but my right leg was a blazing pillar of fire and the rest of my muscles were hardening to bags of cement as if I’d just gone ten rounds with the Motor City Cobra. My vision had composed itself into a tunnel, at the small end of which floated Sekelsky’s face, ghastly pale in contrast to the glistening black blood decanting from his forehead. The agony in my leg flared brighter—I assured myself that pain, like everything else in this strange and cursory world, was inconsequential. That flight of fancy lasted all of a few seconds until I was wrenched back to the reality of my situation. And when, after a time, my consciousness finally decided to call it quits, all that remained was darkness, and nullity, and the dead march of Sekelsky’s disembodied voice echoing in the void.
Part V
London, October ’83
I swallowed a palmful of colorful M&Ms and chased them with a vodka on the rocks; if I hadn’t been a hardened drunk before Bucharest, I certainly was now. The clock on the mantle chimed the hour. Above it, a mirror showed a middle-aged man in a wrinkled brown suit, with a tired face full of shadows and a thick white scar across his throat. I stared at myself for a moment longer. Then, with a sweep of my arm, I hurled my empty tumbler at the mirror. Glass flew. A thin sliver sliced my cheek like a razorblade; blood oozed from the cut and crawled down a deep line at the corner of my mouth. Sekelsky’s words came back to me then, as I dabbed at the cut with my handkerchief. Blood is just a metaphor, Noah. The alkahest of the abyss itself. The blackest reaches that hide behind the veil of flesh.
I had another drink or two. Gave it ten more minutes before I lifted my cane off the table, got hold of my briefcase with the other hand, leaned weight on the cane, and stood up. I limped out of the flat and made my way slowly down the hall, jabbing the cane into the burgundy fiber carpet. The lift at the end of the hall was small and mirrored. I rode it down to the lobby, studiously avoiding my reflection in the polished walls for fear of stirring up all manner of things best left alone.
I felt woozy and expansive from a lethal cocktail of booze and pills. Perhaps that’s why, when the lift the doors opened, reality skipped a beat and I found myself climbing the colonnaded steps of Copeland’s front porch. I jabbed at the doorbell until a waiter in a werewolf mask and a white tuxedo admitted me. The cavernous lobby was decorated with faux cobwebs, large rubbery spiders and a coterie of plastic skeletons. Somewhere further inside I could hear the muffled thumping sound of loud music. A valet dressed as a sheet blown loose from a washing line floated over. Had the gentleman driven this evening? No, the gentleman hadn’t—shocker, that, given my current condition.
The werewolf led me to the drawing room. A disco ball strobed, and I spotted Batman, Superman and even a few Star Wars cameos among the dancing guests. I went over to the bar where a couple of zombies were chewing the fat with someone dressed in a grey boiler suit and a smooth plastic William Shatner mask a la John Carpenter’s Halloween. I sat down on a red stool, leaned my cane against the bar and ordered a whiskey sour. The barman was lavishly dressed in a black suit, had his hair slicked with oil and a pair of plastic fangs on full display. The ivory-white paint on his face and neck crept beneath his collar—thankfully, there wasn’t a violin in sight. I signaled Dracula for another drink. He showed me his fangs and stooped beneath the bar. After a while I got up again and inched my way through the crowd until I was back in the hall. Despite my best attempts at senselessness, the pain in my phantom leg was scarcely blunted by its absence.
Maybe an eon or two passed before I found Copeland, chatting with a former Secretary of State at the threshold of the French doors that led into the library. There was a flash of pity in his eyes, coupled with the remote speculation of a lepidopterist studying a speared moth—wondering how it was still alive.
‘Noah, old chap; it’s good to see you back on your feet—’ His mouth ticked in a grimace and his lips worked silently as he realized what he’d said.
I nodded and sipped my whiskey. An instant of silence stretched between us, heavy and all-consuming as a black hole. The erstwhile Secretary of State hurriedly excused himself and fled.
‘Well,’ Copeland said at last, looking anywhere but at my missing leg. ‘I hear you’ve got something for me.’
I showed him my teeth and handed him the briefcase.
His eyes widened. ‘Is it—’
‘The complete article. From beginning to end.’ He didn’t ask me about the gravelly huskiness of my voice, about the nasty scar across my windpipe. I’d brought him Dracula’s Doom as promised. That was all that really mattered.
‘Great Scott,’ he said. He jiggled his pipe between his lips and straightened his jacket. ‘I’ll have Maurice bring your check immediately.’
I killed the last of the whiskey and sucked my gums while Copeland barked orders at a pair of waiters. Then, a little at a time, his voice faded until only silence issued from his mouth. Within moments every sound was hushed or otherwise held in abeyance—the world became a silent film devoid of subtitles. And then I heard it. The clarion moan of a violin drifting through that unearthly hush, echoing from a far more remote locale than Vernon Copeland’s drawing room.
I shut my eyes and when I opened them the hall was dark save for a dim red effulgence polluting the blackness. And something was approaching from within the light. Moving or hovering with alarming speed. So pale. So deeply red. A macerated wound with a bloody radiance leaking from its depths—and a face like a porcelain death mask hovering in the air, a mask with a cruel, rapacious smile playing on its lips. The violin sawed a semitone higher, driving an icy stake through what was left of my mind, my sanity. The bloody light flared scarlet and crimson like rays from a punctured sun. Time burned to ash and the ashes scattered in the void. I shook with crazed laughter as the world came loose of its moorings. A moment later, in a sudden dislocation of memory, I found myself back at Le Lièvre D’or, back in March of the previous year. I forked a slice of venison into my mouth even as Copeland—who, in the B-side to my current psychosis, was screaming uncontrollably, singing a hymn of horror to the face of a ravenous abyss—licked his lips and said, ‘Good God, Noah. If I could lay my hands on the full version of Dracula’s Doom­—now that would be a Halloween party for the ages.’"	9.91	11.0	Craig Groshek	03/04/2021
Hell is Heaven to the Demons	"Justice isn’t blind.  If she cannot see, then it’s simply because she doesn’t care enough to look.  She turned away that dark night my sister was attacked where even the moon and stars must have hidden their faces in shame.  From all accounts, it was an anonymous act of brutality: an impulsive flight, a brief struggle, the humiliation of rape, and then the lifetime of silent nightmares that must surely follow such depraved violence.
I’ve heard it’s a common story where the lonely roads meet beyond the protective halo of street lamps.  For all the virtues we profess, there is a savagery dormant in us, waiting only for our fellow man to blink.  It is easy to be noble while someone is watching, and the fear of judgment may yet steady our course.  In solitude, the moral compass will lose its bearing, replaced by whichever base instinct can scream louder than our pounding blood.
It is some consolation that I found the one who valued his greed over human dignity.  Through the course of these confessions, you will see that I am no better than the animal I hunted, so I will waste no time professing my merit now.  I buy substances from a man who knew everything that happened in his neighborhood, and like anyone who seeks profit from another’s misfortune, he was willing to sell me the name I required.
I found the rapist when he returned to the street my sister suffered upon, pacing and circling like a hungry animal haunting the doorstep of his last meal.  He didn’t see me coming, and I made no sound nor spoke no word save for the poetry my bullet inscribed in his skull.  I should have departed at once, but the satisfaction that his last throes of life promised lured me into complacent voyeurism.  I stayed to tell him that my sister sent her love, hoping to purchase her closure with the death rattle rising in his throat.  I wasn’t expecting repentance, nor did I receive it.
“It wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last,” were his final words to reach living ears.
I have no one to blame but myself and my zealous retribution for failing to notice that he didn’t work alone.  They were on top of me in moments, wrestling me to the ground and stomping my gun away from my shattered hand.  Knives punctured my back and neck, leaving great sucking wounds that inhaled the night air; wounds breathing in place of my lungs, which were swiftly filled with blood.  There weren’t any magnanimous thoughts or profound revelations as the light went out.  One moment there was simply light and pain and noise…
And then nothing.
And then nothing.
And then…I opened my eyes to find I was no longer of this world.  I knew at once, despite the fact that I was sitting at a quite ordinary wooden desk in a room no larger than a janitorial closet.  On the desk was a piece of paper, and on the paper was a question, and in that question was written my fate for eternity:
Welcome to Hell.  Would you like to:
1) Remain Human?  You will be tortured by those who became Demons.
2) Become a Demon?  You will torture those who remained Human.
P.S. If there aren’t enough people to volunteer to remain Human, they will be chosen randomly.
I do not believe it is within my nature to torture anyone.  Even my sister’s abuser received death as fast as an executioner’s ax.  But no more could it be said it is within my nature to receive torture: as unnatural a human construct as can be imagined.  But if I had to choose—as I’m sure many of you would have done so far removed from the judgment of both man and God—then I choose to accept my new home and dawn the mantle of Hell I was offered.
I steeled myself against the horrendous transformation I pictured, imagining razor talons growing from my bones to rip holes in the flesh or an entropic decay to wrack my body until my skin ran down my face like candle-wax.  No physical transformation came over me, though, a phenomenon which I can only account to the Devil’s ironic sense of humor.  I knew it from the first moment the floor dropped underneath to fling me down into the charnel realm, however.  I was a Demon now.
And it was Heaven to me.  I expected the first time to be harder.  The woman was presented to me in perfect physical health.  I haven’t noticed any discrepancies in age since I’ve arrived—everyone looks to be in their mid-20s here.  The room was sealed, and I was given an hour to work on her.  I find it distasteful to dwell on exactly what I did, but I remember rationalizing it cleanly with the knowledge that she was only here because she deserved it.  Never mind that I was here too—never mind that it could have been me randomly chosen—never mind that she could have volunteered to suffer like this to spare another.  She was in Hell, and it was my job to make sure she knew it.
It wasn’t until I’d finished that I learned the second rule to this infernal game.  Once the hour of punishment had been completed, the human is offered a choice: they can get revenge on me, or they can accept their pain and continue their journey.  Those who refuse the chance to retaliate shall be incrementally elevated until, at last, their soul is cleansed and they are set to be reborn on Earth.  If, however, they choose to turn the torture on me instead, I will be nourished by the pain and descend further along the dark road I have chosen.  For each blow inflicted upon me, my skin hardens, my muscles tighten, and my power will flourish.
It didn’t take long for me to realize how to properly play.  The only way for me to progress was to inflict a punishment so foul and induce a hatred so deep in my victim that they choose revenge over the quality of their immortal soul.  And progress I must, for untold centuries of this game repeated has refined some Demons into legendary masters of their craft.  Those Demons have carved out kingdoms for themselves in this infernal domain, and through their countless successes have transformed themselves into towering behemoths of apocalyptic ability, shattering the landscape with their tread and sending their lessers into groveling servitude.  Since the moment I chose to become a Demon, the gates of absolution have been closed to me forever.  It may be my fate to dwell in this realm, but it was my choice to rule it.
And so I went to work honing my skill.  It wasn’t enough to simply batter the humans into submission; if I was to force their hand against me, I had to get inside their mind, caressing and nurturing their spirit into one of mindless wrath.  I learned to expose the subconscious dread lying dormant that even the bravest dare not shed light on.  I mastered the art of wetting my brush in nightmares to repaint their memories until all they once knew of life was corrupted by my influence.  I promised false salvation, or deceived them into thinking they had escaped, or spoiled their loved ones until they could not contain the anger I imbued within them.
But I didn’t stop there.  I studied the ancient texts of Demonic lore recounting the torment of dying stars from the beginning of time.  I served under the foulest creatures I could find, watching their methods and improving upon their design.  Experimentation, research, and endless practice refined my mastery over the subtle art until I could induce a pain so exquisite that Angels would shed their wings for the chance to smite me down.  And ever I grew stronger, building a devoted following of my own to gather more humans, ever inventing and facilitating the process of extracting unbearable anguish.  My human form twisted into a sentient shadow to reflect the pervasive nature of my approach, each victory making it that much easier to dismantle my prey.
And I loved every second of it.  I relished in my progression and thought I could live here until the end of time, prospering and expanding my reign to all corners of the nether realm.  Perhaps one day I would supplant the Devil himself, designing my own games to watch the universe fold and decay beneath my guiding hand.  And perhaps I would have continued this road forever, had it not been for the fateful encounter where I finally met my match.
A human was pushed into the room with me, and the door closed behind.  I had an hour to play, but I wanted more.  It was the man who murdered my sister: infuriatingly smug and dismissive of my ability to break his spirit.  I thought I would enjoy this more than anything, but to my mounting dismay, he stubbornly resisted my influence.  He remained passive through the acid wash of his nerves.  His mind did not falter as I summoned the image of his father’s lamentations against him.  Every trick, every torment, every mental ravaging left him smirking, until with exasperation I resigned myself to goad him into action.
“You must feel cheated.  Forced to remain human at the mercy of every lowly criminal who cares to punish you.”
“I wasn’t forced,” he replied.  “I made the choice.”
“Then you’re an idiot who deserves what he gets.”
“And what I’ll get is freedom.  I told you this wasn’t the first time, and that it won’t be the last,” he said.  “I’ve been to Hell so many times that it bores me.”
So that was his secret.  He had gotten out before.  He knew how to play the game. But it didn’t matter, because no one played it like I did.
“So you won’t retaliate?” I asked.  “No matter what I do?”
He shook his head, the smirk unaltered.  “I’m going back to Earth.  And when I do, I’m going to remember this like I always do.  I’m going to wait until I’ve grown strong again.  And just for this, I’m going to find your sister, and I’m going to do it again.”
I had almost forgotten about my sister.  About the world above, filled with its myriad of joys and sorrows.  I missed her in that moment; I missed being alive.  And as much as I enjoyed the role I had carved for myself here, I wanted to be back again.  The thought that this monster would patiently wait out his trials, cheating the system over and over to return to his life of sin; it made me sick.  The tables had turned, and all the hatred I sought to pour into him was rushing into me instead.  I wanted nothing more than to flay him down to the core of being and set such a fire in what remained to burn for all of time.  But even if somehow I could force his hand against me; even if I broke him so badly that he never escaped, I would still be here forever.  And I hated him, and I hated myself, and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done to hold on to that hatred and turn it aside.
And harder still to let him walk away.  To bide my time, sending the weakest demons in my possession so that he might easily resist their influence.  Watching, and waiting, and even helping my sister’s attacker elevate through the Hell until the time of his salvation was at hand.  It was hard, but it was worth it, because that is when I chose to strike.
I had already learned to infiltrate the mind in my pursuit of torture, and through my mastery I infiltrated the spirit as well.  I hid within his soul when his judgment was passed, concealing my hatred within his hatred, tempering my fire with his calculating patience.  And when that soul was whisked away, I traveled with it, sleeping so softly within his dreams that even he did not know he bore me as his silent passenger.  Until the day when he was born again on Earth, and I with him.
The struggle was violent but brief.  It is easy to wrestle an infant’s mind from them, and when the child’s eyes opened, it was I who looked out.  He may resist me yet, but I bear with me all the subtle crafts I have honed in Hell, carrying them to Earth where they can be put to better use.
You see, Hell is Heaven for the Demons, but all the worst of us have found our way back home."	9.83	12.0	Tobias Wade	02/14/2021
The Opalesque	"I don’t know exactly how this story started. It was already in motion well before I became aware of it. My involvement in it began with Christian and Philip: Christian, who was always late, and Philip, who was always early.
Those two were part of our same friends group, but as you might expect they often passed like ships in the night. It was even a joke that they were the same person, like Clark Kent and Superman, and that’s why you never saw them in the same room together. Obviously they weren’t, and in fact we routinely hung out with both of them at the same time, but if either of them brought that up we’d just accuse one or the other of being a paid actor hired to throw us off the scent.
So the night of the dinner party, the night of the attacks, it wasn’t any surprise to anyone that we were several hours in and Christian wasn’t there yet. Nor was it any particular surprise when Philip announced that he had an early morning ahead of him and was heading home. He was always the first one to tap out of any social gathering. It was really convenient, honestly. He clearly felt no social stigma about declaring that he’d had enough, and it freed the rest of us up to leave whenever without being the one who bailed out early.
Phil said his goodbyes, and then it was just the five of us: me, Hamish and Charlene, and Silvio and Abram. No one there was the kind to make me feel like a fifth wheel, but I definitely knew that I was the only one there not coupled up. I was just thinking that maybe I should call it an early night and follow Phil out the door when Christian showed up.
He entered with his usual gusto, banging open the door and loudly declaring, “Now it’s a party! Friends, you won’t believe what I’ve found!”
“Is it a watch?” Silvio asked pointedly. “We finished the dinner party over an hour ago.”
“Ah, you only finished the dinner part. Now we’re at the party bit! Anyway, we both know you didn’t set a place for me.”
It was true, Silvio and Abram had not. We would have made room for Christian at the table if he’d been there on time, of course, and certainly he would have gotten food, but there really hadn’t been many leftovers as it was. We all knew he was never going to be there to eat it.
“As an apology for my tardiness and an attempt to win my way back into your good graces, I have brought wine,” Christian said, producing two bottles from a bag slung over his shoulder. “And another gift which I discovered on the way here, but which I will only unveil once I have had a chance to properly set the scene.”
Silvio accepted the bottles with a nod of thanks and carried them over to the bar. “I assume you’d like the first glass from your gift?” he asked as he uncorked the first bottle.
“Well, I’d hate for you to think it might be poisoned!” laughed Christian. “I’m merely demonstrating that I wouldn’t give you anything I wouldn’t drink myself.”
Silvio passed a glass over to Christian. He sniffed it, sampled it, and declared it good. “Fit for my hosts!” he boomed. “And as you can see, no unexplained rashes or foaming at the mouth.”
“The two classic signs of poisoning,” said Charlene.
“Well, I’ve never been poisoned, so I’m only guessing. The point is: drink up, friends!”
Silvio poured glasses for us all and handed them around.
“Only six?” asked Christian. “None for good Philip?”
Silvio cocked an eyebrow at him. “Is this your way of saying that you’d like a glass for each of your personalities? You still only have one mouth.”
“We’re different people!” Christian protested. “As you’ll see shortly when he gets back from the bathroom, or wherever he is.”
“Uh-huh,” said Hamish. He made air quotes with his fingers. “‘Phil’ left just before you got here. As if you didn’t know, totally-different-person-than-Phil.”
Christian looked confused. “Okay, no, but seriously. He’s really not here?”
“You know you two run on different schedules,” Charlene said.
“Right, yeah, but his car’s still outside.”
This revelation was met with confounded silence from all of us.
“Huh,” Charlene said after a moment. “Maybe he was just getting ready to leave as you pulled up, and you just didn’t see him in the car?”
Abram got up from the couch and crossed to the front window. He peered out, cupping his hands around his eyes to block out the light from the living room.
“No, Christian’s right,” he reported. “His car’s still there.”
We all got up to look, as if we might see something different. Sure enough, Phil’s car sat in the yard with everyone else’s, still and silent. We could see no sign of movement inside.
“I’m going to go make sure he’s all right,” said Abram, putting on his shoes. The rest of us followed suit, curious to see what was going on. Armed with our cell phone flashlights and our glasses of wine, we traipsed out into the night to see what our friend was doing.
I don’t know what I expected. To see him changing a tire, maybe, or taking a nap in the backseat. Certainly he had to be somewhere in the vicinity of the car. Where else would he go? We were easily twenty miles outside of town. The house was surrounded by acres of woods. The nearest neighbor was at least a mile down the road.
And yet the car was empty and still locked. I peered inside just in case, but saw nothing more than a coffee cup in the cupholder and a sweatshirt folded up on the passenger seat. There was nowhere for Philip to hide inside the car, even if he’d had any reason for wanting to do so.
“Maybe he got an Uber?” Abram asked uncertainly. “We all drank some at dinner. Maybe he didn’t want to drive.”
It seemed unlikely. None of us had seen him call for a rideshare, and surely if he had he would have waited inside the house with us and left when the driver arrived. Still, no other option made any sense at all, so I slowly began to talk myself around to believing it.
Then Hamish said, “What’s this on the ground?”
We all gathered around to look. He was near the trunk of Phil’s car. His flashlight was focused on a patch of grass three or four feet across. The grass seemed oddly shiny and dark at the same time, like oil had spilled on it.
Hamish crouched and swiped a finger carefully across a blade of grass. A long, sticky strand stretched between his hand and the grass as he stood back up, snapping only after it was a foot or more in length. Hamish made a face as he inspected his finger.
“Ugh, that’s gross. Feels like snot.”
“Disgusting, Hamish,” said Charlene, but his attention was still focused on his finger. He rubbed it against his thumb, then sniffed it.
“Is that blood?” he asked.
“Blood doesn’t stretch like that,” Silvio said.
“Yeah, but look at this.” He held his fingers out as we crowded around. Beneath the slimy coating, his thumb and forefinger shone red with what looked all the world like blood.
“But what would it be from?” Abram asked. We all shone our lights around, looking for the source of the blood and goo.
Silvio gasped. “Phil’s under the car! Phil, are you all right?”
He knelt. An instant later he screamed, falling over backwards and scrambling to get away.
“Silvio! Silvio, what is it?” Abram demanded, but I had already seen what he had seen. Phil’s hand was sticking out from under the car. But Phil was not under there. The hand ended halfway down the forearm in a ragged, bloody stump. The severed end glistened with a thick, gelatinous goo. The rest of Phil’s body was nowhere to be seen.
The next few minutes were chaotic. There was shouting, screaming and running. We all went for the house, which was good because it kept us together but we were definitely in each other’s way. I’ve never truly understood panic as I did in that moment. I knew what to do, knew that I should be calm, but that tiny detached part of me could only watch as I fled like a frightened animal.
I got myself back under control once I was inside and there was a wall between me and whatever had happened outside. I called the police and told them what we’d found. They assured me that the house was the safest place to be and recommended that we all stay together for safety until they got there. “Lock the doors,” they said, as if we hadn’t done that the instant that Abram’s heels had crossed the threshold.
“Okay, the police are coming,” I told everyone as I hung up. They’d obviously all been listening to my half of the conversation anyway, but I felt the need to say something. “They’ll be here soon.”
“How soon is soon?” asked Silvio, his voice rising. “Someone murdered Philip! They cut him up! And we never heard anything!”
Abram pulled Silvio close and held him as he shook. “It’ll be okay. We’ve just got to sit tight. We’ll be out of this soon.”
“Philip won’t!” Silvio sobbed. No one had any response to that. We all just listened to Silvio cry.
Hamish crossed to the fireplace and picked up a poker. He looked at us almost sheepishly. “Better than not being armed at all,” he said.
Charlene cast a doubtful eye over the remaining implements, an ash shovel and a brush. “I’ll just stand behind you, then.”
“Are the windows locked?” Christian asked. “How about the back door?”
“I think so,” Abram said. “They should be.”
“I’ll go check,” said Christian, and left the room. We heard him moving around, followed by a sudden shout of surprise.
“Christian!” I shouted, leaping to my feet, but he was already hurrying back into the room. His eyes were wide.
“This is nuts, but I swear I just saw Phil’s face at the window,” he said. “What if he’s not dead?”
“Someone tore his arm off,” Charlene pointed out.
“Yeah, but that’s survivable. Look, I don’t know. All I know is as I turned toward one of the windows, I saw a face staring in at me, and I swear it was his. I shouted, the face vanished, I came back in here.”
He paused. “I want to open the back door and see if he’s outside.”
“No way,” said Silvio. “No. No way.”
“He might be alive,” Christian insisted. “And if he is, he needs our help. I’m not stupid enough to open the door by myself and let some serial killer in to hack everyone up. I want you all to come with me. And if you’re all against it, then fine, we pretend I just imagined it and we never open the door. But I want to look. I don’t want to leave him out there.”
Silvio was already shaking his head again, but Abram spoke up first. “If there’s even a chance, we should look. We were fine when we were out front together. We can afford a quick look out the back door. And if we can still somehow save Phil, we have to try.”
“I’m not going,” said Silvio.
Christian nodded. “Stay here with him,” he said to Abram. “The four of us will go look. We’ll be right back, either with Phil or with the knowledge that we couldn’t have helped him.”
Hamish, Charlene, Christian and I made our way to the back door. We let Hamish lead since he had the only weapon, but once we entered the kitchen the rest of us armed ourselves with knives.
“Where did you see him?” I asked.
Christian indicated one of the windows. “He was right there. I was walking this way when—”
“Look!” Hamish cut him off, pointing the poker at a different window. I swung my head in that direction just in time to see a face disappearing into the darkness. It was poorly lit and I had only barely glimpsed it, but it might well have been Phil. There had been something wrong, though. He had seemed almost to glisten, like an oil slick. I thought about the dark slime on the grass and wondered how badly hurt he was.
“Is he okay? What’s he doing?” asked Charlene.
“I don’t know,” said Christian. “Back me up. I’m opening the door.”
We nervously took up defensive positions as Christian turned the handle. The door opened, letting in the cool night air. Outside was dark and quiet. Even the bugs seemed to have gone silent.
“Phil?” Christian called, taking a step onto the back stoop. “Phil, say something if you need help.”
He paused and we all listened, but heard nothing. Christian took another step outside, raising his cell phone light high. “Philip!”
“He’s not there,” Hamish said. “I don’t know what you saw, but—”
There was a sudden skittering of feet, and then the window smashed. Something huge, jagged and opalescent smashed its way through. It stood as tall as a small horse, with legs like a praying mantis and a shell like something from the deep ocean.  As it scrabbled frantically inside, two of those serrated legs dug deep into Hamish’s shoulders. Hamish shouted, swinging frantically with the poker, but he was inside its grip and couldn’t get a good hit.
“Help me!” he cried, but I was frozen by what I saw on the creature’s shell. It was lumpy and misshapen, the shiny surface raised into smooth protrusions that looked strikingly like various animals. In the middle of them all, staring at me from less than a foot away, was a human face. It was unmistakably Phil’s, sticking outward from the hard shell of the creature as if it had been shoved into a wet mold.
The creature hissed. A rank vapor rolled outward from it, stinking of rot and stinging the eyes. I fell back, coughing, and as I did so the mouth on its belly irised open. Its entire underside was one tremendous mouth, ringed with row upon row of slicing, sharp-edged teeth. It contracted its forelimbs, dragging Hamish closer, and he screamed again.
Then Christian was there, grabbing the poker away from Hamish and smashing blow upon punishing blow down onto the creature’s shell. The thick surface resisted the first two hits, but on the third strike a ragged crack appeared. The creature hissed again, filling the room with that horrible stench, but Christian continued to pummel it.
Charlene, emboldened by his success, began to stab at it with her knife. Her slashes skidded off the shell, so she switched to striking at it from underneath, stabbing it in the soft grey tissue of its mouth.
I struck it one good blow in the mouth with my knife, but it jerked as I hit it and pulled the knife away from me. I nearly tried to grab it back, but the gnashing teeth dissuaded me. Instead, I seized the nearest limb and wrenched it upward, off of Hamish’s shoulder. I could feel spines tearing into my palms, but I ignored the pain and shoved as hard as I could until I saw Hamish twist free.
Unwilling to lose its meal, the monster lunged forward, dragging its entire bulk into the house. It knocked me over, pinning my leg beneath it. The wet slime engulfed my shin. The teeth began to dig in. I felt myself being drawn under.
Before I could be dragged beneath it, Christian stabbed downward using the poker as a spear. The shell, now spiderwebbed with cracks from the repeated blows, shattered beneath this final assault. Whatever the poker struck beneath the protective carapace must have been vital, for the creature collapsed almost at once.
I tried to pull my leg free, but the teeth threatened to flay my skin and instead I called for help.
“Get this thing off of me!”
It was Abram and Silvio who rushed to my aid. To the aid of all of us, really. We were all bleeding, coughing and panting from exertion. The encounter had taken less than half a minute, yet I felt as if I’d finished a triathlon. Abram and Silvio had barely had time to get to the kitchen doorway before it was all over.
They lifted the monster’s body, allowing me to slide free. They brought towels, bandages and antiseptic. They wrapped my hands, Hamish’s shoulder and a dozen miscellaneous injuries that Charlene and Christian had suffered. They were simple, important tasks. They gave us something to focus on. They kept us from having to think about what had happened.
Eventually, though, everything was cleaned and bandaged, and a dead monster still lay at our feet. Ichor dripped from its wounds, mixing with our blood and its horrible thick saliva to make a spreading puddle on the kitchen tiles. And the face of our dead friend still stared sightlessly up from the creature’s side.
“What is it?” Abram finally asked. It’s not like he thought any of us would have the answer, but someone had to say something. “How could…where did…what is it?”
“What do you think this means?” Charlene asked, gingerly touching the image of Philip’s face.
“Exactly what we already knew,” Hamish said grimly. “Philip’s gone.”
“You don’t think maybe—” Charlene started, but Hamish cut her off.
“No. Look at all the rest of these. Squirrels, cats, that one looks like maybe a fox—these are what it’s been eating. It kills them, and then somehow presses their face into its shell. Look, the smaller ones are less distinct. It’s been growing as it eats, working its way up to bigger and bigger things. The impressions of the small animals have been stretched out as the shell grows. The bigger ones, the ones it’s only been able to get recently, they’re perfectly clear. And Philip….”
He trailed off, not needing to finish. Philip’s face was as clear as if it had been sculpted. He was gone, like everything else depicted on the creature’s shell.
“But why?” Silvio asked. “What does it get out of taking impressions of the things it eats?”
“Mating ritual, maybe?” I suggested. “Animals have all sorts of weird ways to attract mates. This would show how proficient of a hunter it was, so that—”
I stopped abruptly. Christian’s face, normally ruddy and animated, had gone slack and turned a sickly pale green. “No, no,” he muttered. “Mates. Of course.”
“What?” I asked.
He looked around at the shattered window, at the wide-open room. “Everyone, quick. We need to get to a safer space.”
“But it’s dead—” Abram started.
“Now!” barked Christian. Abram jumped, alarmed.
“Is the living room good enough?”
“Somewhere without windows would be best. Somewhere we can all fit.”
Silvio was shaking his head. “It’s an open plan. There’s nothing like that.”
“Anywhere where we can turn the lights off and hide, then!” insisted Christian.
“What’s going on?” I asked plaintively.
“I told you I found something on the way here. Come back to the living room, I’ll show you.”
We all followed him in a tight herd. Christian retrieved the bag that had contained the wine and reached inside. He pulled out a smooth, gleaming white pearl bigger than my fist. Oily rainbows flickered across its surface as he held it up for our inspection.
“Is that a pearl?” asked Silvio.
“I thought it was. Not a real one, obviously, but something manufactured, maybe. I found a cluster of them on the side of the road on the way here, nestled up against the trunk of a tree. I thought maybe they’d fallen off of a truck. There certainly wasn’t anyone else around to claim them, so I took them.
“But we know now, don’t we? They’re not pearls.” Christian walked over to the fireplace and set the pearl down on the bricks. Kneeling next to it, he raised the poker over his head and swung it downward, impacting the smooth sphere with a resounding crack.
The pearl smashed open. A thick grey liquid oozed out into the fireplace. Among the brittle shards, something moved. It was about the size of my cupped palm, with jagged legs and a smooth, shimmering shell still unmarked by any protrusions. It was the creature we had fought, wrought in miniature.
Christian crushed it brutally with the poker. He grabbed his bag and upended it, dumping out five more spheres. Again and again he brought the poker down, shattering the shells and destroying the tiny creatures within.
“Mates,” he said in between blows. “There’s no such thing as one of something. Nothing’s unique. Everything that lives, breeds. We didn’t find the only one. We just found the first.”
“But you found its nest,” I offered.
“I found a nest. What are the odds these are the only six eggs? And if these were laid in a clutch, the one that we killed, the full-grown one, probably had siblings, too.”
He stood, his murderous work done. “Assuming that one was even full-grown.”
Just then, blue strobing lights washed through the room. Through the front window, we could see a police car outside.
“We need to get them in here,” Christian said, striding to the front door. “They have no idea of the danger they’re walk—”
As he opened the door, a creature took him in the left shoulder with a hooked forelimb. It spun him around and dragged him out backwards, dropping its bulk across his torso and driving him to the porch with a sickening snap. Christian’s legs kicked twice and went still.
I heard the confused shouts of the police, followed rapidly by gunshots. The creature on the porch jerked from repeated impacts before collapsing over what was left of Christian’s body. Even as its life drained away, I could see the shell slowly rising, molding itself into the beginnings of a head-sized lump.
There was a scream from outside. It was followed by more gunshots, then another scream, this one more intelligible.
“Get it off! Get it—”
Then there was nothing.
I would like to say that I made a considered plan, that I decided that the creatures outside were probably occupied and it would be safe to make a run for it. I would like to say that I urged my friends to join me.
The truth of the matter is that something snapped in my mind, and I ran. I had seen too much that night, and all I wanted was to be somewhere where I never had to see anything like it again. Hamish and Charlene ran with me, I know. I know this because I heard Charlene screaming Hamish’s name, and Hamish simply screaming, as something massive dragged him off into the night.
I do not know if Charlene made it to her car. I don’t know if Abram and Silvio were safe in their house. All I know is that I got to my car and floored it out of there, spitting chunks of dirt from the yard as the tires dug for traction. I hit the road and never looked back. I didn’t stop until I was all the way back home, at which point I collapsed against my steering wheel and wept.
I called, of course, once I was myself again. I tried all of their phones. I don’t know what I would have said if they had answered, but it doesn’t much matter, as none of them picked up.
Abram, Silvio, Charlene—I know where they are. They’re all out there somewhere in the woods, their faces pressed horribly against the inside of an opalescent shell."	9.0	14.0	Micah Edwards	01/28/2021
Grey Michael	"It started out like any other work day. I had houses to sell and people who wanted to buy them. Honestly, I’ve always found being a realtor embarrassingly easy. People seek you out and ask you to sell them incredibly high-ticket items. I’ve done other sales jobs, and you always have to talk the buyers into extras, into upgrades, all for a tiny commission.
With houses, it’s so much easier. Your customers walk in already prepared to sign their life away for the next thirty years, so it’s easy to convince them to go for the nicer house, the better neighborhood, the higher price tag. The bigger commission, from my point of view.
Obviously, it’s not always completely smooth. I’ve had some real nightmare clients. Who hasn’t? I’ve been yelled at, talked down to, insulted, even physically threatened on a couple of occasions. But 90% of my job was just about keeping a smile on my face and saying empty phrases like “Okay, I hear you” or “Let’s keep looking!” Easy as pie.
So I didn’t expect this day to be anything out of the ordinary. Houses had been selling well lately and I’d just gotten several new ones added to my roster. If I kept my numbers up, I was on track to have the most sales of the quarter, so I was pretty motivated to get out there and get folks into a new house.
I usually like to go do a walkthrough beforehand to make sure that there aren’t any surprises, but I hadn’t had a chance to do that with my upcoming afternoon showing. If I had, maybe it would have turned out a lot better for the Hubers. Then again, maybe it would have turned out a lot worse for me, so…I don’t know.
The house looked fine from the outside. It was a California split-level, a little under two thousand square feet, a classy mix of brick and wood siding. The house and land were well-maintained, and I could see that Mrs. Huber, Marilyn, was already charmed by it. It was within their price range, in the school district they were looking for, and basically everything was just falling into place.
I could smell an easy sale. I was going to be able to knock this one off on day one, and then it’d just be a matter of paperwork. I refrained from rubbing my hands together in glee as I walked the Hubers up to the front door, but only barely. That’s how good I was feeling about this.
Inside was great, too, at least at first. Hardwood floors in the entry hall, big windows letting the whole place glow in the afternoon sun, nice neutral colors on the walls and a pleasant smell in the air. It was picture-perfect staging, and the Hubers were eating it up. Irving was pointing out fancy features in the kitchen, Marilyn was talking about having people over for parties, and I just followed along pretending they needed me there. I didn’t have to do a thing. The house was selling itself.
Everything went perfectly right up until we were leaving. We’d finished touring the top floor and they’d both gushed about how perfect the view from the master bedroom was. I was leading the way down the stairs, chatting over my shoulder with the Hubers and keeping one hand on the railing to guide myself along. I wasn’t really paying much attention. How much attention does anyone ever pay to stairs? These were carpeted, they didn’t squeak and the wooden posts and railings were solid and attractive. They successfully connected the floors of the house. That’s all you can really say about stairs.
Suddenly, Marilyn broke in to my patter. “Sorry, this is a strange question, but…how many floors does this house have?”
“Three including the finished basement,” I told her, wondering why she was asking. We’d just finished walking through them all.
“Right, that’s what I thought. Only…this is the second flight of stairs. And we’re still heading to the front hallway.”
I honestly had no idea what she meant at first. Obviously, it wasn’t the second flight of stairs, or we would be on our way to the basement. These weren’t the basement stairs. Therefore, we hadn’t gone down two flights.
I tried to think of a way to say “you have not successfully counted to one” that didn’t sound patronizing or rude. Finding nothing, instead I said, “Well, we’re here now, at least. We can—”
I stopped dead on a small landing where the stairs made a right turn. It should have been just a couple more stairs to the entryway. Instead, I was looking at the hallway leading to the bedrooms. The one on the top floor of the house.
I looked behind me. At the top of the stairs I could see the hallway we’d just left. My mind lurched, trying to find some sense to seize onto. It was a three-level house. I was at the base of some stairs. I could see other stairs ahead of me, leading down. Therefore, I must be on the middle level, where the entryway was. It’s just that I wasn’t. I was on the top level. Having taken stairs down to get there.
“Something’s wrong,” I said stupidly. Irving and Marilyn reached out and held each other’s hands. They looked around nervously. I realized that they were waiting for me to do something. I was in charge here, after all.
“Let’s just…let’s just take the stairs down,” I suggested, suiting action to word. This time, I kept my eyes focused ahead, watching every step. I could hear the Hubers walking along behind me, their paired treads only a stair away. Ordinarily, I would have been annoyed to have a client stepping on my heels like that, but right now I didn’t blame them at all.
Eleven stairs down brought us to a right-turn landing. With trepidation, I made the turn, hoping that somehow I’d just misunderstood something before, that I’d somehow failed to use stairs correctly. My hopes were dashed as I stepped out into the same carpeted hallway leading to the bedrooms. The ground floor was still somehow below us.
The Hubers exchanged wide-eyed glances.
“I don’t understand this,” said Marilyn.
“Well, look,” said Irving, trying to be reasonable. “If ‘down’ doesn’t work, maybe ‘up’ will?”
He turned and began to walk back up the stairs. Struck by a sudden curiosity, I moved across the hall to look at the stairs leading down. Marilyn kept her position on the landing so she could see both of us.
When the stairs came into view, I saw exactly what I’d feared. Although Irving had gone up the stairs behind me, I was now ahead of him on the floor he was climbing to.
His face blanched when he saw me. “This—this is impossible.”
He looked back at Marilyn below him. “How is this happening?”
“I can see you,” Marilyn called weakly to me. “From both directions. I can see you at the top of the stairs—” She pointed. “—and at the bottom over here.”
She turned her head and gestured. Suddenly feeling weak, I sat down against the wall, taking solace in its solidity. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, willing this all to be some sort of fever dream.
“Are you all right?” Irving called. I heard his footsteps start toward me. He was only four or five steps from the top. Somehow, though, they kept going.
I opened my eyes. Irving was climbing the stairs, a look of terror on his face. He scrambled faster and faster, yet he never moved forward. Marilyn screamed. I leapt to my feet. Behind Irving, the staircase was lengthening, adding a stair beneath his feet for every step he took.
I lunged forward, my hand extended for him to grab, but as I reached for him a dozen new stairs appeared, dragging him away from me.
“Go back down!” I shouted. Irving turned and tried to run, but it was too late. The stairs stretched away at a frightening rate, a corridor reaching out to infinity. Irving was reduced to a tiny speck somewhere in the middle, and although I could hear Marilyn screaming right behind me, I could also hear a tiny version echoing faintly up the walls of what had been the staircase in front of me.
Less than a second later, the staircase snapped back into place, the same eleven steps there should always have been. Irving was gone.
Marilyn was shrieking. She had collapsed onto the landing and was clinging to the railing like it was a lifeline. She sobbed Irving’s name over and over, but there was no response.
Her total breakdown helped bring me back to myself. I took her by the arm and attempted to tug her to her feet.
“Mrs. Huber. Marilyn. Come on, please. We have to get out of here.”
“How?” she wailed, a question for which I have no answer.
“I don’t know. One of the rooms, maybe? There must be—” I opened the door to one of the bedrooms. Fear gripped my stomach. The door now led to another set of stairs. Or, more probably, the same ones.
“Irving. Irving!”
“Come on! That isn’t helping. Let’s…I don’t know, let’s try going down the stairs with our eyes closed. Maybe it’s an illusion.” That didn’t make any sense, but it was all I could come up with.
It was good enough for Marilyn, at least. She closed her eyes and, still clinging to my hand, allowed me to lead her to the stairs.
“Okay, here’s the rail. Put your hand on it. I’m not going to let go of you,” I assured her. “Just hold the rail for safety. I’m going to have my eyes closed, too. Ready? Stay close. Here we go.”
My right hand on the railing, my left hand bent awkwardly behind me, I shuffled forward and felt my way onto the first step. I stepped down and felt Marilyn move into position behind me.
Step, step. Down the stairs, one shuffling movement at a time. I kept my eyes squeezed shut, letting my feet guide me. Slow though I went, though, after a few steps Marilyn began to fall behind.
“Come on, you’ve got to keep up.”
“I’m trying! You’re going too fast.”
I’m barely moving, I thought, but did not say. I bit my tongue and took another step. From behind me, I heard Marilyn’s muffled footsteps hitting the carpeted stairs. Once, twice. Three times. My left hand, still gripped tightly in her fist, began to get pulled slowly backward.
“Marilyn?”
“Slow down,” she begged me. “You’re getting too far ahead. Stop moving!”
Fully stationary, I risked opening my eyes. I saw what I already knew had to be true: just as it had with Irving, the staircase was beginning to lengthen.
“Marilyn,” I said, my voice catching in my throat. Her eyes popped open, widening in fear as she realized what was happening.
“Help me!”
Her palm started to slide through my grasp, and I did the only thing I could do. I pulled as hard as I could, yanking her off of the stairs and sending her tumbling onto me.
We fell down the last four stairs together, crashing into the wall of the landing hard enough to crack the plaster. I saw stars and tasted blood. Shaking my head, I struggled to a standing position and found that I was now looking at the entryway, its gleaming wooden floors a shining beacon of hope.
Marilyn was still sobbing on the ground, her arms wrapped around my leg. I’d like to believe that I wouldn’t have bolted for the door and left her there in any case, but I certainly wasn’t going to with the death grip she had on me.
“Marilyn. Marilyn, we made it. We’re here. We can get out.”
She looked up, fearful and disbelieving.
“Come on,” I coaxed, lifting her to her feet once more. “Look, there’s the door. We can go.”
“But Irving—!”
“I know. I know. We’ll come back for him,” I lied. There was no chance I was ever setting foot in that house again. “We can get help. We’ve just got to go.”
I half-dragged her to the door. I was certain that it was going to be another trick, that the hallway would begin to stretch or the outside door would open to more stairs, but I had no idea what else to do. When I opened the front door and it actually led to the outside, I burst into tears.
Eyes streaming, I raced down the brick steps. Marilyn kept pace with me, both of us running as fast as we could until we collapsed against our cars, chests heaving. Her hair was wild, her knees were skinned, her blouse was torn. I was certain I looked no better. I could feel a painful wetness on the back of my head where I’d banged it into the wall, but my hair seemed to be keeping most of the blood in place. And if that was what it took to get out of that nightmare, I counted it a small price to pay.
We stared at each other for several minutes. My heart rate gradually slowed. My mind attempted to tell me that I couldn’t have seen what I thought I had. It was a bright, sunny, suburban day. Houses didn’t unfold into impossible geometries. Not in a nice neighborhood like this.
If Irving had been there with us, I might have even convinced myself it was some sort of hallucination. But he wasn’t. The house had him.
“We have to go back in,” Marilyn said, but her voice lacked conviction.
I shook my head, eliciting a stab of pain. “No way. Sorry, no way.”
“But Irving’s in there!”
“We’ll get him. We’ll get help. We can—I don’t know, tie a rope to the outside. Or make a human chain or something. Something. But we can’t go back in there like this.”
“I can’t just leave him!”
“We’ll come—” My response was interrupted by a loud slam! from the house. Our heads both jerked up to see the front door standing wide open. Irving stood in the doorframe, gripping the edges like his life depended on it. He gave a cry that was half a yell of triumph and half a sob, and then he fell bonelessly down the brick steps to the pathway below.
Marilyn and I raced over. Irving was in bad shape, and not just from the fall. His clothes were tattered and filthy. His hands were bloody and blistered. His hair was ragged, and although he had been clean-shaven when we stepped into the house, he now had what appeared to be several days’ growth of beard.
“Irving! Irv? Irv!” Marilyn cradled his head in her arms, but Irving did not move. I checked his pulse and was relieved to find it present. I let Marilyn attempt to wake him up for another minute, and then I took out my cell and called 911.
I lied to the dispatchers. I said he’d had some sort of an attack, that I thought maybe it was blood sugar related. I said his wife was here and would hopefully be calmed down enough when they arrived to give them better information. I gave them the address and told them we would meet them at the street. They said not to move him, and I told them that that was where he had collapsed. Then I hung up the phone so I could drag him to the curb. The open door of the house gaped mockingly behind me, challenging me to come back inside. It scared me to look into it, but it scared me more to have my back to it, so I simply got as far away as I could and waited for the EMTs.
The ambulance took the Hubers away, leaving me alone. With no idea what else to do, I got into my car and drove back to the office. It wasn’t even really a conscious decision. I was in shock and running on autopilot.
I wandered into the office looking like I’d been mugged in the parking lot. I stumbled to my desk, ignoring my coworkers’ questions, and fell into my chair. I stared at my reflection in the blank monitor as their chatter passed over my head.
After a few minutes, a hand fell onto my shoulder. I looked up to see my coworker Maryann.
“What happened?”
“He just—I just—he, um. There was an attack. He had an attack, I mean.”
Keeping her voice low, her eyes darting around to see who was listening, she asked, “Was it a house?”
“What?”
“A house. Did something go…wrong…in the house?”
I stared at her dumbly. She pressed on.
“Monsters. Bent space. Distortions of reality?”
I nodded.
“Okay. Here.”
She passed me a business card, one from our agency. The name on it was GREY MICHAEL. It wasn’t anyone I knew.
“Gre—” I started. Maryann frantically shushed me.
“Do not say his name until you’re ready to talk to him! Go get cleaned up first. Take a moment. Don’t stumble into this.”
“Who is this?”
She glanced furtively around again. “He’s…a coworker. He specializes in…difficult houses. He can help you here.”
I looked around the office. It wasn’t that large of a space. “Okay, but…who is he?”
“When you’re ready, go out into the hallway. His office is right there.”
“I’ve never seen it.”
“You will once you say his name.”
Maryann moved off into the office, spreading a cover story about a client fainting and dragging me with him down some steps. I turned the card over in my hands a few times, then tucked it into my pocket and went to wash up.
I wasn’t wholly successful at getting all of the blood out of my hair, but by the time I was done I looked fairly presentable and felt a whole lot more awake. My brain was working overtime trying to convince me that I’d imagined the whole thing, that I’d fallen and hit my head and made the rest of it up. But there was still a 911 call in my “recent calls” log and I knew that if I called the local hospitals, I’d be able to find out where the Hubers had been admitted pretty easily.
I planted my hands on the bathroom counter and stared at myself in the mirror, trying to decide if I was looking into the eyes of a crazy person. In the end, I shrugged and turned away without an answer.
“All right,” I said to myself. “Let’s go find Grey Michael.”
His office, as Maryann had said, was right there. The name was on a plaque on the door. It was impossible to miss, yet I’d somehow walked past it every day. I knocked lightly on the door.
“Come in,” called a mild voice. I opened the door and met Grey Michael.
He was normal. Aggressively normal. If I told you to picture a generic white male, you’d be thinking of him. His smile was pleasant and professional, a perfect stock-image look. He gestured to a chair in front of his desk.
“Come in. Close the door, have a seat. So you have a problem?”
I followed his instructions. “How do you know I have a problem?”
“You have my card,” he said, as if that explained everything. “Tell me what happened.”
I started to speak, but he quickly held up one thin finger. “Not what you think happened. Not what must have happened because what you remember can’t possibly be true. Tell me what happened, in order, without apology or prevarication.”
Something in his voice made his words less of an instruction and more of an unassailable command. I opened my mouth and let the words fall out.
When I had finished, Grey Michael nodded his head. “Simple enough.”
“Simple?”
“Yes. This is small, a fledgling. One trick, very little power. Shall we go?”
“Go where?” I was totally lost in this conversation.
“To the house. To remove it.”
I started to refuse, but Grey Michael stood up from his desk and brushed invisible dust from his suit. “Drive. It will give you something to do.”
Without thinking, my keys were in my hand and I was heading for the door. We were out of the parking lot before I even realized he was riding in my passenger seat.
“I can’t go back in there,” I told him.
“You won’t have to. Only one step, so that you can declare your request for assistance.”
“What?”
“You need to say the following phrase, as exactly as you can: I, as the duly appointed representative tasked with the preservation of this home and its contents, hereby invite Grey Michael inside.” Only he didn’t say “Grey Michael.” His lips said “Grey Michael.” The sound said “Grey Michael.” But what I felt was something dark and broken, words of tortured malice.
We passed the rest of the drive in silence. Grey Michael seemed content to watch the scenery, while I was simply trying to calm my panicked brain.
When we pulled up outside, the front door was closed.
“I left that open,” I told Grey Michael.
“It’s not important,” he said, getting out of the car. “This will all be over soon.”
My courage failed me as I approached the front door. If it had still been open, I think I could have stepped inside. But to grasp the handle and open it myself was beyond me.
“I can’t. I can’t do this.”
“Hm,” said Grey Michael. “Are you saying that you’ve wasted my time?”
I took an immediate step backward from the look he gave me, banging my back against the house’s front door. “No! No.”
“Then open the door and invite me inside.”
I opened it without hesitation. My fear of the house hadn’t lessened, but I’d found something I feared more. I took a single step inside.
“That’s far enough,” said Grey Michael. “Now. Invite me.”
I cleared my throat. “I, as the duly appointed representative tasked with the preservation of this home and its contents, hereby invite Grey Michael inside.”
His name twisted like burned rope in my throat. It felt like nails on bone, carving secret messages on my skeleton, words that would never leave me.
“Thank you,” he said, stepping past me into the house. “Now. Please remain on the porch and hold this door closed. Do not open it for anything. It could be very dangerous for you if you do.”
He closed the door in my face. I took hold of the handle and exerted a gentle pull. I wondered how long I was going to have to stand like this, and what I would say to anyone who asked what I was doing.
Those thoughts were driven from my mind when the screaming started. I jumped, nearly losing my grip on the door handle, but fear of Grey Michael kept me in place.
The screams seemed to come from the house itself, as if the bricks and boards were crying out. They ranged up and down in pitch, sounding sometimes human but always terrified.
Then the scratching started, desperate clawing against the door. I felt tugging against the handle and I leaned my weight back, heedless of the steps behind me. Not for anything, Grey Michael had said, and I would not open it for anything.
My blood ran cold as voices began pleading with me. Children, old folks, family members. They begged and cried to get out. I stood fast. They slowly died away.
“Thank you,” said Grey Michael from behind me. I spun around to find him standing at the bottom of the steps, not a hair out of place. “You can release the door now. The house has been cleansed.”
“What do we do now?”
“By preference, you take me back to the office. You have a house to sell, after all. And I have other work to do.”
We were silent again on the drive back. At one point, he yawned. I glanced over and caught a glimpse into his mouth. It opened up like a cave. Distant lights glittered inside.
He saw me watching and raised an eyebrow. I said nothing.
We shook hands back at the office. “I’ll be seeing you around,” Grey Michael said. I’ve been trying not to think too hard about what that might mean.
In the meantime…anyone looking to buy a house? I can guarantee with absolute certainty that it is not haunted. Grey Michael made sure of that.

Fey Hollow	"I was but a boy when I first discovered the grove in the wood, or, perhaps, when it discovered me. I came across the path leading to it down from my grandparents’ house where I would often visit in the summer months, wild and free from the responsibilities of school. At perhaps ten years of age, while whiling the days away in the simple pleasures of fresh air and sunshine, I stumbled upon the strange dirt path running through the forest, somehow sinister and inviting all at once. I recall the particular feeling of dreadful excitement I first had when I found the tree-lined trail, unpaved but well-worn by the passage of many small feet over a very long time. It curled and swayed this way and that, not appearing to obey any logic or whim, the twists and turns of its passage taking it through swaths of deep shadow, over fallen trees and across babbling brooks. I had to follow it, of course, even though I knew that there was something darkly magical about the road I trod. I had played in the woods many times before and, though I was not the best natural pathfinder, I knew this trail had, somehow, never before lay where it now did. Still, a puzzle so mysterious at this, my natural boyish curiosity was simply too powerful for my inherent caution to overcome.
I don’t know how long I followed the path. Time and reality seemed to enter into a kind of waking dream as I traveled along, and as I continued, the sun gave way to sparkling moonlight visible through the leaf-lined branches of the trees spreading wide above, stars foreign and unknown to me twinkling brightly with strange eldritch light. Despite the oddity of my journey and the expectant terror that should have beset me from being alone in a place that I was wholly unfamiliar with, all that I felt was a sense of calm and belonging. The barest tinkling silver scraps of music reached my ears as I walked, so faint that they could almost be taken as my imagination, but the strains were so cheerful and inviting that any possible thoughts of discontinuing my journey were rapidly driven from my mind.
The farther I got along the path, the closer I got to the music, the quicker my steps became, my feet slapping against the dirt in time with the rapidly increasing beat of my heart as it thundered within my chest. I was forced to pause for a moment when, from the corner of my eye, I spotted a strange glint of moonlight sharply reflecting from inside a hollowed-out portion of a tree just off the path. I faltered, unable to decide between continuing on towards the bewitching music and investigating this newly-discovered phenomenon, before ultimately choosing to pursue the latter. Surely the music would wait for me just a moment.
Reaching into the tree, my fingers felt the cold smoothness of carved metal. I retrieved the object from within and found it was a sort of pendant strung upon a leather thong and inlaid in silver, its center stone encircled by an alien but beautiful script that was unknown to me. Most strangely, the gem itself softly glowed seemingly by means of its own power. As I studied my newfound treasure, I was shocked to discover that my feet, apparently of their own accord, had continued to guide me along the path, again traveling towards the haunting music that still beckoned me onward. Regaining conscious control of my passage, slightly shaken by my auto-ambulation despite the reassuring lilt of the music, I slipped the pendant into my pocket and cautiously proceeded, exhilarant and nervous to discover what might lie at the end of the forest path.
At last, the way passed through a high wooden archway before opening into a large clearing perhaps one hundred yards in diameter that, to my wonder, appeared to be occupied by a fantastic carnival. I continued walking, proceeding down the midway running through the center of the grove lined on either side by colorful booths decorated with garish paints and sparkling lights that offered games of chance and all manner of delightful confections.  Dozens of other children ran about me, alone and in packs of two, three, or more, all squealing in glee. Each of the individual booths was appealing in its own right. The gaming stands offered great variety from ring tosses to whack-a-mole, and each bore the promise of enormous stuffed animals as prizes, their features so well-crafted as to seem wholly lifelike. The food stands advertised the most sumptuous of treats, apples fairly dripping with caramel, blue and pink cotton candy handed out in huge clouds atop paper cones, and foot-long hot dogs piled high with molten cheese and chili. Each of the offerings seemed so incredibly perfect that the thought of choosing one over the other proved overwhelming, so instead, I simply continued to walk along and marvel again at each newly revealed sight. The music that had drawn me along the path continued here unabated, saturating the air but somehow simultaneously coming from nowhere.
Reaching the center of the clearing, I found that the midway reached a sort of hub, with two other paths combining to create a ‘Y’ dividing the fairgrounds into three roughly equal parts. Each of the paths was lined with booths similar to the one I had already traversed, and on further inspection, each section of the fairgrounds played host to a different attraction. In one was a roller coaster, its first hill taller than the surrounding trees, the train roaring at terrific speeds along the track as the riders screeched in delight. In another rose a great Ferris wheel, lights flickering in sequence along its many arms. And in the final third, directly ahead and serving as a focal point and apex to the entire park, stood an enormous, haunted house attraction, its exterior covered with animatronic ghosts and ghouls.
The center hub where I was now standing was occupied by two distinct features, an enormous fountain topped by a statue of three children at play, and a ticket booth. I looked at the fountain. Streams of water poured from the statue children’s mouths, their lips split into grins so wide that it made me feel slightly uncomfortable. Hundreds of coins lay in the bottom of the fountain, glistening in the moonlight pouring down from above. Looking up, I saw the pale full moon shone brightly, the upper expanse of sky now devoid of tree branches.  I felt for sure that the moon was the closest I had ever seen it, fully two or three times larger than it had ever been before. The shock I felt when the imposed face typically called “the man in the moon” turned and gave me a fully realized wink and grin was only slightly greater than when I realized the celestial body possessed far more feminine features than I could have ever before imagined.
“Beautiful, isn’t she? Don’t you agree with me?”
I jumped in surprise as a piping voice spoke from directly behind me. Turning I found myself confronted with a strange creature, perhaps two feet in height. The being was dressed all in green, from its pants and coat to the little hat on its head, and its ears were tapered to points at their ends. All told, it resembled nothing so much as a classic elf from the fairy tales my grandparents would read to me before I fell asleep every night.
“Yes, she certainly is,” I replied politely, taught through rout practice and the switch that one should always behave properly when confronted with new acquaintances. “I’m Trevor. Please, sir, could you tell me where I am?” I reached down, offering my hand to shake.
The creature giggled but did not move to take my hand.
“Oh, so polite, calling Binkle ‘sir’. But that’s not necessary, no, my word. Why is master Trevor not having his fun, as that, in Fey Hollow, is what all children have done?”
“Fey Hollow? Is that the name of this place?”
The strangely speaking thing called Binkle nodded animatedly.
“Yes, yes, Fey Hollow is where all the children come for fun, and when it’s done, they’re off to run. Now get your tickets, Master Trevor, so you can have fun too. Hurry now, before the night is through!”
The diminutive creature turned and skipped off down the path to the left. I stood, bemused, unsure of how to proceed. I turned my attention to the ticket booth, its exterior striped with inviting bands of red and white, the window manned by another being that could have been Binkle’s twin. I approached the counter and began to rummage in my pockets.
“I’d like some tickets, please, sir. I’m afraid, as I hadn’t been intending on coming to your fair, I don’t have much money on me.”
“Oh, never fear, Master Trevor, dear. Tickets here for children are free. Have as many as you please.” The little being held out a handful of red and purple pull tickets towards me. With my left hand I reached to take the offered slips, but in the moment before my finger would have touched them, my other hand, still in my pocket, brushed the amulet I had discovered in the hollow tree along the path just minutes ago. With that contact, I received the biggest shock of the evening thus far, as a sort of wave shimmered across the entire tableau of the fairgrounds and a fog seemed to dissipate before my eyes.
I flinched, a knot of dread instantaneously forming itself in the center of my gut. The red and white striped ticket stand was gone, instead replaced by a blocky, eight-foot-tall creature like living stone. The “window” as I had seen it was now revealed to be the cavernous mouth of the creature, its upper and lower ridges lined with large sharp-looking teeth encrusted with flakes of dark reddish-brown. A slimily, dripping tongue tipped with tiny yellow spines exuding an oozing green mucus extended, occupying the very space wherein the elf had been offering my tickets. The fountain behind it was still there, but the smiling children upon it I had seen as statues were instead corpses, the liquid springing from their mouths not clear water but the red scarlet of fresh blood. The silvery music that had drawn me to the grove was also still present, but instead of a whimsical, inviting tune, it was a screeching cacophony sounding nothing so much as fingernails scratched along a chalkboard. Stumbling back, the hand in my pocket lost contact with the pendant, and instantly the booth, fountain, and music illusions snapped back into place, the elf in the window smiling saccharine sweet as it reached towards me, arm still extended.  I fumbled to try to make words in my mouth, but my tongue felt swollen and unwieldy behind my lips.
At last, I managed to gasp out, “I, uh, think I’ll look around a bit more before I get my tickets, ah, sir. I don’t want to, um…rush into things.” With an incredible effort of will, I turned back the way I came, terrified that the thing might simply decide to reach out and snatch me with that horrific prehensile appendage and pull me bodily into its disgusting maw, but not wanting it to see the tears that had sprung to my eyes and begun to slide down my cheeks. As slowly, and with as much control as I was able, I retraced my path down the midway in the direction I had entered, moving one shaky step after another back towards the entrance to the fairgrounds. A terrible thought crossed my mind and, after a moment’s deliberation, I hesitatingly gripped the amulet in my pocket once more. Again, the illusion fell away, and to my growing panic I realized that it was not merely the ticket booth that hid a darker and more horrific countenance, but rather the entire landscape and its occupants that were camouflaged behind a glamour of childish beauty.
The midway booths alone were enough to give me nightmares for the rest of my life. My cleared perception now saw them as they were, still games and eateries, to be sure, but nothing as innocently joyous as what I had first witnessed. The dart toss had a boy pinned to the wall, each projectile impacting with a sickening thud and a scream of pain from the tortured target. Similarly, at the whack-a-mole station, giggling children wielding sledgehammers pounded away at bloodied and broken heads that rose and fell, so disfigured as to be almost unrecognizable.
The stands offering refreshments were just as awful. The candy apples were, in reality, human hands and feet impaled on sticks, and my stomach lurched in disgust as two younger children walked by me, unwittingly devouring their ungodly treats, blood smearing their lips and dribbling down their chins. The various fair patrons were not merely the unknowing perpetrators of the horrors, however, but far to the contrary. The cotton candy appeared to actually be some sort of amorphous jelly that, once taken in hand by its unknowing victims, slowly and inevitably crawled up their arms, surrounded their heads, and began to eat. I saw perhaps twenty children, their heads engulfed by the insatiable blobs, wandering aimlessly, their skin and in some cases parts of their skulls simply dissolved away.  The hotdogs were strange, wriggling worms that slipped themselves into the children’s mouths and, with a sickening convulsing motion, proceeded to force their way down their throats. Several bodies lying about, large open wounds still bleeding from their exploded stomachs, told me what happened next. And these were not the worst. No, that distinction belonged to the three main attractions.
The general contour of the roller coaster remained the same, but now with the illusion lifted it became obvious that it was in fact a large serpentine beast, its snakelike body rising and curling about in the same path that the train had appeared to take. Its massive head lay at the “entrance”, and I watched as a line of waiting riders walked willingly into its open mouth. They appeared to be chatting excitedly until, with the tenth individual passing into that horrifying void, the maw clashed shut. After a couple of long moments, ten twitching lumps quieted, then began to pass through the creature like a constrictor digesting its prey. The jaws opened again, and the next ten passed inside.
My petrified attention turned to the Ferris wheel, which had been revealed by the amulet as a massive spider web stretched among the trees. Again, docilely waiting children stood and waited their turn as, one by one, they were scooped up by giant arachnids the size of ponies, rapidly enveloped in webbing, and hung upside down upon the many spokes of the silken construct. At the center of the web rested a massive spider, easily ten times as large as the others. Periodically the smaller creatures would retrieve one of the thrashing capsules and deposit it in front of what must be the queen, her front legs quickly positioning the captive. A quick flash of fangs the size of railroad spikes would pierce the prey, the paralyzing venom holding it still for her to subsequently devour the, hopefully unknowing, victim.
The haunted house was, perhaps, the most horrific of all. A stage was set before the structure which I now saw was built entirely of human bones of all shapes and sizes. Upon the stage sat a throne similarly constructed and upon it rested a creature of sylvan and utterly inhuman nature. Though the creature was unquestionably male based on the enormous, flaccid member lying between its legs, its features were distinctly feminine. Curled ram horns sprouted from either side of its head, its softly-lined face dominated by large, almond-shaped eyes as black as a moonless night. Around the stage there rose a number of sharpened stakes, perhaps ten feet tall, and affixed atop each was a child, still very much alive. The being on the throne exuded an air of almost casual boredom and, with a motion of easy indifference, extended a hand holding a golden chalice, allowing it to be filled by the blood oozing from one of the impaled children, before taking the unholy beverage to its lips and drinking deeply. A wash of sickly crimson bathing its mouth, the creature wiped away the residue with the back of its hand, drying it upon the thickly matted hair sprouting from its chest. Its dark eyes flicked to me where I stood staring, and it smiled knowingly at me and winked, the idiosyncrasies of the motion a perfect copy of the expression the animated moon had given to me earlier.
I don’t know how long I had been standing there, desperately trying to move, but too terrified to even twitch, the warmth of urine running down my leg after my bladder involuntarily emptied itself, when a voice again addressed me from behind.
“Beautiful, isn’t she? Don’t you agree with me?”
Through an intense effort of will I turned. The humanoid being was more than ten feet tall and half as wide, white and hairless, its eyeless face split open by a too-wide smile containing perhaps a hundred crooked teeth, serrated like a shark. Its long arms hung past its knees and terminated in large-knuckled hands seemingly big enough to envelop me completely and tipped with wicked-looking claws. I saw that one of the fingers had been run through a small corpse, the body dressed in a recognizable sage green outfit that revealed the identity of the speaker, of whom I had earlier made my acquaintance.
“She certainly is, Binkle,” I somehow managed to reply, my shaking voice barely a whisper. The creature’s smile widened even farther, seemingly pleased that I remembered it.
“Why is Master Trevor still not having his fun? Has he not found something that he would like to have done?”
“No. Uh, no, Binkle, that’s not it.” My entire body was shaking as I faced the monster in front of me, its hand moving the little green suited corpse in time with its words, “It’s just, I think my grandparents will be worried if I’m gone too long. They didn’t know I would be leaving, so I think it’s best that I be going home now.”
“That makes Binkle feel blue, though what you say is likely true. You’ve taken nothing and thus, still pure, Master Trevor can leave, if he is sure?”
“I’m sure,” I squeaked.
The creature named Binkle shrugged.
“In that case, Master Trevor must be going then,” it said, its blind head cocked, serpentine tongue dripping with saliva licking its fish white lips, “we’ll have fun when you visit Fey Hollow again.” It extended its arm past me in a gesture directing me back towards the entrance to the fairgrounds. On wooden legs I walked, rigid and barely keeping my balance, edging past the monster called Binkle, my hand never leaving the amulet in my pocket.
Just as I passed through the wooden archway, I heard a voice, soft and feminine, call out to me.
“Be seeing you, Trevor.”
I kept walking, strains of the silvery music still echoing in my ears, its siren song haunting my every step. Despite everything I had seen, whatever magic that powered it was potent enough to still make a part of me want to turn back.
Just as I had on my trip to reach Fey Hollow, I can’t say how long or how far I traveled to get out, just that at some point the strange eldritch twilight gave way to mundane sunshine before depositing me in a part of the forest that I recognized. I slowly lurched back to my grandparents’ house, wordless and shaken, somehow making it to the front porch before collapsing from exhaustion and fear. I don’t remember my grandmother finding me, though I think I remember her scream of fright when she did, and I have a faint recollection of my grandfather taking me up in his strong arms. At that point I completely lost track of things for a little while. When I finally woke up in the hospital a week later, my parents were there, my mother and grandmother keeping careful vigil over me.
After that it took me quite a while to remember anything that had happened that day at Fey Hollow. I suppose that’s what trauma does to you sometimes, when your mind simply isn’t capable of coping with something that it’s seen. I recovered slowly but surely, and if the adults were frustrated by my inability to tell them anything about what had put me into my catatonic state, that was far outweighed by their relief that I was getting better. That was it for my grandparents’ house for the summer, as my mom wanted to keep a more careful eye on me. I can’t rightly say why, but it wasn’t until the next year, pulling back on the shorts I’d been wearing that fateful day, that my hand found the amulet somehow still in the pocket where it had been left and the memories all came rushing back to me.
The hospital stay was shorter that time, only a couple days when I woke up. The doctors thought I must have some kind of epilepsy, though I think that was more because they couldn’t figure what else it could possibly be that was causing my fits. Nevertheless, that second shock must have been enough to inoculate me to the experience, because once I woke up again I was able to remember everything I’d seen without going back into a coma, even when I found the amulet on my dresser where my mom had put it.
I spent a lot of my free time after that just sitting in my room, studying the amulet. I took to wearing it underneath my shirt at all times; the conclusion I’d reached was that I’d rather see the scary things coming than be surprised when they got there. On weekends I started going to the library, pouring over the books in the new age and occult section, seeing if I could find anything that would tell me exactly what the pendant was, but I never really found much of anything that I could directly could attribute it to. Same with the whole concept of Fey Hollow. Sure, there were plenty of myths and stories about the fairy lands or, heck, even some kinds of extradimensional hellscapes, but for every similarity one story or another had, there were always many more things that just didn’t match up. After a while I started to question my memory of the events as they’d taken place, but every time I did my thoughts would rush right back to the amulet. I had to have found it someplace.
All thoughts of what did or didn’t happen went away the next summer at my grandparents’ house. It had taken some convincing on my mom, but I really did want to spend time with them. Besides, despite how scared I was, there was a part of me that wanted to confirm once and for all exactly what I had seen.
At first, my grandmother wouldn’t let me go out alone, but eventually I got her worn down. Wandering in the woods, it didn’t take me walking too long before I came upon that same strangely twisting path I’d found two years before. It wasn’t in the same place as the first time, but the silvery strains of music trying to draw me down it let me know beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was the same trail I’d found before. It was terrifying how hard it was for me to resist that cloying temptation, but holding tightly onto the pendant I wore around my neck, I managed to turn and walk home without looking back. That was the last time I voluntarily went walking in the woods. I thought I was free of Fey Hollow. For a while I was right.
The first time I realized I might not have got away scot-free was when I idly looked out the window of my bedroom in my parent’s suburban home, only to find the neighbor’s house and yard had been replaced by a thick, old growth forest with a strangely twisting unpaved trail running through it. The barest hint of silvery music just reached my ears before I drew the blinds.
After that, I had to be careful. Every once in a while, I would be walking down the sidewalk and, if I let my thoughts wander, would find myself heading down the forest path, the unmistakable lilt of music drawing me ever onwards, the strange eldritch stars and moon shining down on me from beneath the thick tree branches above. Once I was studying in the library, went back in the stacks to grab a book and, turning to go back to my table, realized I was on the trail to the grove. On another occasion, the music’s spell had captured me so thoroughly that I was in sight of the wooden entryway to the fairgrounds before I managed to finally realize what was happening. I can’t say the effort to turn away ever really got easier, but it certainly did get more familiar, and the time and distance I had to travel back to wherever I had left, though still unknowable, seemed to somehow shorten every time. The fear was always there though.
That continued for some long years until, abruptly when I turned eighteen, it stopped altogether. I don’t rightly know what it is about being a legal adult that did it, or if it would have made a difference if I’d been born in a country where adulthood was considered to be at an earlier or later age. All I do know is that once I hit college, at some point that first semester I realized I’d been walking to the student lounge daydreaming and hadn’t ended up wandering on the familiar forest path. At some point, after a lot of deliberation and a lot more second-guessing, I finally took off the amulet.
I’m in my thirties now. For a long while, I thought that I wouldn’t get married, but then I found a woman that I absolutely couldn’t dream of living without. I thought for sure that I would never have kids. But she wants them, and there’s no way I can deny her that either. But I worry.
If I have a child, will the grove come for them? Will they someday find themselves walking along a strangely twisting trail through ancient woods, with a full moon shining down upon them through the creaking branches, the haunting silver music drawing them onwards to the fairgrounds at Fey Hollow?  Will the strange creature Binkle greet them the way he did me and invite them to join in the fun? Will the terrible sylvan creature on the throne of bones grin and wink at them knowingly?
I still have the amulet. I don’t know how it ended up in that tree, and I don’t know what providence let me stop and grab it that first day on my way to Fey Hollow. All I know is that it saved my life, maybe my very soul. It sure didn’t stop the hollow from trying to get at me, but at the very least it allowed me to see the monsters for what they truly were. It will belong to my child, once he or she is old enough. I’ll tell them my story, although maybe I’ll leave out some of the more gruesome parts, at least at first. It’s a poor inheritance, to be sure, but it’s also a lesson all of us must learn.
Monsters exist. At some point, we all have to decide if we will open our eyes to them, or stay willfully blind. They’ll tempt us, sell us beautiful lies, and ask us to join in their fun. Even if we tell them no, should we go about our days simply floating, we may wake up to realize too late that they’ve taken us. And, if we go too long asleep, we may find we have been devoured."	9.47	19.0	Craig Groshek	01/14/2021
A Fear of Silence	"Back in 1956, I signed up for a psych experiment in college. They had a float tank, one of those sensory deprivation chambers, and they needed people willing to be closed up in it.
Easiest experiment in the world, as far as I was concerned. All they wanted was for me to lay in the water for an hour, and they were going to pay me five dollars? This was the ‘50s, mind you, so that’s like getting forty, maybe fifty dollars today. I signed up in a heartbeat. So did half the campus, judging by the line when I got there, but I got lucky in the lottery and was chosen. Well, it seemed lucky at the time.
At first, it really was the easiest money I’d ever made. I’d come in three times a week, put on a specially wired wetsuit that the eggheads had made, and climb into the tank. They’d hook me up, close the lid, and I’d just float there for an hour. For the first few minutes, I’d find myself listening to the water and smelling the salt, but soon even those would fade out and I’d just be—drifting.
I know that sounds obvious, but I don’t just mean in the physical sense. I’d come unmoored in there, completely detached from my surroundings and my self. Some of the other participants reported having visions, out of body experiences, but I never had any of that. I was always just gone. Not gone anywhere in particular; just gone.
Sometimes, it felt like they were opening the lid seconds after they closed it. Other times, I’d swear that I’d been in there for years, even decades. I’d come out of those times blinking and shocked to find that I was still a young man. I felt I’d lived lifetimes, and just somehow couldn’t quite remember them.
I was never asleep. Their wetsuit doohickeys checked on that. Alpha waves or something, I don’t know. I did fall asleep a couple of times in the early sessions, and both times I was startled awake by what sounded like a cannon firing right by my head. That was someone knocking on the outside of the tank. Let me tell you, I don’t care how deep a sleeper you think you are. The way that tank reverberated, it could wake the dead.
I never knew what they were recording or what they were looking for. They’d ask me questions when I got out, but they were always open-ended. Tell us about your experience, things like that. Then they’d just listen while I talked, pencils scratching and big cameras rolling. They were big-budget for those days. It must’ve been some sort of government grant.
They never really got their money’s worth out of me, in my opinion. I never had much to report in the aftersession. My experience was always the same: I was nowhere, doing nothing. The only difference was how long I thought it had been. I dutifully told them each time. It felt like I was in there for thirty seconds. It felt like I was in there for forty years. They wrote it all down every time and gave me my five dollars, so I was happy to keep coming back.
Then one day, it was different. I was in the tank, I was nowhere, I was nowhen. And suddenly I could sense something else. I could see it, but not with my eyes. My eyes saw only blackness, yet I had the impression of something else there. If sight were speech, then my eyes didn’t have the words to explain whatever this was.
I felt it in the same confusing way. It touched me, an exploratory caress, but not in any physical sensation. I felt ideas, felt them as textures and pressure. I wasn’t equipped to understand them that way, but somehow I felt they were negative.
And I heard it. I heard it with my ears, the sound of it. It scratched and it tore, little ripping noises like a metal rasp being dragged across a carpet. It dragged, a heavy, wet sound that spoke of rotten ooze and putrefaction. It rattled, the sound of cicada husks stirred by the wind, the noise of an old man’s dying breath. All this I heard, the only sounds ever to reach me in the tank. And quiet though they were, and lost though I was, I heard them gradually increasing in volume as they grew closer, ever closer.
I was nowhere. I was no one. Yet this thing saw me, knew me. It was coming toward me. I could almost see it, in the blankness where there should have been blackness. I could almost feel it, in the ideas running over my skin. And I could hear it, hear every blasphemous noise it made. I do not know why my ears perceived it so perfectly, but every sound it made imprinted on my brain there in the dark.
And then suddenly, I was gasping and floundering in water, a rectangle of light before my eyes. The hatch was opened, one of the experimenters offering me a hand out. He saw my confusion, my disorientation and asked, “Did you see something?”
That day, they got their money’s worth. In the light, it seemed silly, a passing fancy, but I told them of what I’d heard and experienced. I replicated the noises as best as I could, but they were never meant to be made by a healthy human throat.
Maybe I should have quit that day. But by the time I returned three days later, I had convinced myself it was nothing but a nightmare, and I wasn’t about to give up my meal ticket over something so simple. So back into the tank I went.
Again it came, while I was lost in the black. I heard it again, its terrible broken carapace scraping along the ground, dragged along by countless skittering legs. I knew it came for me, and bodiless, I tried to run. I had no way of knowing if I moved or not, though, and steadily it closed on me through whatever passed for distance here.
It was close enough for me to smell its hunger when I found myself blinking in the light again, my heart pounding.
“Something’s got you spooked,” I remember the experimenter saying to me. “Your heart’s going a mile a minute.”
In the post interview, I told them of the noises again, and they showed me a surprise. They had put a microphone in with me this time, to try to identify the source of the sounds. They played back the tape, and we turned up the volume and held our breaths. I expected to hear nothing, but thought that perhaps the microphone would detect something mundane, some rustling from the lab outside that I had blown into nightmarish proportions.
And then, to my shock—it came. The softly shredding metal, the whispering tongues, the graveyard rattle. Quietly, distant, but approaching.
“There!” I cried, pointing at the tape as if I could identify the sound with my finger. The scientists looked at me quizzically. I frowned, for the sound had stopped.
“Back up the tape,” I told them, and they did so. I listened intently, and whispered, “There…there!” as the noises started again.
“I…haven’t restarted the tape yet,” the assistant told me, looking bewildered, and I looked up to see that it was true. The wheels were still, the tape unmoving. Yet in the silence, I could hear that dreadful creature moving, hunting me.
I looked from face to face. No one but me seemed to hear it, and when they spoke to ask me to describe it, I could not hear it either. In every silence, though, it resumed. Always far away, as if it had lost the scent in the noise. But when the silences wore on, always, inexorably dragging closer.
I laughed it off that day. I told them that the dark must have gotten to me, and that I would be back the next week for the next regular session. Perhaps I even meant it then, for as long as we were talking, everything was normal. But when I left the building to walk home, I could hear its subtle pursuit in every pause.
I sang to myself out loud on the way home. I clapped my hands in the pauses where I breathed, and kept the noise going. When I reached my dormitory, I turned on my ceiling fan and collapsed onto my bed. My heart was racing, but with the steady whir of the fan above me, the unearthly noises had ceased.
Slowly, my heart calmed and I relaxed. By bedtime, I might even have convinced myself that things were fine. Certainly I was relaxed enough to go to sleep, the spinning fan maintaining a soft sentinel above my head.
In the middle of the night, I awoke with a blood-curdling shriek. I could feel the horrid, uncanny touch upon my skin, hear the rustling like a field of corn, dry and rotted on the stalks, swaying in the wind. It was here, in the room, upon me! I shouted, babbled, anything to drive it back, flailed for the lights to chase back my fears.
My roommate was out of his bed, tangled in the sheets, shouting “What is it? What is it?”
“The fan!” I cried. “Did you turn off the fan?”
“I was cold,” he said, confused.
“Never!” I told him, desperately pulling the cord. Above me, my savior spun to life, white noise obliterating the silence. “Never turn this off again!”
I apologized the next morning, blaming it on a terror of the night, but reiterated my request about the fan. He accepted my apology, but a few months later transferred rooms anyway, citing a desire for peace and quiet.
For I had become a man of constant noise. I hummed to myself, tapped my fingers on desks during tests, clicked my teeth together when nothing else could be done. I played records constantly in my room, and I slept with the fan on every night.
Technology has been a godsend for me. I spent more money than I could properly afford to have a television, that constant stream of noise. I bought eight-tracks, home stereos, every loud gadget. I eagerly embraced the Walkman in the 80s: portable sound! And powered by batteries, those tiny life-savers. I had spent years in terror of power outages, killers of all electric noisemakers. The Walkman could keep going for hours, and finally I could breathe easily when storms made the lights flicker.
These days, aged though I am, I am a smartphone user like everyone else. My contemporaries laugh at my readiness to adopt the new technology, but for me it is a matter of life and death. I do not dare let the silence descend upon me.
And yet, I think I may soon have no choice. It has been twenty years since my hearing first started to fail, fifteen since my first hearing aids. They have grown smaller and more powerful over the years, but technological advances are losing the race against my failing body. I can no longer hear the susurrus of the fan, my constant companion all these years. Conversations have grown muted. And even with my phone synced to my Bluetooth hearing aids and the volume turned high, my music gets quieter by the day.
Yesterday, as I sat alone in my house, my phone rebooted itself to install an update. In the silence it left behind, I heard shattered claws clicking greedily, something foul and pustulent dripping in an open cavern, and a horrid sliding noise like raw meat being dragged across a grater. I hobbled to the kitchen and turned on the disposal, the blender and the microwave, but even so it was just barely enough.
I think soon all my efforts will be insufficient, and at last I will have nothing left but the silence."	9.18	11.0	Micah Edwards	01/01/2021
Remember Only the Checkered Clown	"People in my hometown don’t talk about what happened during the summer of 1969. Urban legends, unsolved mysteries and tragedies can be found in the history of any small town in the world and mine is no different, yet those who remember the checkered clown know why it is best forgotten.
For the purpose of anonymity, I won’t share the name of my hometown. Most of those who know of the clown only know the twisted stories and those old enough to remember aren’t likely to share many details. Most of them would be of little help anyway. I’m quite sure there aren’t many left alive who know the truth. I may very well be the last one there is and if that’s so, it would be wrong to take that knowledge to my grave as so many have before me. As it is now, I’m staring down the barrel of old age and my youth is long gone. It’s best to come out with it while I’m still young enough to remember everything.
I was eight years old on July 14th of the year 1969. It was a sunny day, with only a few clouds drifting lazily through the sky, and even from a few blocks away you could smell the carnival.
It had been a topic of conversation amongst the boys on the block for a few weeks. Back then our little town was out of the way, surrounded on all sides by heavy forest with only a few roads connecting it to the rest of the world. Given the isolation, we didn’t see much of interest passing through our little community so, of course, the carnival was a big deal!
I remember when my mom and dad led my brother and I to the field on the edge of town. I walked happily in front of them, looking back periodically to make sure they were close behind. My dad held my little brother, Carter’s hand and they lagged behind a little. He was only 4 years old, too young to understand where we were going and I remembered he’d been especially grumpy that morning. He’d just been getting over a bit of a fever so maybe that had contributed to his sour mood. Either way, I didn’t let it dampen my own enthusiasm. As soon as I smelled the deep-fried funnel cake and popcorn I broke into a run, following the delightful smells and sounds of music.
Then I saw it, the long-awaited carnival and there was an initial rush of disappointment. I’d expected something a lot more grand than what we’d gotten. In the movies and on TV, carnivals seemed like endless sprawls of games, rides and food with a Ferris wheel looming over all of it. What was set up in that field was certainly something incredible but it was fairly bare-bones. There weren’t any rides, just booths with simple games and vendors with food. I saw a few of my friends at one of the vendors and I’d just been ready to go over and join them when a man had stopped me. It had been Mr. Woods who’d run the town library back in those days. I remember he’d always had a kindly smile and soft eyes.
“Don’t you want your tickets?” he’d asked, and in his hand I saw strings of ticket paper waiting for me. Mr. Woods’ warm smile seemed to widen as he offered them to me and I greedily snatched them up. I glanced behind me for a moment and I saw my mom, Dad and Carter right behind me. My dad just smiled at me and waved me on towards the booths. That was all the permission I’d needed.
I sprinted towards my other friends to join them in whatever game they’d been playing and my initial disappointment was quickly forgotten.
I remember that my teacher that year, Mrs. Jenkins was watching the ring toss game and that our Principal, Mr. Hughes had volunteered for the dunk tank which was practically a dream come true.
For one glorious afternoon, me and my friends got to experience a carnival. We traded tickets for treats like funnel cake and candy apples, we’d run around and played. There was even a smiling clown in a baggy white suit (who sounded a lot like my friend Michael’s dad) that painted our faces! That afternoon was almost absolutely perfect.
I’ll admit, I did lose track of my family amongst everything. I remember that I saw my mom sitting alone at one picnic table, with no sign of my dad or Carter around but I never thought much of it. I’d figured Dad had taken Carter to play some games. I had my own friends to play with and my own games to focus on! I didn’t want to drag my little baby brother around! What kid would? So I just played with my friends and enjoyed the carnival for what it was worth. We never paid much attention to what was going on in the background. I don’t think anyone did.
Most of those who saw something that day have their own stories. Some got a good look at the checkered clown, some claim they spoke with him and others only caught a glimpse of him. I fall within the latter camp.
When I saw him, he’d been walking behind the booths. He was dressed in a black and red checkered outfit and wore a cap that resembled that of a stereotypical court jester. I remember the way that the bells had jingled as he’d walked.
I’d only momentarily caught sight of his ‘face’ when he’d looked towards the children in the carnival although I can’t say I saw much. He’d kept himself covered with a black buskin mask. I remember the mournful expression on it that seemed so exaggerated. The mask looked as if it was screaming in anguish.
I’d watched him for a few minutes as he passed, popping in and out of view from behind the booths as he walked purposefully away. He didn’t hold my attention for long. Instead, I’d just gone back to my games. At the time, he’d made such a small impression and I’m sure I would’ve forgotten him entirely if people hadn’t begun to notice the missing children.
We’d only been playing for a few hours before someone started calling out for their child and in the span of a few minutes the carnival fell apart. I remember my dad emerging from the crowd of other kids who looked around in confusion as their parents called for them. He grabbed my hand and tugged me sharply away from the other children towards my mom.
I could see her head darting around frantically and over the cries of the throng I could hear her yelling a name:
“Carter? CARTER!”
There were tears rolling down her cheeks as she’d called for him and her voice was drowned out amongst several other parents screaming for their children. I remember seeing several of my friends with their own parents… And I remember that some of them had even had siblings who were now notably absent.
“Take Sean, I’ll find Carter,” my dad had said as he’d pushed me towards my mom. She’d looked up at him, silent for a moment before she’d grabbed me by the hand and led me away.
I didn’t want to go! I didn’t understand what was going on. I didn’t know where Carter had gone or why everything had so suddenly stopped. I just remember looking back at the carnival. I heard no music and the smell of food was barely lingering. What I did hear were the desperate cries of frightened parents looking for boys and girls they’d never see again.
Thirty-two children went to the carnival that day and never came home, including my brother Carter. Most of them were young, five and under but there were a few older ones as well. As for what happened, well… No one really knew. A number of eyewitnesses said that they’d seen a clown in a red and black checkered suit leading children by the hand into the woods. To that end, most of the town joined a search party hoping to recover the children but they found nothing and after a few days, they gave up. No one ever figured out just who the checkered clown had been either. I don’t think anyone wanted to believe that they’d been part of the community. I don’t recall there being much finger-pointing at the time but I can only imagine I was too young to see its full extent. If there was anyone the community blamed, I never heard anything about it, and in the end, it hardly mattered. The final consensus was that the clown had been a stranger. Some unknown, monstrous figure who’d taken advantage of the carnival to lure away some innocent children although the questions of ‘Why’ and ‘To Where’ were left unanswered for there were no answers to be found. No explanation and no ‘why’ behind it all. Those children had simply been spirited away and that was the only answer my little community had. Loss begat grief, grief became bitterness which gradually turned into acceptance and as the years went by, people seldom spoke of the carnival. It became a sour memory for those who’d lived through it and an urban legend for those who didn’t.
Moving on after Carter’s disappearance wasn’t easy but in due time I found my ways to accept that my brother was dead. Time went by. I grew up. Familiar faces aged and died off and every year the memory of the checkered clown became more and more distant.
I never left my hometown. Some of my friends did, first returning only for occasional visits that became less and less frequent before they stopped returning at all. I never resented them for that. One thing I’ve learned is that life calls people to different paths and I’d made a point to see enough of the world outside of my little bubble to know that as beautiful as it all was, there was never anywhere else in the world that I felt more at home than… well. Home. Besides, the next fifty years were kind to our little community.
Inevitably the town grew. A lumber mill opened in the 70s that brought newcomers and with them came growth. As the next fifty-one years crept by, the little hometown I’d grown up in changed into something modern and unrecognizable, and that fateful carnival was all but forgotten. Even the field it had taken place in was bulldozed and replaced by a small suburb of townhouses and as all of this happened I lived my life.
I met a girl, married her, had kids, and got old, and even I’d stopped thinking about the carnival. Every now and then it would creep into my mind, but like any bad memory, I didn’t let it linger. I’d decided long ago that there was no point in dwelling on the past. Instead, I just kept on working towards retirement and figuring out how I’d spend my twilight years and I was happy just to have that.
After the divorce, I’d gotten myself a little townhouse that I could comfortably afford. Originally I’d bought it for me and my two sons to live in comfortably while they were over but I’d inevitably ended up the only resident. My oldest son had gotten married and moved into the city about a year ago and my youngest was finishing college in another state and shooting to become a lawyer.
I was well enough alone although I can’t say it bothered me much. I had Toby for company and while my mom had died long ago, my dad was still kicking as he pushed ninety and I’d stop by for a visit every now and then.
Toby was some sort of collie mix (I think he had some heeler in him?) Originally he’d been my youngest son’s dog but when he’d left for college, Toby had stayed with me. He was an odd animal, to say the least, scrawny no matter how much he ate, anxious to the point where the fucking rain terrified him, and if I so much as stepped out of the house he’d scream blue murder until I came back. He had these big, bloodshot eyes that looked so miserable all the time and by God was he a troublemaker. I can’t say I didn’t love that dog despite his faults, though. I suppose it was nice to have something to care for and I could tell that mutt missed my boys as much as I did. We kept each other company, though.
Every Sunday morning I’d wake up a little early and cook a big breakfast of sausage and eggs. I’d make a few extra sausages for the dog and set them on a plate for him. He always seemed to appreciate that.
Then, after breakfast, I’d get his leash and we’d go on a little stroll through the neighborhood. We’d pass through what used to be downtown back when I was a boy and on the way back up, we’d pass the suburb that sat where that field once had. I didn’t often think about it. The carnival was a faded scar and the houses all looked so similar. Sometimes I might reminisce as we passed those houses but not often. Usually I’d keep walking with Toby, lost in my own thoughts all the way home.
That Sunday in March had been a bit colder than most. Most of the winter’s snow had defrosted but some fresh snowflakes drifted down from an otherwise clear sky that morning. I could see my breath out in front of me while I’d been out on my morning walk with Toby and I let him explore and nip at the snowflakes as I walked.
I can’t recall what I was thinking about as we passed the suburbs where the Carnival had once stood but my mind was elsewhere. Toby’s sudden barking was the only thing that brought me back into the moment, followed by the sudden yank on his leash. I’d looked up and caught sight of a white fluffy tail fleeing out around a house as Toby struggled against his leash. I felt it slip out of my hand but I wasn’t fast enough to stop it.
That dog took off like a shot, barking threats at that innocent rabbit as he gave chase and I was right behind him, yelling for him like a fool.
“TOBY! Get back here!”
If nothing else that dog was fast. I’m not even sure I could’ve kept up with him in my prime and by the time I’d followed him around the house all I saw was a black and white blur in the distance, heading for the trees.
“Toby!”
That damn dog couldn’t have cared less and he vanished into the woods without so much as a backwards glance.
“Alright, you little bastard,” I murmured as I reached the treeline. My boots sank a little bit into the mud and I could see the vague shape of the dog in the distance. I headed towards him, calling out again but this time he looked at me. He was panting and he had that stupid grin dogs always get on his face. I had a feeling he was going to draw this out and turn it into a game since he hadn’t got the memo that at seven years old, he wasn’t a puppy anymore. As soon as he saw me getting closer he took off a short distance away, then stopped to make sure I was still following him. While he waited for me to catch up he pranced around and rolled in the mud, probably having the time of his life in the process. As pissed off as I was, I can’t pretend that it wasn’t a little endearing.
“Alright, you’ve had your fun,” I said as I got closer to him and Toby just took off again. “Asshole…”
I took another step forward but as I did I heard the creak of old wood. Not a twig snapping under my feet. No… This sounded more like a rotting floorboard and there was a bit of an echo to it. I didn’t have much time to wonder just what the hell it was. It was just a split second later when the ground gave way beneath my feet.
With a startled cry, I dropped down into darkness and was greeted with a splash of cold water. It hadn’t been a long fall but it’d been a hard one. I’d landed on my ass and the water went up to my chest. A rancid smell filled my nostrils and I immediately began to gag. I’m not ashamed to admit that my lovely breakfast went to waste that morning.
My body ached but as far as I could tell, I wasn’t seriously hurt. In the light that filtered down from the hole I’d fallen through, I could tell that I’d only dropped about ten feet. Looking around, my first thought was that I’d fallen into some old, sealed off well. I suppose that was just my luck.
Up above, I could hear Toby barking. He was close and I saw him peek down into the pit and sniff at it before continuing to bark. I suppose the little bastard realized that something wasn’t right and was doing the only thing he logically could about it.
I fumbled around in my pocket for my cell phone and took it out. I thanked God I’d opted for a waterproof case since I’d at least be able to call for help a little more efficiently than Toby was (bless his heart for trying).
With my phone offering some light, I was allowed the chance to see my surroundings a little clearer. The water beneath me was dark, almost black and the muddy earth beneath my submerged feet felt uneven as if I were standing on rocks. When I moved, I nudged something with my foot that shifted.
On instinct, I looked down and that’s when I saw it out of the corner of my eye.
It was almost completely sunken into the dirt wall of the pit and most of it was submerged but I still recognized what I was looking at.
A human skull. The bone was brown and rotten and the lower jaw had long since fallen off. I jerked backwards, bumping against the rear wall of the pit and my eyes darted around frantically. Something broke underneath my foot. Another bone?
My pulse was racing as I looked back at the skull that had sunken into the wall. It looked… Small. Too small to be an adult.
My attention shifted to the wall behind it and followed it up. It occurred to me that a well would’ve probably had more than just an old dirt wall. Hell, there should’ve been some indicator of where it had been in the first place to prevent old idiots like me from falling in! But there hadn’t been, had there? There’d been no marker, no warning. Nothing at all.
Looking back at the skull, I could hear Toby barking frantically above me and there was only one thing to do. With a shaking hand, I dialed the police.
I was there on the scene when the Police began to remove the skeletons from the pit. After they’d gotten me out and I’d told them what I’d seen, I’d stood by watching as one of the officers descended into that pit… Or perhaps it may be more accurate to simply call it a tomb…
“We’ve got bodies down here!” I’d heard the officer call up. Bodies… That word had hit me hard.
“How many?”
“I… I dunno. Skeletal remains. Multiple corpses.”
The officer standing near the top of the pit looked pale. I can’t imagine he’d seen anything quite like this before. Our little community didn’t exactly have much crime in it and this…
I found myself staring at the pit as the officer inside climbed out. I barely heard what he’d said to his associate. My hand absentmindedly dropped down to rest on Toby’s head as he panted obliviously beside me.
My mind was racing, trying to process all that I’d seen. My body ached but I hardly noticed. That sick, sinking feeling in my stomach grew worse as I remembered the smell of popcorn and funnel cake.
“We’ll call a team in… Start getting them out of there and maybe start IDing the remains,” I heard an officer say. I saw him looking down into that mass grave and part of me wanted to tell him that I already knew who was down there. I knew that there were 32 of them and I knew all of their names…
I didn’t say a word, though. Instead, my mind wandered back to Carter for the first time in years. Little Carter, that baby brother I’d so longed to avoid… The one I’d taken off on and abandoned the first chance I’d gotten…
I knew he was in that hole, along with the rest of them. His flesh long since rotted away and what was left of his bones soon following suit.
I wondered if I’d stayed with him, if I’d watched him like a good brother, whether he would have still ended up down there, or if he and I would be living out our twilight years together.
There was no answer to that. There would never be. But still I asked the question as I stood and stared at Carter’s watery grave.
I didn’t hear a thing about the discovery outside of a surprisingly brief mention in the local news. If there was ever any word of it outside of town, it was quickly buried beneath other, more pressing news stories. I wasn’t surprised to read that they’d determined there to be 32 skeletons though, all of which belonged to children.
That said, my lack of surprise didn’t keep me from following what I could about the find. The obvious questions still hung over my head and the discovery of the bodies provided precious little resolution… I don’t suppose anyone could have explained why someone had dropped 32 children into a pit and boarded it up.
I found precious little from what searching I did do and it had occurred to me that there wasn’t enough to announce on the news yet but that felt flimsy. 32 skeletons in a pit in the middle of the woods seemed worthy of more than just a passing mention but then again, perhaps I was just an old man with skewed memories of how the world was supposed to work.
I’d gone home after my fall and stayed there, processing everything. I’d called off work for the next day as well. I assume falling into a pit in the middle of the woods was enough of an excuse to avoid work and I knew there was somewhere more important that I’d need to be.
My dad was a stubborn old bastard and as he crept closer to ninety I was sure he’d never die. Despite his age, he’d still maintained most of his independence. I’m sure if I hadn’t insisted I handle his shopping he’d still be out and about most days, ignorant to the fact that he wasn’t as young as he’d used to be and I suppose that made two of us.
I didn’t know if he’d heard about the pit in the woods. I hadn’t spoken to him on the day I’d found it. I hadn’t been sure just how to break the news to him but I knew that it had to be done.
I’d gotten up a little bit later that morning, much to Toby’s chagrin. He didn’t like it when he was denied his morning patrol of the backyard.
I’d thought about calling Dad but I wasn’t sure just what I’d say to him. The news I had deserved to be shared in person. Eventually, once I’d taken care of the dog I made myself leave the house.
Time had not left my old house alone. The tree out front I’d once climbed with my friends was long gone, as was the stump. The porch looked different and there was a new yet barren garden out beside it. Mom had set it up in her twilight years but Dad had never been able to care for it once she’d passed.
When I knocked on the front door, I didn’t wait for a response. If Dad was still upstairs I’d be waiting a good ten minutes for him to make the journey via the StairMaster.
I unlocked the door myself and as I did, I heard footsteps upstairs.
“Hi, Dad!” I called.
“Sean?”
Time and cigarettes had given my dad a rasp in his voice. He was clearly awake but I didn’t go up to bother him.
“What are you doing here? I thought it was Monday.”
“It is. I took a day off,” I called up. “I… I wanted to talk to you about something.”
“Oh? Well, gimme a minute, I’ll be right down! Make yourself at home. You know where everything is!”
I did, although I couldn’t let myself get too comfortable. I’d been out of that house for over thirty years now and so much had changed. The old floral wallpaper was gone. Most of the furniture had been replaced, and there were only a few relics of the way things had been before.
Stepping into the living room, my eyes were drawn to the pictures of Carter on the walls. Dad had kept all of them and lovingly framed them over the years, a grim reminder of what he’d lost on the day of the carnival.
On the mantlepiece was an urn with Mom’s ashes in it.
I heard the whirr of the StairMaster behind me as Dad began his descent, and I turned around to meet him at the bottom of the stairs.
He only barely resembled the man I’d grown up with. In my memories, my dad had been a tall and proud man with a bushy mustache and stern eyes. Now, though, I saw only the vaguest resemblance to the man he’d been. He was frail and hunched over. His hair was wispy and white. His jowls sagged down and heavy glasses obscured his eyes. What was left of his mustache was white, and he clutched my hand as I helped him out of the StairMaster.
“Sean…” he said softly and pulled me into a half-hug. “So nice to see you… Let me just get to my chair so I can sit…”
I clutched his hand as I escorted him into the living room and helped him ease down into his worn-in, comfy armchair. I found a seat for myself on the sofa beside him.
“There we go… I’m not as young as I used to be, kiddo,” he said, half laughing and half melancholy. “Feels like only yesterday I was here with your mom and you were bringing the kids around… How are the boys anyhow?”
“They’re alright,” I said. “Keeping busy.”
“Good… Good…” He nodded slowly and relaxed back into his chair.
“It goes fast, you know… Once upon a time, I was your age and I thought I was old…” He laughed, eyes shifting over to one of the pictures of Carter. “Look at me now…”
He looked over at me now and noticed my polite yet vacant smile. His brow furrowed.
“You’re a sorry sight… What’s going on? Did you get fired?”
“No. No, things are fine at work,” I said. I exhaled softly as I chose my words carefully.
“You see the news at all, Dad?”
“I don’t bother with it. It’s all bullshit and sensationalism these days, and I don’t much care what the world does anymore.”
I nodded. His answer didn’t surprise me.
“Why? What was on it?”
I took a few moments to answer.
“I… Well… I… I found something the other day… in the woods, out behind that suburb where the field used to be. The one where the carnival took place.”
Dad went silent. His eyes were trained on me, his brow furrowed heavily.
“There were some… rotted wood planks in the middle of the forest that covered up this pit… I didn’t see them. I stepped on them by accident and I fell. I’m not injured. I didn’t need to go to the hospital or anything! Just a few scrapes and bruises and I had my phone on me so I could call for help, but…”
I swallowed. The mental image of that skull embedded in the dirt wall of the pit rushed back into my mind. Had that been Carter’s skull?
“There were… bones… in the pit. Human bones. K-kids… I called the police. They got me out and said they’d get the skeletons out of there. I took a look on the news last night. They said there were-”
“32,” my dad whispered. I nodded. I felt a tear streaming down my cheek and wiped it away.
“I didn’t hear anything about them identifying the bodies or dating when they’d died, but…”
I looked up at my dad. He sat in his chair, dead silent. I saw tears streaming down his wrinkled cheeks.
“I’m sorry…” I whispered, but he didn’t say a word. He just stared at a picture of Carter across the room. His breathing had gotten heavier.
“I’m going to find out who I can talk to, maybe ask about Carter,” I said. “If… If they can identify his remains amongst the other skeletons, maybe we could give him a proper burial…”
Still no response from Dad. His hands were shaking and I stood up to draw nearer to him. I wanted to put my hand over his. I wanted to tell him that everything would be alright, yet as I drew nearer he grabbed me by the wrist. His eyes fixated on me and he sucked in a gasping breath. Sweat dripped down his brow and panic reared up in my chest.
Something was wrong with him.
“Sean…” he rasped, and I instinctively went for my cell phone.
“Fuck, goddamnit… Hold on!”
“S-Sean…” Tears and sweat dribbled down my dad’s face as I dialed 911. I didn’t even let the operator speak.
“I need an ambulance, right away! My dad’s having some sort of attack!” I blurted out, followed by his address.
“Sorry…” Dad whispered as he clung to my arm. His eyes closed and I held him close as the operator promised me that they’d send an ambulance immediately.
I held on to his every breath, my own heart racing in my chest, terrified that this would take a turn for the worse until, at last, the paramedics arrived.
I suppose the news had been too much for him to bear. Dad’s heart attack hadn’t killed him, thank God. But as I rode with him to the hospital in the ambulance, I was so sure I’d lose him, and I’d stayed as close to his side as I could until they’d moved him to his own room.
“We’re going to keep him for observation for a few more days,” one of the doctors had told me. “We need to be as sure as we can that there won’t be another incident after we discharge him.”
I’d just nodded in response.
“Yeah… Whatever it takes. I’ll cover the costs,” I’d said.
The day wasn’t even half over and I already felt exhausted again. I suppose I’d known that I’d need to take another day off although that hardly bothered me. My dad’s health came first.
He was asleep when I’d left the hospital. I’d stopped to get a burger in order to clear my head.
So much had happened over the past couple of days… It was hard not to feel a little bit blindsided by it all.
My mind drifted back to my dad, stuck in his hospital bed. I couldn’t imagine his mental state. Fifty years of not knowing what had happened to Carter and then, at last, something right out of the blue. I wondered what I would’ve felt if it had been my son…
As soon as I’d eaten, I headed back to Dad’s place. Since he was clearly going to be in the hospital for a while, I wanted to bring him some things from home. His medication, a change of clothes and maybe some minor things that might make his stay just a bit better. I wanted to be there for him when he woke up, I wanted him to know that he wasn’t alone in his grief for Carter.
The door was still unlocked from when we’d left and I pushed it open quietly. I glanced over at his empty armchair and at the pictures of Carter that decorated the living room before heading upstairs.
I stopped off at the bathroom first to collect his pills and then to the bedroom to get some clothes.
I’d only been in my dad’s bedroom a few times before, helping with some handiwork. The queen-sized bed had one side almost untouched and the other unmade. The room was otherwise tidy and neat.
In the closet, I spotted some of Mom’s old clothes, still hanging up as if they were waiting for her. I suppose Dad had never been able to bring himself to throw out her old things… I doubt I could’ve done it, either. It hardly mattered either way. When Dad died, they’d find new homes eventually. I pushed the clothes out of the way and found some comfortable-looking T-shirts for him to wear, as well as a pair of jogging pants with some old stains on them, among other things.
Most of his old clothes were suits or button-down shirts, which I ignored and pushed out of the way as well, to see if there was anything else lingering near the back.
Then I paused.
In the low light of the closet, it was difficult to make out the checkered pattern. I was sure it was just flannel at first, but on instinct I grabbed it and pulled it out.
The outfit hung on one hanger. The pattern was worn and frayed from the moths that had gotten to it over the years but I would’ve recognized it anywhere.
Black and red checkers. There was no sign of the mask or the hat, but there didn’t need to be.
I stared at the outfit silently, holding it up to the light as I tried to process what I was seeing, and suddenly I felt sick…
I wanted to scream. I wanted to hurl the costume away like a venomous snake or bury it in the closet and pretend I hadn’t seen it, but I did neither of those things. I just stared at it like a goddamn fool as I realized the truth…
I left the bedroom in a haze. The smiling pictures of Carter on the walls seemed to watch me, almost with an accusatory glare. I couldn’t bring myself to look at them as the tears streamed down my cheeks. I still clutched the checkered clown outfit bunched up in a grip so tight that it turned my knuckles white…
I was shaking, and as I descended the stairs I headed for the door, consumed only by single-minded purpose.
When Dad awoke, I sat quietly in the chair beside him. The machines beeped quietly around his bedside but I’d closed the door so we’d have our privacy. Outside, the sky was dim with twilight, and Dad’s uneaten hospital dinner sat on a tray by his bed along with his pills.
“Sean…”
His eyes were on me. He looked exhausted and weary.
I didn’t answer. I just stood up and tossed the worn outfit into his lap. He looked down at it, eyes glowing with a solemn recognition. His shaking fingers brushed against the old fabric. For a moment, I half expected him to have another heart attack.
He looked up at me again, mouth opening and closing as he tried to figure out what to say.
“Why?” I asked. My voice trembled with rage as I spoke.
Fresh tears gathered in the corner of Dad’s eyes.
“Sean… I…”
“WHY!?” 
My voice echoed through the room and Dad recoiled from me, panting heavily as the tears fell down his cheeks.
“Carter… He was your son…”
“I… I had to…” Dad’s voice was weak and mournful. “We had no choice… The fever… The sickness… We didn’t know what to do…”
“What? What are you talking about? What fever? What sickness? There was no fucking sickness!”
“There was!” Dad snapped. “You were too young, you didn’t understand! It came on so suddenly… It was a smaller town back then, the nearest doctor was in the next town over! P-people started getting sick, they started dying and we were scared! We didn’t know what to do… The adults… The ones who were sick, they knew to stay away. But the children? They didn’t understand and it was spreading so fast! Then they started dying and… and we couldn’t watch… We made a choice, Sean. We made a choice all those years ago, the only choice we could make! We chose mercy over suffering! It was the only choice!”
“To kill the children,” I whispered. “You murdered them…”
“We agreed… No one wanted to know who’d done it. The men, we held a lottery and I lost! We put on the carnival to get the children who weren’t sick together, so they wouldn’t ask questions… So they wouldn’t know what was going on. Then we rounded up the others… Kept them away from the rest of the kids and one by one I took them into the woods… I took them to the pit we’d dug. I had a knife… They didn’t suffer, Carter didn’t suffer! Not like he would have if we’d let the fever claim him, and the parents didn’t suffer, either! They didn’t need to watch their children die!”
I stood there, watching my dad cry as he uttered his confession. I remembered the pictures of Carter on the walls, staring at him for every hour of every day of the rest of his life after the carnival…
“After that… I… I never spoke of it. We’d all agreed the checkered clown would be anonymous and we could leave him behind. With the children gone and the last of the fever quarantined, we… we could move on. Start again and it worked, Sean! It worked…”
He reached for my hand but I pulled away from him.
“I’m sorry…” He whispered. “But it had to be done…”
I just stood there, silent as my dad looked into my eyes. I couldn’t find the words to say. All I could do was stare.
Behind me, I heard the door open as a nurse stepped in.
“Everything okay in here?” she asked. “I heard shouting?”
I didn’t give her an answer. Instead, I just pushed past her and out into the hall, leaving my dad behind.
I got the call about his suicide the next morning.
He’d overdosed on his pills. A nurse had found him just an hour before, lying in his bed and wearing that faded, checkered clown suit.
I imagine he died peacefully, and despite his sins, I’m glad that he did.
Part of me wishes I’d had a better chance to say goodbye, but at the same time, I don’t think I could’ve ever looked at him again without feeling disgust.
I’ve heard very little about the skeletons uncovered in the woods. It’s just a footnote to the legend that started in that summer of 1969, and I suspect that legend will haunt my hometown forever.
But I won’t let it haunt me.
At long last, I know what happened that day, and I don’t know if the answers have made me feel better or just left me hollow. Either way, it’s clear to me that I can’t stay there. It’s time for me to find another home."	9.88	24.0	Ryan Peacock	12/26/2020
A Christmas Angel	"Garbage lined the quiet street with dirty papers, bottles, and cans. One trash bin tipped on its side with a wretched smell of old beer and cigarettes from behind a bar that overlooked a small alley. A slight breeze blew down the run-down alleyway of the city that seemed to have long forgotten snow angels, Santa Clause, and the meaning of Christmas.
The sound of footsteps appeared from nowhere. A thundering shatter against the wet pavement that seemed to make the rats run toward an old sewer drain.
A child’s red tennis shoe hovered just on the edge of the drain. No one ever wondered where it came from; it was just there. You ever see an item of clothing on the side of the street and wonder what the story was behind it? In the case of the mysterious shoe, there was a story that wanted to be told.
The footsteps continued until they reached the back of the old Town Tavern bar and grill. He stopped suddenly to look around in a panic. From there, he looked up at a small window that was cracked not too much- just enough for an easy break-in. The building was completely dark, and he assumed it was just wasted office space above the bar. The man seemed to be running from something if not to something. He had cased the place too quickly, or he would have never made entry into this establishment.
James had just robbed the corner market, blowing the man’s brains out that stood behind the counter. The image still burned inside his mind as he ran towards the back of the bar. James knew he’d be facing life in prison. It wasn’t meant to be this way. He had fallen on hard times recently. Drugs became his only way of surviving the harsh reality that had become his life. Using the tipped over trash bin as a stepping stool, he managed to climb up and stuck his fingers inside of the hole in the glass. He moved as quickly and as quietly as he could, unlocking the latch to slide the window open. Why anyone would think this would keep a stranger out, let alone the man in question, was a mystery.
Once inside, he realized that it was someone’s home. Why on earth would anyone live there? It was a dump. There were dog or cat feces in the room, and on the floor was a mattress. He grew sickened when he realized that it was a makeshift child’s bedroom. On the wall above the mattress were drawings, and a stuffed animal was lying on the bed. A dim light was coming from down the hall. James smelled something that sickened him. He nearly lost his breakfast of beer and old French fries. He hadn’t had a proper meal in weeks.
James slowly walked down the hallway, and the smell grew worse, making him want to run back out of the window. Something made him keep going. Perhaps this was his punishment for killing the man at the store. The older man had been nice to him on many occasions.
The store owner would allow him to take food out occasionally, but this one night, James needed the cash. He was ready to come out of his skin the way, so many junkies were.
There were worse things in this world as he would soon find. Making his way further down the hallway, he began to smell what could only be described as death. James covered his mouth and nose in disgust as he made his way towards the end of the hall. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but he knew that most likely, the owner of the bar lived here. Cash was still necessary. James had panicked too quickly after shooting the older man. He ran too soon before he could what little money there was in the drawer.
So, James found himself in this building with the smell of Hell in his nose.
He walked further, and there was a door half-cracked with a small lamp on eliminating a low light. The room was where the smell was coming from as it encapsulated his nose, making him sick instantly as he opened the door. It squeaked as it slowly revealed the horrors from within.
Three bodies were sitting on the couch. One was a woman, and the other was of a man and the third. He didn’t even want to look at her. The third body was of a child, and the two adults covered in death with coagulated blood. He slowly closed the door when he heard a tiny voice cry out.
“Hello?”
Did he now hear things? Was his guilt haunting him?
“Can you help my mommy and daddy?”
James froze in terror. Was she a ghost come to collect his soul after what he had done?”
“Hello?” he heard her squeak. She sounded hoarse.
Then he heard a cry. The little girl was no ghost.
He opened the door, and he saw her tiny frame standing between the two dead bodies of her parents.
“Are you Santa Clause?”
James looked at her for a second. He didn’t understand until he happened to catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror hanging on the wall in the small room. He had a full gray beard that was nearly white to go along with his long wavy white hair. Strange for someone in their early forties to have achieved such an accomplishment. James recalled getting his first gray hair in his early thirties, and his father said it was a sign of wisdom. He didn’t believe that it was a load of shit.
He didn’t say anything as he looked down at the little child. She wore one red tennis shoe. The other god only knew. The apartment was cold, and he could see she had not eaten in days. Instead, she tugged at her shoestring while she talked to James the only way a small child could.
“Where is your other shoe?” he asked her, managing to smile.
“I lost it when the bad man tried to take me with him. I had to get back to mommy and daddy. He dropped me, and when I woke up, I was here. He’s gone now. He made daddy give him all our money for Christmas. Then he made mommy cry. She stopped crying.”
Talk about hard luck. The family had already been robbed. The killer deserved to be caught, but he would be long gone by now. James deserved to be found out too. It was Christmas, which he only realized when he looked at the calendar on the wall of the tiny living room. Looking around, James noticed a child-like drawing of a Christmas tree hung on the wall, and hand-drawn ornaments decorated it in crayon. He wanted to die suddenly. He thought of the man at the store, and he too had a family.
James looked at her, blinking into focus. He picked the little girl up, and they walked out of the room. They continued down the hallway to the stairs and descended them.
His heart was breaking for this child. Tears wet his eyes, and then she wrapped her arms around his neck, feeling the safety and the warmth of his neck. A neck covered in tattoos, and even though he smelled from not bathing in days, she nuzzled her head inside of his neck. He gathered it felt better than being in this room with decaying carcasses.
He wasn’t sure where he was taking her. When he got out into the cold, he heard sirens just up the street. James knew they would be looking for him. There were cameras in the store where he had killed that man.
James heard a sound suddenly, and when he turned around, he saw something that he would never understand till the day he died. A woman and a man stood by the sewer drain. Behind them was a light that reminded him of what it must be like to go to heaven.
A woman and a man watched him seemingly untainted by humanity. There was something otherworldly about them. The woman had long brown hair, and her cheeks had a creamy ivory glow to them. The man had bright blue eyes, and they smiled at him. James recognized them now as the ghosts of the little girl’s parents.
James felt the child growing limp in his arms. Then he saw a little girl appear between the man and the woman. It couldn’t be the same little girl he carried in his arms!
It was, and when he looked down at the child, she too was now as dead.
James stood in bewilderment.
“You have shown an act of true human kindness.”
“I don’t understand; she was just here talking to me.” James began to cry, and his voice grew hoarse.
The woman and the man approached him. They placed their warm hands upon his shoulder. “Everyone deserves a second chance.” the man said.
“You tried to save me,” the little girl said, placing her pink hand inside of James’s dirty one. “Thank you, and you’re my angel.”
Within moments James found himself back in that corner store staring at the man as the gun was nearly about to go off. James blinked as though he were in a dream.
“Shit!” He dropped the gun.
“Son, are you okay?” asked the old man.
“I-I don’t – I’m sorry!”
“Hey, come back! I can find someone to help you!”
James backed out of the store, running into traffic. He almost knocked over a woman ringing a bell for the Salvation Army.
“Merry Christmas!” he yelled as he ran by.
As he ran, he began to smile, realizing that Angels had to be real, and he was saved by one.
James turned his life around after that night. He realized that life was short and precious. He had no one to thank but the little girl who saved his life — a Christmas Angel."	9.73	11.0	Craig Groshek	12/20/2020
Solomon’s Vault of Creepy Terrors	"His voice was like silk.
It could move you through the confines of your world without even trying. Every breath, every sigh was like a longing that came from a faraway place. His hypnotic, serene, and at times erotic overtones crooned across the audience moaning and groaning when it afforded him. Even in the cold darkness, he crept up upon you when you were alone in your bedroom at night. He could find you in the car when you were on that long stretch of highway in the early morning twilight just before dawn. He was there, watching and waiting, just for you and no one else. He wants you for himself, and all he did was read the sentence in front of him to listen. You bend at will giving him your undivided attention, and every phrase made deliberately to invite you in for more. He could tear you away from your hiding place and drag you kicking and screaming for more. Yet, these were not words of a man reciting poetry. These were stories read to you to arouse fears from the unconscious mind into the open. These were tales of murder, ghosts, and all forms of human decay and evil. Like a skull cracked in half spilling out the red from within, he would get it out of you, those fears, those desires, and evil deeds. Then, as though he only wanted you to give him what he craves, he just fades back into the darkness from whence he came.
At least that is what the latest issue of a well-known online magazine had written about my now nationally syndicated podcast. I think it was pretty kind of them, making me sound so dark and mysterious. I could die soon and be happy. I had satisfied so many ears with my languid tones and perpetual lust for life and well death. All the intricate little pieces of our existence wrapped up into this flesh, bone, and life force on a constant drip. That life force is big business in horror, and trust me, I have known my share of it as I lie here dying. I will share my tale of horror of how I landed here if you care to listen.
In a period of loneliness, I started writing horror fiction for fun what most now refer to as Creepypasta, and I did it long before it became cool to write those stories. I was writing them and submitting them to magazines under random fake names. When the narration phase began, I thought that it was cool. I was one of those cocky jock types, and I enjoyed this idea of being someone different than who everyone knew as just the college football player. So, I began my storytelling, deciding to start my online podcast, and every Sunday evening after dark, I read tales of the macabre. At first, to a small audience, which grew over the years, and I can now boast over a few million fans. It was called Solomon’s Creepy Vault of Terrors, and I ended it the same way each week.
”That’s all, for now, my children, thank you again for listening. And as always, don’t forget to lock your doors, lock your windows, shut your blinds and close your closet doors. You just never know who may be watching and waiting in the shadows. Till next time this has been another tale of fear from Solomon’s Creepy Vault of Terrors.” Everyone figured my name must be Solomon, but nothing is really as it seems. I had always liked Solomon’s name because it had this non-threatening aura about it, and it made it all the more sinister.
My family and friends knew me as Pete from Poughkeepsie. Yes, that is right. My name is Peter. Nothing is ever what it seems, and you should remember that because it is one of life’s harshest lessons. I always had the notion I would have been an actor because I was told I was particularly good looking, the all-American pretty boy type dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes and tight physique. I could have even been a writer with my wild imagination for spinning tales, but in college, I quickly discovered that there wasn’t real money in any of that. I was good with numbers, so I got a job at a brokerage firm south of Cleveland, and that is how I decided to make my living, which I enjoyed because I made a lot of money. I had moved to Cleveland with my girlfriend, Beth because she was attending College at Cleveland State University for her master’s in social work. It wasn’t long before we realized I wasn’t right for her. I mean, it is hard to love a guy when you are more attracted to women. I guess college is a weird time for a lot of girls.
 
So, at the ripe old age of 26, I was single and dating extraordinarily little. I was also bored, and it was the first time in nearly five years that my podcast had sort of taken a downward spiral. The stories just were not good anymore. I had been getting submissions, and soon I had run out of good stories. There was no shortage of hateful comments on my website, and I had even started allowing my fans to donate money to me to let my site go on. I’d narrate one of their stories for a particular amount, and honestly, there were some good ones. However, the people who paid the most to have me read their stuff were always bad writers and even worse storytellers. To make them feel special, I would send them little gifts, such as postcards with my signature, in the mail from my P.O. Box. I hoped with this newly found focus would come better stories. It worked for a while; then again, things had also become incredibly competitive. It seemed like every day, a new narrator was popping up, and I had to keep up or else lose my fans. Why should it even matter? In truth, it didn’t, but being as reclusive I had become, my fans gave me a reason to get up in the morning. It didn’t matter. They had no idea who I was or even what I looked like. I guess we all wear our masks, eh?
To top it off, I had started becoming more stressed at work. My boss became more and more of an asshole. The only thing that kept me there was a growing friendship I had with a girl named Kim. She was gorgeous in one of those soap opera ways with her hair and make-up done like a movie star. She had long light red hair, green eyes, and traces of freckles along with her nose and cheeks. Don’t get me started on her legs when she walked in pair of stilettos – she was hell on heels. To be honest, she made me a little crazy, and I guess you could say I had a secret crush. I thought of asking her out a million times, but what if it ended badly? I worked with her, and that could lead to some seriously uncomfortable working conditions.
After a particularly stressful Tuesday at work, I was invited to grab a few drinks with the other guys from the firm. One drink leads to another, and I was feeling rather good. The guys left, but I stayed on a bit longer just for one more beer. I lost track of how many drinks I had. I didn’t feel drunk when I sat in the car and put my keys in the ignition. I sat and closed my eyes for a moment. I could feel the dizziness beginning, and I leaned my head on my hands. Maybe if I just rested a few moments. No, I had to keep on going, because I was in the condition to make intelligent life choices.
You always feel invincible after a few drinks, and I sped off keeping one eye open and one closed to follow the lines on the road. The road I chose to go home one was a lonely stretch of road covered on both sides with deep dark woods and tall grass in an isolated area not far from the bar district I had just left. There were no signs of civilized life, and I noticed something brown and grey in the distance just off to the right side of the road. It appeared to be something that looked like an animal. I kept going not to give a care in the world if it was or how fast I was now going. I tried to swerve around it but ended up hitting something even though I didn’t think I was going very fast. It flashed past me banging and making this strange crunching sound something flew past my hood and then I felt a thud. I slammed on my brakes, all in what seemed an eternity was only a few seconds. I was wide awake now.
I had been driving through an area known to have once been an actual town until the national park service bought up the houses and designated the city as part of the Cuyahoga Valley national park. There were no longer people living in the homes to run to for help. All the houses belonged to the National park. It had been several years since anyone had lived in the shells of the previous occupants. The homes were dark and desolate, and I quickly realized there was no one to help me if I needed it. I slowly got out of my vehicle, car running, and headlights on so I could see. I walked over to the side of the car and realized that something had spilled all over the hood. What was this a can of paint or something? There was so much of the dark liquid it covered almost the whole front right part of the windshield and hood. I heard a sound of something that echoed the sound of a dripping faucet.
When I walked around the back of the car, that is when my annoyance turned to terror. I thought I knew terror and could evoke it with a flick of my pinky finger. I could strike fear with my stories, but nothing prepares you for realizing you have just come face to face with life in HD terror. I panicked, not understanding the enormity at first. A man’s body lying about 30 feet behind my vehicle just sprawled out half into the stretch of road and into the tall grass that lined the side of it, I thought maybe he was okay? Perhaps I could call an ambulance and get him help I rationalized.
Only when I saw his body did I see the full magnitude of what I had done to this man. His head was no longer fully attached to his body, and he had only a small amount of tissue connecting his head to his neck. I vomited on the spot.
 
The sound that mimicked a dripping faucet had been the blood sliding down my front windshield down the right side and dripping off the rearview mirror onto the puddle of blood that matched it on the ground beneath it. I will spare you any further details. Let us just say it was terrible.
I was too scared to call the cops at this point. Fear or something took over, and I was in freak out mode. I have no idea what made me do it, but I remembered I had a shovel in the trunk of my car and dragged this man’s remains to the side of the road. I had to act quickly, so I found a spot near the road which was still obscured by some trees, and I dug the most bottomless hole using the flashlight on my cell phone to light my way. I was tired and sick, but I dug and dug till I figured if it were deep enough that no animals would dig it back up. I tried to get as much blood off my windshield as I could standing there in the dark. Lucky for me, there was little blood on the road; most of it was on the hood of my car and in the grass. Part of you is probably wondering why I had buried him. I don’t know honestly except that I had the urge to hide it as though it never happened.
Later that night, when I arrived home, I cleaned my car until it was spotless and threw away my suit. I wanted to forget that this night ever happened. I collapsed into my bed and fell into a deep sleep. The next day I kept thinking it was all a bad dream, and I half expected the cops to come and arrest me at work.
A few days turned to weeks, and I checked the missing person info and looked for any information in the newspaper to see if someone matching the man’s description was listed. I checked it every day for two months, and then one day, I stopped. It was apparent there wasn’t anyone to come looking for this guy. Slowly, I stopped caring about it and went on with my life. I moved on as best I could and turned to my fans and my podcast for comfort. Eventually, I began to feel like my old self, and I wanted my life to feel as normal as possible. I continued my work and my stories as usual, but something slowly began to happen.
Reading the stories aloud one evening, live on air, I slowly felt the air go out of my passion because it was apparent the podcast had grown stale. I even noticed in my live chat that my many fans had seemingly grown bored of the stories. The stories that I received didn’t have anything new to offer in the ways of an exciting plot. It felt like every story was recycled and copied from those that had already been done. They had grown bored of me, and the stories didn’t feel fresh anymore. That is when I suddenly had an epiphany. Maybe I should tell my own true horror story. Yeah, I know what you are thinking. What if someone figured it out? It would be under a fake submission name just to be safe. In that second, a new alias was born. He would become quite an influence in the months to come; only I had no idea then how much.
“So, everyone, I don’t want you to go away tonight empty-handed. I see you there, Focker234. I know what you are craving. Yes, bluegirl20. I see you there too, and I have just the story for you. You are an angel, and you deserve no less. Now let me tell you the story I have been saving for last. This is a new writer who was a little shy to submit his story, but now he is finally ready to tell it. He recently submitted a gruesome tale for you all that I know you are going to love. He goes by the username-” I paused for a second trying to think of the perfect name, and then it hit me. “The Woodsman.”
I began my story about a man who was out for a walk and gets hit by a car. However, instead of dying, he is buried alive by the man who kills him. It was brilliant, and they all loved it. I spun that tale with the first-person knowledge of the blood splatter, and the way it flew up onto the car, no one could have told a better story. I was back at the top by morning.
It went smoothly for the next few weeks, and it wasn’t long though before even that got tiresome. I tried to find great stories, but it was the Woodsman they wanted. How could I recreate another tale? I couldn’t just go around looking for crimes, could I? It wasn’t until I hit upon another stroke of luck while out shopping at the local Wal-Mart. You see, one of the things I hate most is shopping at Wal-Mart. I mean, I loathe it. I only go there on occasion for fish food. I own these stupid cichlids, and they eat these tropical flakes, and Wal-Mart carries the flakes dirt cheap. So, as I was walking, I see this woman with her two small children. She was okay, not hot or anything. I mean, who is at Wal-Mart? She was just walking to her car when this drunk guy jumps out and yells at her.
“Get the hell in the car, Amy! What took you so damn long, anyhow?” I see him pull her in and toss the kids in the back, no car seat. It made me mad, to be honest, and I decided to follow them. The guy pissed me off the way he was treating them. I had never done anything like this before in my life yet, I found myself wanting to hurt this guy, and I didn’t even know him. When I saw where they lived, I felt even sorrier for those kids. To say it was filthy is an understatement. I found myself pulling in their driveway, and I stopped, got out, and grabbed a ball bat from my trunk. I felt like I was in a trance of some sort. I felt possessed, and then I heard crying, and I saw those poor kids fearful for their lives. I just wanted to kick this guy’s ass. You could tell this was typical life for them, and I felt absolute anger rush through me. I banged on the door.
“Who the hell is at the door?” I could hear the man yelling.
“I don’t know!” I heard a woman’s voice say.
They were making sounds, and I was afraid suddenly. They would see my face! I was too stupid to think things through. I didn’t even have a mask or a hoodie to keep myself covered, and what made it worse was parked in their driveway in the open. I ran away from the door and back to my car, pealing out of the driveway. What the hell was I thinking? Then the dark thought came to me. It was almost as though I could see The Woodsman speaking to me telling me I could wait it out. I could wait for him. For the rest of the night, I waited for this piece of garbage. I had parked towards the end of their long drive. There were few homes, and I hid my car where no one could see it in the stacks of deadwood and brush that went along their house. I saw him eventually come out of his house. He stumbled to a seat on his porch and sat down. It was my chance to pounce on him, and it was now or never.
I managed to go unnoticed and, in one swoop, grabbed him and pulled his drunk ass into the woods near the back of his house. He was completely unaware of what waited for him in the dark. With one swing of the bat, I had bashed in his skull. What was one more waist of human consumption? I hit him again until blood-splattered, splitting his head in two. I found myself smiling as his blood hit my cheek. That would be one detail The Woodsman would recall for me. It would be one gruesome tale, for sure. I grabbed my shovel this time, deciding to bury the guy right there in the far corner of his back yard.
The next night I prepared my newest story for my listeners. Of course, The Woodsman was such a brilliant and descriptive storyteller. I complimented my listeners for sticking by me, and I ended the show in my usual way. “That is all for Solomon’s Vault of Creepy Terrors and remember to lock your doors, lock your windows and shut your blinds and close the closet doors you never know who may be lurking in the shadows.” In the case of the drunk guy, it was me.
I woke up the next day and felt alive and excited. I jammed out to music, yelling it in my car as I sped into work. My evil method of storytelling went on, and there was more than one victim now. Weeks and weeks went on, and I spun my tales to my audience; I even got to the point where I felt the Woodsman had completely taken over. He was the new star of “Solomon’s Vault of Creepy Terrors.”
I told each one of them and even left in specific details of truth like where they were buried, what they wore and how they were killed. There were also a few close calls when I thought my work had gotten sloppy. Still law enforcement never got involved. I mean no one had a clue and it helped most of The Woodsman’s victims were shady characters no one would miss.
I met a girl named Veronica on one of those stupid dating apps. It was a discreet dating app aimed at hooking up busy professionals. I was a very busy professional, even a prestigious man of mystery, now wasn’t I? I could barely keep up with all the stories. I now had the inspiration for a week, and it had been going on for nearly a year now.
Veronica had brown hair, olive skin, and dark brown eyes, and hot for me the moment we met. I had lied to her and given her a fake name so that she couldn’t contact me after tonight. I just wanted a hook-up and nothing more. It had been a bit of a dry spell in that department. That night she came up to me in the bar, recognizing me from the photo I had of myself online.
“Jason?” her voice was nervous as she looked up at me. I was a foot and a half taller than she was. I was 6ft tall, and most women I tended to date were about my height, but she was short, and I didn’t mind it; she was gorgeous.
“You must be Veronica then.” I took out my hand and placed it on hers and she shivered. She clearly thought I was good looking the way she smiled shyly up at me. It was almost too easy. I stood there in my suit looking very G.Q. and we took our seats at the table the hostess led us to. I made sure I made her feel like the only woman in the world so we chatted only about her. We talked very little about me, which is how I wanted to keep it. I lied and had told her I was a small business owner.
She told me she was a secretary for a law firm. We got on very well and we seemed to be enjoying ourselves. I made sure I didn’t have more than 2 drinks but she had more, and eventually, we ended up in my apartment. I wasn’t worried as I had planned for this night all along. I hid any evidence of who I was, and I made a mental note to delete my account with the sordid app the next morning. She was like putty in my hands, and I kissed and caressed her. I was the perfect lover.
As we finished our lovemaking, I looked down into her eyes and kissed her holding her neck with my right hand and lower back with my left. I moved my left hand up, slowly continuing in the massaging motions moving closer to her neck with my left hand. As I looked in her eyes, I thought to myself how easy this was going to be. I looked deep into her eyes; suddenly, with both hands on her throat, I began rubbing her neck softly and then growing more intensely with each stroke. Something overcame me, and I started touching her in a fastidious motion. I moved faster, and then I saw the panic in her eyes. She wanted to stop me, but I simply snapped her neck.
I had not planned to kill her. I only became overwhelmed by the desire to after I had satisfied my needs. She was perfect and would be my new muse for the latest tale from The Woodsman.
I wrapped her up in plastic and got rid of her body. As usual, I dug a bottomless hole and threw her and her stupid purse in with her. I destroyed her cell phone, and I tossed its pieces into a lake by a local park I ran through sometimes.
The Woodsman brought another story to his listeners, and this one was a lesson of meeting strangers online. I mean, nothing was ever what it seems. They all had lessons to be learned, whether it be the drunk guy who beat his wife or the guy who didn’t look both ways before crossing the street.
It was far from the beginning of my newly found confidence, and it was not long before I finally got the guts to ask Kim out on a date. The first date we went and got ice cream. The second we saw a movie and the third we made love on her sofa as her cat looked at us in what I can only figure must have been disgust.
 
She was sweet and caring, and I found myself falling for her pretty hard. Kim brought about such kindness in me, and I hoped someday to put my ways behind me. Pretty soon, I was almost the guy I was before The Woodsman had taken over.
I had given up caring about The Woodsman. I even told my listeners that he had not sent anything in a long time. I struggled to get rid of him as I found myself wanting to spend more and more time with Kim.
Eventually, the time had passed, and she met my family. I had not yet met hers, but she had not been close to her family growing up. She claimed they were dysfunctional and embarrassing. Her father was a drunk, and her mom died when she was in high school. She even had a younger sister she had not seen in years. She had been on and off drugs for years, and they had lost touch.
 
Kim and I had been dating for a long while when I had decided to tell Kim about my little podcast, “Solomon’s Creepy Vault of Terrors.” I wondered what she would think and if she would think I was this colossal nerd. I didn’t tell her how I got some of the stories. When I finally confessed to her about it and why there were all these laptops and extra equipment in my office, she laughed and said she would have to go back and listen to my older programs. We had a good laugh about it, and I even encouraged her to go back and look. Slowly I began to realize I wanted to leave that life behind me. I had started to think about my future, and I was almost 30. I wanted to take my life more seriously and give up my tales of terror. When I decided to marry Kim, I had also decided to retire from my podcast. I would let some other thirsty podcasters take my place.
I had left work early on a Friday, telling my boss I would be off Monday. I wanted Kim and me to go away for the weekend. Maybe stay at a Bed and Breakfast on the Lake and just enjoy one another’s company after I popped the question over dinner.
That night Kim came over to my apartment. She smiled and looked at me when I got on one knee she was overcome with emotion. Kim cried, and then we laughed, and we hugged. She was crying so hard that I looked down at her. Her face was a mess, and she had mascara running down her face. I laughed at her, amused that I had made her cry so hard.
I turned my back only for a second to grab a tissue from the counter, and suddenly I felt a stinging pain in my lower back. It burned, and I lost my balance and fell to the floor. When I looked to grab for Kim, I realized she was holding a large butcher knife in her hand, and I went to get up and saw her coming for me again. She stabbed me a second and a third time. I was helplessly unable to stand up. It was all happening so fast, and she must have hit a nerve when she stabbed me. The wound was buried, and there was blood everywhere. She finally stopped, and with tears welling up in her eyes, she bent down beside me, holding my face with her bloody hands.
“I love you so much, but you are a sick baby.” She kissed my forehead, and tears were welling up again in her eyes as were mine. I could not speak and was breathing heavily, holding on to my stomach, still confused when I noticed she was getting something out of her purse. She grabbed her cell phone, and I thought she would call 911 after nearly stabbing me to death. Instead, she opened it up to a photo of a girl pointing the phone in front of my face. I didn’t know who I was looking at, and my eyes were blurred with tears. The photo was of the girl I had killed standing in the same red dress I had last seen her in. I blinked hard, trying to focus, and I moved away from the photo pushing it away from my face. This was not happening.
“This is Julie. This is my sister. Last time I saw her, she was going on a date with some mystery guy-you! She gave you a fake name, Peter. What was the name she gave you?” she acted as though I could answer back I couldn’t speak. I was too stunned to utter a sound. “Veronica was the name she gave you, but that wasn’t her real name. I knew all about it, and we planned to have breakfast the next morning, but she never showed up. I thought maybe she forgot, but she was missing for days. I was afraid she had started using drugs again.” She tearfully choked on her own words. “This isn’t revenge; you are just an animal that needs put down. I love you too much to let you live like this. I have loved you since we first met that day at the firm, and when you finally asked me out, I was so happy. Only I didn’t realize you were ill, and no doctor could ever help someone like you.” I was bewildered and barely hanging on for life. I was soon going to be blacking out from the loss of blood. I was still confused about how she knew, but she continued her story, sobbing in between breaths.
“That night you told me you were that guy reading those stupid stories, I listened to some of your old podcasts. That is when I knew what you had done. The way you described the tale of the Girl in the Red Dress, was that the name? You talked about how she looked all the way down to what she had on and how she smelled. I knew then you were the one that hurt her. I don’t know how I knew, but I just knew, and you were hurting all those other people. They weren’t just stories, were they? I had to stop you so you couldn’t hurt anyone else.”
I wasn’t sorry till now, and tears fell suddenly from my face. I felt ashamed, and I was invincible until this very moment. Kim sat next to me and held my hand, and I didn’t even bother to push her away. I didn’t want to die alone as insane as this all was. I loved her, and I knew I deserved my punishment, but I tightly held her hand, closing my eyes till I saw nothing but black. I am not sure how much time passed, but I awoke alone lying on my kitchen floor in a dried blood pool. How was I still here? I couldn’t feel my legs, but I managed to crawl to my desk where my recording mic was. I was bleeding fast, and instead of dialing 911, I knew I’d be dead before the ambulance came, so why not one last story before I went. I’d record this just for you, my loyal fans. Maybe someone will find this recording and broadcast it at some point on my behalf.
I can hear you now thinking Kim will get in trouble for her crime, because here I am confessing it all to the world, and she doesn’t deserve that. It is okay, though, because Kim isn’t her real name, anyhow. You still believe I am Pete from Poughkeepsie. Perhaps this is just a tale to warn you about the downside of greed.
Like I have been saying, nothing is ever what it seems. But don’t fear there is a lesson to be learned as I lay here ready to find me. Can you guess what it is? Well, if not, you soon will.
The Woodsman taught me how to be who I was meant to be. What will he teach you? I bid you goodbye one last time as I lay here waiting on my new life on the other side of the door. I can hear voices just down the hall coming for me.
Well, guys, this has been the final episode of Solomon’s Creepy Vault of Terrors. Remember to lock your doors, lock your windows, and close your blinds and closet doors you never know what is waiting in the shadows…"	10.0	11.0	Craig Groshek	12/17/2020
The Dark Thing	"I live in a small town in America’s heartland where nothing much ever happens. People go to work and go to church, and everyone pretty much knows everyone else. We all shop at the same stores send our kids to the same schools. There are picnics at the town square on holidays, and seldom do we have a crime more serious than vagrancy.
Some might call our little town quaint or even dull, but I would argue that point. It’s a tradeoff. Maybe we don’t have the same opportunity for excitement that many places across the country have, but we don’t live in fear, either. You can leave your car and your house unlocked if you choose, and you don’t have to worry about having your stuff stolen. You can walk alone down any street in town and not worry about being attacked or even hassled in any significant way. People can let their children play in their yards without watching them every second. Yeah, it’s a tradeoff, excitement for safety, but one we feel a pretty fair bargain—until lately.
Though rather insignificant by most crime standards, about two weeks ago, people’s pets started disappearing. And I’m not talking about two or three pets over that period, I’m talking about several a day. By last count there had been twenty-six pets gone missing—mostly dogs, but a few cats as well. Curiously, most of those pets had disappeared from their owner’s backyards, often fenced in with no apparent points of egress; so it wasn’t as though these pets were just wandering off or anything. Also, as far as I know, none of the pets that’ve gone missing have been found.
My neighbor across the street, Mr. Braswell, has lived in his house for about forty years. Since his wife passed a few years back, he’s been living there alone—well, him and his German shepherd. He calls him Soldier. Anyway, Soldier went missing the night before last. I found Mr. Braswell out at his mailbox yesterday morning, and he told me what he’d seen of it.
He told me that he’d let Soldier out back—in his well-fenced yard—just before bedtime as he always did. The moon was mostly full, so he could see his dog run along the perimeter of the fence toward a back corner. That’s when he first saw it—though he couldn’t really explain what it was. He said it was like a large, dark mass, just sort of resting along the back fence. Strangely, though, he said it wasn’t something he could discern the details of, but it was more like a space where the moonlight just didn’t illuminate. He said he could tell Soldier saw it, too, because he’d stopped and looked at it, his tail and ears at attention. He thought he’d heard Soldier growl, and then he’d simply run toward and disappeared inside the black mass, almost like he’d run through a portal.
Let me be clear about something. I’m not one to be critical of the elderly, especially of someone who’d served in the military like Mr. Braswell had, but I’d always thought that maybe his faculties weren’t what they once were. He was getting on up there in age—I think he was over ninety. Still, of all the people who’d lost pets over the last two weeks, he was the first person who’d actually claimed to’ve seen it happen. That reason alone was enough for me to feel he ought to at least be listened to. He said he’d called the police, and they’d come out and taken his statement. Mr. Braswell said he felt like they hadn’t really taken him seriously, though, that they’d just humored him. I didn’t know what to make of that. Like I said, he probably wasn’t as sharp as he once was, and the officers who’d come out might’ve thought that as well—but that didn’t mean he hadn’t seen what he’d seen.
That people’s pets were disappearing had long since become a serious area of concern for people in my town; but last night, the seriousness and the concern ratcheted up exponentially. A family two streets over from mine, the Carsons, had a nine-year-old boy named Tommy and a two-year-old poodle named Trixie. Just after supper, apparently as he often did, young Tommy took Trixie on a walk down to the end of their cul-de-sac. Neither one of them made it back home.
There were people along the route who’d said they’d seen them walking down the sidewalk like normal, nothing seeming the matter. No one had seen anything unusual, either—no strange vehicles or loiterers, and obviously no one had seen them abducted. They’d just vanished, as the cliché goes, without a trace.
Clearly, the disappearance of a child had changed things. Fear had come to settle over the community at large, and there was now a visual police presence—something seldom seen or felt in our little town. I’d heard that the mayor had called for the FBI, too, but I hadn’t seen any evidence of that. Tonight, though, as did all my neighbors, I went home and locked my doors.
I have a border collie named Jenna, and I’ve often thought how glad I was she couldn’t talk. If she could, she’d probably prove that she was smarter than I was, which would’ve been uncomfortable for both of us. But she couldn’t talk, so we went along playing the roles of master and pet. The point, though, is that she was a very smart dog, the smartest dog I’d ever been around.
It must’ve been sometime around midnight when Jenna woke me—it’d been a while since I’d let her out to go to the bathroom. I stumbled toward the backdoor, but then I remembered about everything that’d been going on. Still, I knew she had to pee, so in spite of the fact that there was a full moon, I grabbed a flashlight and took it out with us.
It didn’t take long for me to see it. Almost exactly as I’d imagined it when Mr. Braswell had described what he’d seen, there was a dark space just to the right of my patio, a space where the light just didn’t seem to go. It was larger than I’d imagined, though, maybe ten to fifteen feet square. I couldn’t tell for sure because it wasn’t static—it seemed to move, expand and contract, keeping me from getting a fix on it. I reflexively turned on my flashlight and shined it at the darkness, and the entire thing lit up, like someone had put a lit candle inside a paper bag.
I felt fear, but I felt awe as well, looking at this thing that didn’t appear to be from our world. I was mesmerized, and had sort of lost track of what was going on, only managing to wonder what this thing could possibly be. Jenna had been sitting on her haunches next to me, but by the time I came back to the moment, she had stood and walked several paces toward the thing. I moved the flashlight’s beam to her; she looked back at me over her shoulder when I yelled for her to get away, to come back to me, but then she just trotted forward and disappeared into the darkness.
I yelled something—I don’t remember what—but before I realized what I was doing, I’d started after her at a run. By the time I’d reached the thing’s perimeter, though, my innate fear had taken hold, and I had begun trying to stop my forward progress. It was too late, though. I at least partially crossed the thing’s edge, and what I saw… it was almost indescribable.
There was a vast landscape stretched before me, a desert landscape beneath a bright, silvery sky, and it felt nothing like being in the real world. Everything was fluid, like it was made from paper—or flames, maybe—and was being blown and stretched by a stiff wind. Even my own hands and arms appeared distorted in that same way as I looked down at them—it was disorienting. The landscape was mostly devoid of color as well. Everything appeared in varying shades of grays and whites, as though it was being washed out by the brightness of the light. There was a constant noise, too, like the rush of water or a steady wind, causing everything to sound and feel fuzzy.
I don’t know how long I was in that place—a second? A minute? A day? All I know is that I found myself tumbling onto my backside there on my patio, the dark thing still looming over me. I can’t say if I’d managed to lurch backward somehow or if the thing had simply expelled me, but I was out. Jenna, however, was still in.
Otherwise, everything seemed eerily calm and quiet; there was no wind, no leaves rustling in the trees, no animal noises at all, no sounds from any of my neighbors’ houses. It was like I was all alone, like that’s how the dark thing wanted me, and I could feel adrenaline beginning to pulse through my veins.
Probably out of fear, I switched my flashlight back on and shined it at the dark thing. As before, it lit up in a muted peach-colored glow. Also, there came a sound from it, a distant sound that seemed to move closer over time. Soon enough I could tell what the sound was. It was Jenna—she was barking from somewhere inside that vast landscape, the fiery, colorless desert I’d seen with my own eyes, somehow existing within this relatively small space in my backyard.
I felt a rush of excitement, or anxiety, or something. No matter. My dog was lost somewhere inside that thing, and I wanted her out. I rationalized that it would be foolish for me to go back in, because then we’d both be lost—just like the rest of the pets, and just like young Tommy. So, instead of venturing in, I called to her, loud as I could, over and over, and then I stopped to listen. Sure enough, before long I heard her reply. She was getting closer, too. I could tell from the sound that she was getting closer.
Probably from my excitement over her drawing nearer, I managed to move the beam from the dark thing. Naturally, the illumination went away—but so did Jenna’s barking. Somehow I knew—I knew right then and there that the light was the key; the beam of light was the portal into and out of the dark space. I hurriedly shone the light back at the thing. It lit back up, and I could once again hear Jenna.
I kept calling to her, over and over. She kept replying, sometimes seeming farther away, but sometimes closer. Finally, though, after what seemed a long time of calling, she sounded like she had to’ve been right next to the edge of the darkness, like she was just a few feet away from me. She wouldn’t come out, though; she wouldn’t cross over and come back into our world. Without really giving it much thought, I found myself moving back toward the darkness.
Once I got to the edge, I reached my hand in. How bizarre—to see your hand and arm disappear right in front of you. I reached around but could feel nothing. I kept calling to Jenna, though, and she kept barking. There came a point, however, when it sounded like she was moving away; so probably out of panic, I forced myself through the dark’s outer edge and reentered the fluid, colorless world. To my immense relief, standing right before me was Jenna, her reddish fur seemingly ablaze in the cosmic distortion.
I called to her, and she barked a reply, though I could scarcely hear either of us over the rushing sounds from this strange world. She ran to me, though. She ran and leapt toward my chest, and the next thing I knew, the both of us were tumbling on the grass of my backyard.
I scooped her up and gave her a big hug, and she replied with a multitude of licks across my face; but then, like we’d remembered at the same time, we looked toward the dark thing. It had moved; it was still moving, in fact, toward the back of my yard. I seemed to have lost my flashlight, so I couldn’t track it with light, but we watched. It moved down into the wooded gulch behind my fencerow, and then it ascended toward the sky and over my neighbor’s roof. Eventually it moved too far away for us to see, its shrinking profile blending into the night sky.
We went back inside, Jenna and I, and I was intending to call 9-1-1 straight away. I found my phone and started to dial, but something made me hesitate. What was I going to say? That my dog and I had been inside a dark blob that had appeared in my backyard? That it was actually a portal to another universe, and I’d somehow managed to save my dog from it? Was that my story?
It took me about two seconds to decide—of course it was my story. It’s what had happened. My guess was that this dark thing had been lurking around our town for the last several weeks and was responsible for all the disappearances. Would people think I was crazy, or that I was just trying to get attention? Sure, some would—but some wouldn’t. The way I figured it, if people knew what to look for, they’d be more likely to find it—or for some, to avoid it.
Either way, from my perspective it was imperative that the thing be found. I’m an animal lover, so that several dozen pets had disappeared these last few weeks would be enough reason for me, just as it would for a lot of my fellow townspeople—but there was a higher calling here. Tommy Carson was in that thing, or place, or whatever it was—I knew it in my bones—and if I could make it back with Jenna, Tommy Carson could be found and brought back as well.
Jenna was standing next to my chair, looking at me expectantly. I gave her head a quick rub, feeling immensely grateful that she was with me, that she was as smart as she was, and then pressed the send button on my phone."	9.62	13.0	WordDogger	11/30/2020
There’s Something Wrong With Dad	"Fifteen years ago, something terrible happened to my family. It’s taken a lot of therapy and drugs to help me cope with it. I still think about those days a lot. I can’t seem to get some of the images out of my mind. They scare me, they keep me up at night. I want to forget, but I can’t seem to.
My therapist told me I should write it all out. She said that it would help purge some of these memories. I’m not sure if I believe her, but I’m going to try. I have to. I need peace of mind. I can’t keep living like this.
A couple of things you need to know before I begin: First, my family didn’t believe in technology. We didn’t have a TV, a computer, a phone, anything. My dad believed those things would rot your brain out and he was always happy to tell people just that. And secondly, my family didn’t like to be bothered. Our house was out in the hills down a dirt road. We didn’t have neighbors. We didn’t have company. It was just us. My mom, my dad, and my brother Jay. My mom homeschooled us and my dad would take his truck into town to work at the bank.
I wouldn’t say we were an unhappy family. My mom, Ann, was caring, kind, and had a passive way of dealing with things. She was a soft-spoken, submissive woman. My brother Jay was two years younger than me. I loved my brother. He was a troublemaker and I constantly had to cover for him, hiding some of his more mischievous actions from our parents.
And then there was my father, Henry. He was an old fashion kind of man. Strict, but honest. He believed in a moral code, believed in being an upstanding example, and was a hard-working provider for our small family.
That was before everything went bad.
That was before my father changed.
I was sitting at the breakfast table happily munching my toast. My six-year-old brother sat across from me, slurping down his milk. My father walked into the kitchen and asked Jay to stop being so rude before going to my mother and pecking her on the cheek, bidding her good morning.
My mother smiled and helped him with his tie, telling him his lunch was packed for the day and to come home safe. My dad threw on his sports jacket and grabbed his briefcase from the kitchen counter. He ruffled my hair and leaned down next to me.
“Are you going to be good for your mom today, champ?” He asked. This close, I could smell his cologne, his face freshly shaved. He was a good looking man, tall and dark with broad shoulders. I had always looked up to him and admired his physicality.
“Yeah, Dad, I’ll be good,” I answered.
Smiling, my dad went to my brother and asked him the same. My brother shrugged his shoulders, a goofy grin on his face. One of his front teeth was loose and it stuck out at an angle, the object of much fruitless wiggling.
“Maybe today that’ll come out,” my dad said, examining it.
He kissed Jay on the forehead and said goodbye to my mother, blowing her a kiss, and was out the door. As I finished my toast, I heard him fire up the truck and back it down the gravel driveway.
My mother began cleaning up the breakfast dishes, telling Jay and I to finish up and fetch our school books. I hated school, as all children do. I thought it was boring and a waste of time. The woods and hills were more interesting to me than words and pencils.
Groaning, I brushed the crumbs from my shirt and motioned for Jay to come with me to our room to collect out school supplies.
The day passed like so many before it. Jay and I sat at the kitchen table, doing our school work, listening to our mother, and trying not to die of boredom. At lunch, my mother made us peanut butter sandwiches and we were allowed to go outside for an hour. This was always my favorite part of the school day.
Jay and I bound from our house and went to the woods. We climbed trees, threw rocks at each other, and then finally took turns rolling down the grassy hill we lived on. I remember how warm it was that day, the June heat foreshadowing an even hotter July.
We heard our mother calling us back in and we obeyed, steeling ourselves for the final stretch of school work. Hours seemed like years in that kitchen, but three o’clock always came. When the hands on the old clock made a right angle, we were allowed to close our books for the day.
That evening, Jay and I decided to make paper airplanes on the living room floor as my mother prepared supper. I remember the delicious smells wafting through the house as we folded newspaper into planes. Jay had just finished his first one, holding it up proudly, when dad came home.
From the second he walked into the door, I knew it was going to be a bad night. We all have those memories of our fathers, probably when his temper got the better of him and everyone was on eggshells. This was different though. There was an aura of tension around him that I had never seen before.
He didn’t say anything when he walked in, just tossed his coat over the back of a chair and put his briefcase down. My mother turned from the stove and smiled at him, welcoming him home and asking how his day was. Dad said nothing, just going to the sink and filling a glass of water. He drained it in one long gulp and set the glass down.
He turned to Jay and I, something hard and dark in his eyes.
“What are you doing?” he asked, his tone sharp.
“Look, Dad, it’s a B52 Bomber!” Jay said proudly, swooping his paper plane through the air.
My father took a step forward suddenly and snatched it from his hand, examining it. He lowered the plane and stared at us.  “Is this the paper I was reading this morning?”
I swallowed. Yep, Dad was in a bad mood.
“I told them they could use it.  I thought you were finished reading it,” my mother intervened.
My dad turned to her.  “Well, maybe you should ask me next time. Do you think you can handle that?”
My mom blinked.  “I’m sorry, honey. I didn’t think it was a big deal.”
My dad said nothing, just pulled a kitchen chair out and sat down, watching us. I felt uncomfortable. I felt like he was looking for an excuse to be angry. He wasn’t usually like this, but there had been a time or two his anger had gotten the better of him. For the most part, though, he wasn’t a violent or even a loud person.
“Bad day at the bank, dear?” my mother asked, stirring a pot full of sauce she was preparing.
My dad turned to look at her.  “I had the worst day I’ve ever had.” He shook his head.  “You can’t even imagine. None of you can. The things I go through to put food on this table.”
My mother turned and frowned, “Aw, I’m sorry to hear that. Can I get you a beer?”
Dad nodded.
My mom went to the fridge and pulled one out, handing it to him and putting a hand on my dad’s shoulder reassuringly.
My dad went to twist the top off, but pulled his hand away with a snarl.  “Ow! Shit! Of course, it’s not a twist top, why would it be!” I could see a drop of blood on my dad’s hand from where the cap had cut him. I began to look for an excuse to leave the room before dinner.
“Relax, dear, I’ll get you a bottle opener,” my mom said, trying to cool his rising temper.
My dad shook his head, “Oh, don’t bother!” Raising his arm, he smashed the neck of the beer against the table and shattered it. He poured the beer from the fragmented neck into a glass before tossing the empty bottle towards the trash can. It missed and shattered on the floor.
“Henry!” my mom said, her voice a soft hiss.
My dad took a long pull and set the glass down hard on the table.  “Maybe next time you should get the twist-off caps. Maybe you should think about me every once in a while.”
Not wanting to fight, my mom quietly turned around and continued making dinner. My dad took another drink from the glass and looked at Jay and I. I quickly looked down at my half-made paper plane and mindlessly fiddled with it. I didn’t want him to even know I existed right now.
“Tommy,” my dad called me. My heart froze. I looked up at him, panicked.
“Were you good today?” he asked. “Was Tommy a good boy for mommy?” His voice was condescending and his eyes bore into mine.
I nodded.
He drained the rest of his beer, staring at me, before putting it down and muttering.  “You better have been.”
As my brother and I tried to melt into the floor, my dad stood and went to the bedroom to get changed out of his work clothes. I let out a sigh of relief and looked at Jay. He grimaced at me and shook his head, his loose tooth jutting from his upper lip.
“Be good tonight,” I whispered urgently to him.
I picked up my plane and decided to stash it in my bedroom. I didn’t want to give my dad any excuse to flip out tonight. Out of sight, out of mind.
As I walked down the hallway towards my bedroom, I passed my parents room. I glanced inside and saw my dad.
He was standing by the bed, shirtless and facing the door. For a split second, I froze, expecting him to bark at me for something. But then I saw he had his hands over his eyes, his elbows jutting away from his body. He didn’t move a muscle, just stood like that silently, like he had been turned to stone.
I didn’t know what to make of it, the odd display unnerving me. I didn’t stick around to find out what he was doing and quickly scooted down the hall to my room. I deposited my plane on my dresser just as I heard my mom call everyone for supper.
Jay and I trot to the table as my mom placed a steaming bowl of hot spaghetti on it, smelling of garlic and basil. Jay rubbed his stomach and swooned, expressing to mom how hungry he was. I took my place at the table next to him as my father entered the kitchen.
Wordlessly, he took a seat at the head of the table, opposite my mother who shot him a cautious glance.
He folded his hands and turned to me, “Why don’t you say grace for us tonight, Tommy?”
I nodded and closed my eyes, locking my fingers together.  “Dear Jesus, thank-”
I jumped as my dad slammed his hand down on the table. Jay let out a little squeak and my mom visibly flinched.
My dad leaned towards me.  “Now Tommy, how do you expect Jesus to hear you when you talk so softly? Start over, but louder.”
My heart was thundering in my chest and it took conscious effort to keep my voice from shaking. My father’s outburst was so sudden and out of character for him that I didn’t know how to respond.
I lowered my head and began again, “Dear Jesus, thank you for the food and thank you for mom who made it.” After a pause I added, “And thank you for dad who goes to work for it. Amen.”
My mom echoed my “amen” and told me that was a nice prayer. Jay was staring at my dad, unease blooming in his eyes.
Dad looked at the bowl of spaghetti and I saw his jaw clench.  “This again. I guess it’s not your fault, Ann, that you can’t cook anything but noodles. It’s not like your family had the money to send you to college to make something of yourself.”
My mom looked up at him, shock rippling across her face. My dad met her stare, his face carved from stone. He was daring her to say something to him, anything. Wisely, my mom lowered her eyes and began spooning out the steaming spaghetti.
Jay immediately dug into his, twirling his fork around the sauced noodles and shoving them hungrily into his mouth. I winced as he slurped down a mouthful, causing the red gravy to squirt from his lips.
My dad turned to him, his eyes ice.  “Jay. What have I told you about being rude at the table?”
Jay froze, fork halfway to his mouth, “U-uh…” he stuttered, mind blanking.
My dad curled a finger at him, “Come here. Now.”
I felt my heart sink into my guts and turn to rot. I was breathing heavily, not wanting my brother to be in any kind of trouble. I watched as he slid from his chair, fear in his eyes.
“Bring me your plate,” he said in that same iron voice.
Jay turned and took his plate, slowly walking it over to stand in front of my dad. My father looked him over, shaking his head, his mouth twisting into a grimace.
“I didn’t raise a pig,” he said darkly, “But if you insist on being one, you’re going to eat like one.”
He suddenly grabbed Jay’s plate and threw it on the floor, shattering it and spraying spaghetti everywhere. I jumped in my seat again, forcing my eyes away and praying I’d disappear. My mom gasped and her mouth fell open.
My dad pointed to the floor, “Go ahead, son.  If you’re so desperate to be a barnyard animal, you can eat like one!”
Jay looked at my mom and I could tell he was on the brink of crying, unsure what to do, begging someone for help.
“Henry, don’t you think you’re overreacting a little bit?” my mom ventured timidly.
My dad slammed his hands down again, his voice rising.  “Ann, if you don’t raise these kids to be-gggungrate-hate it when the wind blows north!”
Everyone paused. I chanced a glance at my dad. What? It sounded like he had switched sentences midway through. My mom said nothing, waiting for her husband to continue. Jay sniffled beside me and I reached out a hand and took his, squeezing it gently.
My dad blinked and one of his eyes rolled up into his head and then righted itself. It happened so fast I almost didn’t see it. He cleared his throat and gave his head a quick shake.
My father blinked a few more times and then looked at me and Jay. He saw me holding his hand, Jay on the brink of tears.
“Tommy, let go of your brother’s hand,” he said, his eye twitching slightly.
I obeyed, our sweaty palms separating. I watched my father, food forgotten, my throat dry and mouth parched. I didn’t understand why he was acting like this. I had never seen him this hostile towards us. I knew that sometimes when he had a bad day at work he came home frustrated… but never like this.
What had happened today?
My father looked at me in my seat, waving Jay to sit back down.  “Tommy, your brother was being punished. Do you know why I punish you boys? It’s so that you understand right from wrong. Now, I just saw you trying to comfort your brother.” He leaned toward me, his breath hot.  “That tells me that you’re on his side. That tells me you think it’s okay to act like a pig at my table.”
I shook my head frantically, “N-no, I just wanted-”
My dad cut me off with a wave of his hand.  “Stop. I don’t want to have to punish you for lying as well.”
He patted the table top.  “Put your hand on the table.”
I shot my mom a terrified look, begging her for help. Her eyes were wide and her face pale. She didn’t know how to react, had never seen her husband so cruel or sharp with us. She was speechless, afraid that saying something would antagonize my dad further.
“On the table,” my dad repeated, his voice hardening.
Hand shaking, I placed it on the table, palm down. Jay had started to cry next to me, tears dripping from his cheeks.
My dad picked up his fork.
“Henry,” my mom whispered, eyes wide.
I looked at my dad, fighting back my own tears, fear choking me.
My father gripped the fork.  “You need to understand that-”  He stopped suddenly, coughing hard, and then gasped in a dry voice.  “Don’t you hate the wind in the north?!”
He dropped the fork on the table and his mouth fell open, his tongue stretching to his chin. His eye began to twitch rapidly and he rubbed it viciously, closing his mouth and gritting his teeth.
None of us moved, paralyzed by the odd display. I had no idea what he was talking about or why he was acting like this. Something was wrong with him, that much was clear.
After a few seconds, my dad lowered his hand from his face and smiled at all of us.  “I think you boys understand now. Remember what I said, and we won’t have to do that again, okay?”
Jay and I nodded vigorously, desperate to get away from the tension, the table, all of this. I felt like I was stuck in some alternate reality, a nightmare I was just waiting to wake from.
My dad pointed to the floor.  “Tommy, could you please clean up that mess?”
As I scrambled to comply, he turned his eyes to my mother, looking her up and down where she sat. He began to twirl a spoon in his hand and got a strange look in his eye. It was as if he was evaluating her as a person, taking in all her physical features.
As I was scraping globs of spaghetti into the trash, I heard my father say, “Jay, can you go around to the back of the house and get me a brick?” I heard my brother get up and open the side door to the outside, the hinges creaking in their familiar way.
“Henry, what’s wrong?” I heard my mom ask in a hushed voice. Even as I sponged up the mess, I could hear the fear in her voice.
My dad didn’t respond. I finished wiping sauce from the floor just as Jay shuffled back into the house. He held a brick in his hands, dirt staining his fingers. With downcast eyes he brought it to my father and placed it on the table next to him.
My dad turned to the both of us, his voice cold steel.  “Now, both of you go to your room for the night. I’m going to fuck your mother.”
I heard my mom gasp as Jay and I turned away. I took my brother’s hand in mine, heart racing. I was terrified. I rarely heard my dad use that kind of language before and never in such an abrasive manner. As we quickly walked to our room, I looked at Jay and saw his face was a mess of snot, drool, and tear-streaked terror. His eyes were wet and wide with confusion. He didn’t understand any of this, didn’t understand why his father was being so mean to him. I didn’t either and so I gave his hand a little squeeze, unsure what else to do.
We closed the door to our bedroom and stared at each other. We could hear our dad yelling loudly in the kitchen, his voice rising. Jay covered his ears and ran to his bed, collapsing into his pillow. I went to him and put a hand on his back as he cried, his sobs muffled in the cotton.
Then I heard my mom start to scream.
I felt tears spill from my eyes and I began to hyperventilate, each breath a desperate attempt for oxygen. I covered my ears and squeezed my eyes shut as something crashed to the floor in the kitchen. More banging followed, and all the while my mother continued to shriek, her voice rising to an inhuman level. There was agony in her cries along with fear, and I kept waiting for her to stop.
But she didn’t.
It kept going.
And going.
And going.
And going.
Jay was weeping now, shaking his head into his pillow, trying to block out the sound. His whole body was shaking and it sounded like he was having trouble breathing. I laid down next to him and clutched his body to mine, my own tears spilling into his hair. I didn’t know what to do, didn’t know when this horrible nightmare would end.
I heard another crash as something shattered in the kitchen. I heard my mother howling and the screech of table legs on the hardwood floor. I heard Jay praying to God, his voice trembling. I clutched him tighter, realizing that I was sobbing as well. My whole body felt like it was a quivering mass of jello, my muscles weak and useless. I was more terrified than I had ever been in my life.
Finally, my mother stopped screaming. A soft hush fell over the house. I didn’t hear anything except the blood pumping in my ears. Jay had quieted to a series of soft sniffles, his face still buried in the pillow. I looked up from the bed, staring at the closed bedroom door. I begged it to remain shut.
I heard movement in the house, footsteps that came down the hall and stopped on the other side of the wall, in my parents bedroom. I heard shuffling and then a door shut. I waited. I prayed.
Jay shifted next to me and I told him to be quiet, wiping tears from his face and holding him close. More footsteps in the house, heavy slow paces. I thought for sure my mom was dead. People didn’t scream like that and live.
Our bedroom door opened.
Jay let out a little scream and shrunk into me as my dad entered.
He was crawling on all fours, his mouth hanging open, drool running down his chin, his eyes rolled back into his head. He shuffled side to side across the floor, slowly opening and closing his mouth, spittle leaking from his face. He was blinking rapidly, one of his eyes rolling forward to stare at us.
After a few seconds, he coughed, hacking up phlegm. Growling, he wiped his lips and stood, looking down at us cowering on the bed.
“Come with me,” he said, his voice a low rattle in his chest.
I didn’t move. Jay shrunk further against me. I could feel his body shaking against mine, sweat beading on his skin.
My dad took a step towards us, “Get up, both of you, right now.”
“Where’s mom?” I asked, voice trembling.
He was standing in front of us now.  “She’s resting. She’s had a long day. Now get up.”
Jay shifted against me and then he was sliding to the floor. Without much choice, I followed his example. My dad placed a hand on each of our shoulders and guided us towards the door. As we were directed through the house, I listened for my mother. What had he done to her? Where was she? Was she dead in the bedroom? I didn’t hear anything, no clues as to her condition or where she was.
We entered the kitchen and I saw that the table was pressed against the cabinets and a few of the dinner glasses lay shattered on the floor. I expected to see blood smeared across the floor or dripping down the surfaces, but there was none.
At least, that was until I saw the brick.
It had been placed on the counter by the sink. Half of it was soaked with thick, oozing blood.
When I saw it, I felt my body tense up. My dad must have felt the change in my stance because his grip tightened on my shoulder. Jay was sniffling beside me, his eyes cast down, refusing to look up and potentially see the horrors my father had bestowed on my mother.
My dad pushed us through the side door, outside. The night air was humid and sticky on the skin. A fat yellow moon hung in the sky like an out of place Christmas ornament. Stars twinkled across the black canvas and my ears were filled with the sound of chirping night critters. Contrary to inside, everything felt alive out here, pulsing in unison to the night’s dark heartbeat.
We were led around to the back of the house, towards our old shed. My dad didn’t keep much out there, just a few tools and the rickety lawn mower, both of which weren’t used much throughout the year. I didn’t like the shed, something about it always haunted me. At night, as I lay in bed, I would imagine some creature hiding inside, waiting until I fell asleep before emerging and creeping into my room to watch me.
Jay and I jerked to a halt as my dad squeezed our shoulders.
“Wait here,” he said, his voice sounding far away and strange. I glanced over my shoulder and saw he was rubbing his eyes.
“I want to go back in.  I want mom!” Jay sobbed, wiping his nose with the back of his hand.
“You can go in when – came up and traveled in the wind,” my dad said, his sentence fracturing into two nonsensical statements. He coughed hard and stuck his tongue out like he had a bad taste on it. I saw a shudder wrack his body and he looked like he was about to gag. He gained control of himself with a quick shake of his head, closing his mouth so hard his teeth clicked together.
I watched as he came around us and walked towards the shed. He looked back, making sure we were obeying, and then went inside. Jay looked at me, his eyes full of fear. He expected me to have some kind of explanation, an answer to the madness that surrounded us. I couldn’t summon the words to comfort him, didn’t know what combination of soothing syllables I could possibly string together to calm his terror.
“What is he going to do to us?” he whispered, the warm moonlight shining in his eyes.
“It’s going to be okay,” I said softly, the words tasting like a lie.
We heard movement from the shed, our father’s actions hidden behind the closed door. A warm breeze stirred the distant trees and the night was filled with the sound of rustling leaves. My hair danced across my forehead in the wind and I begged to blow away with it. Jay and I remained frozen in place, neither of us knowing which would be worse: facing whatever my father was preparing or running away and facing the wrath that came after. It’s not like we had anywhere to run; where could we possibly go? Who could we flee to? Our minds were trapped inside our youth, doomed to the almighty authority of our father.
The shed door opened, snapping me out of my thoughts. My dad stepped back into the night, his figure draped in shadows and dark moonlight.
“Both of you, get inside,” he ordered.
Jay grasped my arm as we shuffled forward, our father stepping aside to let us pass. The smell of rotting wood and old grass assaulted my senses and I rubbed my hand across my nose, trying to scrub the stench away. My dad had illuminated the cramped space with an old electric lantern. It sat on the workbench on the right, our small lawnmower catching the light on its dull metal surface. Tools piled around the lantern, an array of rusted hammers, screwdrivers, and pliers. I couldn’t remember the last time my dad had actually used any of them.
But all of that was seen with a passing glance. That wasn’t what held my attention. Something else did, my eyes drawn to it like fire and gasoline. Jay’s fingernails dug into my skin as he saw it too, his breath catching in his lungs.
A noose hung from the crossbeam, dangling down into the empty space. The rope was knotted tight, the twisting cords more menacing than anything on the workbench.
My dad entered behind us, shutting the door .
He went and stood by the noose, motioning me forward, “Come on now, Tommy, let’s get this over with.”
“D-dad,” I croaked, mouth dry and voice cracking like a dead twig, “w-what are you going to d-do?” My heart was pressed against my ribs, throwing itself against bone, a wild beast in my chest.
Dad traced the hanging loop with his fingers, “You’re going to be my windchime, son. I need to know when the wind will blow north. I think you’ll make a good chime, once I empty your insides out. But I’ll do that after.”
“Why are you doing this, daddy?” Jay cried, wet tears rolling down his cheeks.
He didn’t answer, just waited for me to go to him. I didn’t move, didn’t know what to do. Was he serious about going through with this? He couldn’t be, this was my father! He loved me, he would never do anything to seriously hurt me.
At that age, blind trust is a dangerous thing. It filled me, the memories and kindness my dad had shown me over the years. I trusted him. He was my father. But that darkness in his eye, that black spark, it terrified me. Reality and faith collided together in my mind like oil and water, the mixture turning my stomach in sick horror.
My father gripped the hanging rope.  “If you don’t come over here right now, I’m going to use Jay instead.”
I felt my brother bury his face into my side, weeping “no, no, no, no, no” over and over again, his tears damp on my shirt. I wrapped an arm around his head, feeling his sweaty hair brush over my skin. My heart was audible in my ears, my lips cracked and dry, breath coming in stuttering heaves.
“D-dad,” I cried, feeling myself begin to cry.  “Dad, I don’t want to. Please, Dad…”  My face was flushed as the fear came bubbling out of my face in wet streaks.
My father suddenly reached out and grabbed me, gripping my arm and yanking me towards the rope. I let out a cry and fell towards him, his hands hard and strong. He pushed and shoved me, positioning me under the rope, its shadow a dark halo over my head.
Jay was screaming openly, his face red and terrified. He just stood there, helpless, as my father pulled the noose down and slid it over my head.
Dad’s going to hang me.
The thought hit me like a knife to the heart. My knees were weak and knocked together, my whole body trembling in horrific anticipation. The rope around my neck scratched and rubbed against my skin, course and itchy. This was really about to happen. Up until this point, I didn’t believe my father was capable of such sins, especially to his own son. My dad was my hero, a strong supportive pillar and example to my brother and I.
And now I waited with baited breath for him to kill me.
“Here we go,” Dad said, positioning himself behind me and grabbing the dangling end of the rope that hung from the cross beam.
I heard a tightening of cords, the rope stretching and straining.
Suddenly my throat was clamped with hot fire, a burning agony that cut up into my chin as I was lifted off my feet. I kicked my legs frantically, impossibly helpless, my hands grabbing at my neck.
I couldn’t get my fingers between the rope and my skin, the tension denying any space to dig my nails into.
My head swelled and I felt the blood in my face ready to pop out of my eyes and mouth. I hacked and coughed, horrible gagging retches exploding from my lips as I tried to breath. My vision began to swim and colors began to blend.
I felt myself dying.
Suddenly, the pain was gone, the halo of fire around my throat vanishing. I felt my knees hit the hard floor and I crumpled into myself. I sucked in deep lungfuls of air, the oxygen never tasting any sweeter in my life.
As the world began to focus again, I realized my father was screaming. I blinked back the dizziness and focused my eyes, pushing the shadows away.
My father was against the back wall, clutching his side and howling as blood bubbled from his shirt. Jay stood next to him, weeping, screaming, his right arm soaked with blood up to his elbow.
He was holding a rusty box cutter, its blade dripping.
“Don’t hurt Tommy!” Jay was howling through wet eyes, “Don’t hurt him, Dad!”
Hand pressed to his side, my dad swiped at Jay, trying to snatch the box cutter. Jay jerked back and almost tripped over himself, letting out another shriek.
“Look what you did to me!”  My dad grimaced, pulling his hand away and revealing a deep gash in his side, his shirt tattered and red.
I struggled to my feet, reaching out and pulling Jay towards me. I took the box cutter from him and put a hand on my throbbing head.
“I’m okay, it’s going to be okay,” I tried to reassure him.
Suddenly my dad lunged for me, pushing himself off the wall using his back. Without thinking, I slashed at him, a purely defensive reaction.
Time seemed to slow as I watched the blade catch my dad in the arm, the blade eating into his skin. It cut through the flesh like soft butter, parting his wrist like a bloody zipper. Blood squirted into my eyes and I heard my dad scream, pulling his arm back and cradling it on his chest.
He slumped to the floor, his face pale and full of fury. He was breathing hard and I could tell it wouldn’t be long before he steadied himself and was at us again.
I grabbed Jay and ran from the shed, the night behind us filling with howls of rage.
As the air hit our tear stained faces, I suddenly noticed trucks roaring down the road and up our driveway. They were bulky and loud, the diesel engines growling towards us. Blinding white lights cut paths through the night, shining across my bloody face as two, three, then four of them stopped in front of our house.
They were camouflaged. Even at that age, I knew they were military.
What is going on? my exhausted, terrified mind asked.
I pulled Jay close to me and advanced on them, unsure what they were doing here, but desperately needing of help.
Two men emerged from a white van, dressed in hazmat suits. They sent a shiver of fear coursing through me as they charged Jay and I, yelling and waving their arms. I froze in the yard, Jay trembling beside me.
Men in uniform poured from the other vehicles, guns drawn, all pointing at us. They all had gas masks on and it gave them a chilling, inhuman look in the moonlight.
Everyone was shouting as the men in the hazmat suits approached Jay and myself. I back up a step as they got close, gripping the box cutter in my bloody hand. I didn’t know who these people where or why they were pointing guns at us. I needed to protect Jay. He had been through enough, we both had.
“It’s okay, kid!  It’s okay!” one of the men in the suits said, raising his hands. The other one had a pistol drawn, scanning the yard.
“Where is he?” the one with the pistol asked.
I stammered, mind blanking in fear and confusion.
“Your dad!  Where’s your dad, kid?” the first one asked. Through the suit I could see blue eyes reflecting back at me.
“He’s in there!” Jay cried suddenly, pointing to the shed.  “He wanted to hurt Tommy, so I cut him! I had to! I’m sorry, I didn’t want Tommy to die!”
The first one looked at the one with the pistol and gave a quick nod. I watched as he trotted over to the shed and peeked inside. He looked back and gave the three of us a wave and then a thumbs up to the men in gas masks.
Then he entered the shed.
And I heard him kill my father.
The gunshot exploded in the night and I jumped, the finality of it deafening.
I stood there, dumbfounded, bloody, confused and terrified. I didn’t know who these men were, what they were doing here, or why they had just shot my dad. I clutched Jay to my side, who was staring up at me with giant round eyes.
“Did… did that man just kill Dad?” he asked, his voice a shaky whisper.
The man in the hazmat suit shook his head.  “Son, you don’t have anything to worry about. It’s going to be okay now. He won’t try to hurt you anymore.”
Someone was yelling behind him and I glanced over his shoulder to see that the men in masks had gone into our house. One of them was calling for a medic, frantically waving his hand to get inside.
My mother. I prayed she was okay, that these men could help her. I didn’t know what my father had done to her, but I remembered the screams.
“W-what… what is going on?” I whispered as I watched the man with the pistol exit the shed. He was yelling towards the soldiers, asking for something, my ears not registering his calls. My world was crashing down around me in inky patches of disbelief and shock.
The man knelt down in front of us, placing a hand on each of our shoulders, “Boys, I really shouldn’t be the one to tell you this, especially not right now.”
I looked at him with moist eyes.  “My dad just tried to hang me…please…”
I could see shock ripple across his eyes through the hazmat visor. He looked at both of us, struggling with himself.
“Please,” I begged, desperate to make any kind of sense of the madness.
The man sighed.  “Boys… something horrible happened today. I really don’t think I should be the one to tell you… but…” He looked at us again.  “Boys, something bad happened by the bank where your dad worked. There was some kind of earthquake. Very minor, but it cut a deep gash in the Earth. It opened up a pocket of… something… that we’ve never seen before. Some kind of gas. The wind carried it towards town and…” He looked to the ground, shaking his head.  “It killed a lot of people. A lot of people. We’re trying to contain it, keep whatever it is from spreading.”
“Is that why you shot Dad?” Jay asked quietly, sniffling and rubbing his nose. “‘Cause he had got the bad wind on him?”
The man looked up at both of us, his eyes fearful.  “Boys…your Dad died this morning along with everyone else at the bank. We took his body to containment. They’re performing an autopsy on him as we speak. I’m really sorry.  Damn it, I am.”
I felt my brain bend back on itself, a mess of knotted thoughts and emotions, the words hitting me like bullets. What was this man talking about? Dad died this morning? That wasn’t possible.  He came home from work, just like every other day. My dad’s corpse was lying in the shed. This man was lying, he had to be.
“Then who’s… who’s in there?” I finally asked, the question coming out in a weak dribble.
The man shook his head.  “Son, whatever is lying dead in that shed… it isn’t your father. You see… something else came out of the Earth this morning. Something other than the poisonous gas. Something that crawled up to the surface and got out. Something that, for whatever reason, took the form of your father and drove home to you all. Witnesses saw him – it – leaving, the only one to get out. When we found your dad’s body, we didn’t know what to make of it. We still don’t. That thing in there,” he said, pointing to the shed, “we don’t know what it is or what it was trying to do. But that is not your father.” He shook his head.  “Shit, I’m really sorry, kids.  I really shouldn’t be telling you all this. I’m sorry about your dad, I really am.” He stood up.  “Come on, we need to get you to a hospital and have you checked out. It’s going to be okay, I promise.”
I barely heard him as Jay and I were led to the trucks. I saw men carrying my mother out of the house on a stretcher. She was alive and barely conscious, but when she saw us she reached out and called our names.
Jay started crying again and sprinted to her. I wanted to as well, but found I didn’t have the strength.
Everything the man had told me twisted and coiled around my mind. None of it made sense. None of it could possibly be real. It couldn’t be. How could my entire life change so drastically in one night? What was going to happen to us now? Where were they taking us? Were we going to be okay? At the time, I didn’t know.
I felt someone grasp something out of my hand and I realized one of the soldiers was trying to pry the box cutter out of my grip. I let go, the rusty metal peeling away from my palm, blood staining it in sticky red splotches.
What had happened tonight?
I looked back and saw the men in hazmat suits pulling my dad’s dead body from the shed and zipping it up in a clear plastic body bag.
A final thought ripped through the madness.
What the hell is that thing?"	8.67	18.0	Elias Witherow	11/13/2020
The Old Horns	"When you have been a priest for as long as I have, you start to notice patterns in people. When a parishioner approaches, I can already guess what they want to ask me by their body language or the way their eyes flicker to meet mine. It’s quite funny actually. Everyone thinks they’re unique, that somehow they’re different than everyone else.
Well let me tell you, after 38 years of hearing confessions, I’ve come to the conclusion that we’re all pretty much identical. If I have to listen to one more trembling voice confess to watching pornography, I just might lose my mind. I haven’t turned cynical in my old age, just weary. When you hear the same sins repeated over and over again, a thousand million times over, you begin to wonder if there’s any hope left for the human race. I guess that’s where faith kicks in.
Though now…now I’m not sure how much of that faith I still possess. You see, I don’t practice anymore. I’ve given up the collar. I witnessed something that has shaken me to this day and the shadow of its memory still haunts me.
It was the last confession I ever did.
I stifled a yawn, trying my best to remain awake as another sobbing parishioner left the confessional. The whole process had just become so mechanical to me that I barely even heard what was being whispered on the other side of the screen.
I adjusted the cushion under my rear, feeling the familiar ache that had only gotten worse as my years advanced. I checked my watch and saw I still had another twenty minutes to go. I closed my eyes and offered it up to the Lord, begging him to fill me with patience for these people.
I heard the familiar creak of wood on the other side of the screen as yet another sinner took their place. I ran a hand over my weary eyes and then spoke into the screen.
“In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,” I recited, making the sign of the cross.
A male voice whispered to me from the other side, “Forgive me Father for I have sinned. This is my first confession.”
I shifted the cushion beneath me, annoyed at the distraction, and tried my best to focus on the man, “Do not be afraid my son, tell the Lord what you have done.”
The man said nothing for a moment, his voice rasping behind the screen, “Father…I don’t think there’s any hope for me. I’ve done so much…”
I sat up a little straighter, “My son, there is no sin too great for God.”
The man struggled to keep his emotions in check, his voice straining, “I think I’ve broken every rule in the book. Murder…deception…lust…”
The mention of murder sent a cold icicle shooting up my back, “You killed someone?” I asked, voice hardening. This was a serious confession, one I had never heard before in all my years in the booth.
I could hear the man begin to fall apart, shame and grief washing his words in sorrow, “I’ve killed so many people…”
My heart was racing in my chest, “Who have you killed? When was this?”
The man sniffled, “It was a long time ago. I’ve been on the run for so long. I don’t know what to do anymore. My whole life is a lie, one big fake advertisement for something I’m not.”
I leaned into the screen, voice stern, “Have you thought about turning yourself into the police? Coming clean will surely ease the weight of your sins. I can hear it in your voice…you’re suffering.”
The man started crying, “You have no idea…”
I knew I had to be delicate here, “Son, the Lord’s love is endless, he can forgive you these transgressions if you show him how truly sorry you are.”
The man surprised me by barking a laugh, “His love is not endless.”
I swallowed, treading carefully, “I know it’s hard to understand, to accept, especially when you’re feeling so low. But hear me: nothing is too great for the Lord. His wisdom and love for you are deeper than the oceans, broader than the universe, and he wants you to know that, to feel that in your soul.”
The man was recovering and he snorted behind the screen, “You couldn’t be more wrong.”
Slightly frustrated, I pressed him, “What makes you say that?”
Suddenly, the man’s voice filled the entire booth, a deep rumble that shook me to the very core of my soul.
“Because I am your Lord.”
I blinked, my head spinning. This was new. Just what kind of person was I dealing with here? I suddenly realized that the mental state of this person could be seriously compromised.
After a moment, I decided to play along a little longer, “You’re…the Lord.”
“I can hear your doubt.”
I sniffed, “Well, forgive me if I’m a little cautious around someone who proclaims they’re the Son of God.”
“There is no Son of God,” the man said, irritated, “Just me. You guys made up all that Jesus bullshit. I had nothing to do with that.”
My mind was spinning as I tried to keep up, “Ok, so who are you really? And what are you doing in my confessional?”
The man exhaled, “I just told you who I am. And I’m here to make peace before I die…or whatever happens to me afterwards…I don’t really know how I die…I never thought about it before.”
I decided it was time to start steering the ship back on course, “When a soul dies in the good graces of God, it gets sent to Heaven.”
The man laughed, “No, no, no, you’re wrong, you’re all wrong.”
“What are you talking about?” I asked feeling anger begin to stir in my chest.
The man’s voice dropped low, “Heaven is fucking gone.”
I cocked an eyebrow, the seriousness in his voice giving me pause, “What do you mean, gone?” His tone remained the same, a low rumble, “It got wiped out a long time ago. There’s nothing left.”
For reasons unexplainable, I began to feel uneasy, a sinking dread that was just beginning to form in my stomach.
“How is that possible? God is almighty, the Devil can never best him,” I said.
The man slammed his hand against the wall, causing me to jump, “THERE IS NO DEVIL! There never was! I don’t know where you people got that, but it wasn’t from me. There is just myself and Heaven. No angels, no saints, nothing. I created a place for you and I created a place for me. Then I sat around and watched my creations, all from the comfort of my home. My Heaven. Every once in awhile I’d poke my finger in and stir up some shit. Cause a disaster or something, just to see how you’d react.”
“If Heaven is gone…where do our souls go when we die?” I asked.
“I have no idea!” The man said, “I don’t even know if you have a soul! I certainly didn’t give you one. Why would I? I made you so I could have something to do. When you die, three more people take your place and I watch the circus go round and round. I have to say, I’m impressed with the human race. You all have really come a long way. I never dreamed you’d create such wonders.”
Something outside the booth, in the sanctuary, crashed, but I ignored it, the man drawing all my attention.
“Why…why are you here?” I repeated, mind blanking at the absurdity of what I was hearing. The man’s voice turned quiet, an edge of unease now, “Because I’m going to die soon. I can’t hide down here much longer. They know where I am. They’re getting so close.”
“Who?”
The man collected himself before whispering, “The Old Horns.”
I could hear the shuffling of feet echoing outside the booth as people began to leave, probably annoyed at the long confessional, but I didn’t care.
Something about this man held me…and terrified me.
“I’m not following,” I said, a worm of unease snaking up my stomach into my chest, “I thought you said there was just you and us. I thought you said the devil didn’t exist?”
“He doesn’t,” the man hissed, “This is something else entirely. I have no idea what they are or where they came from.”
The logical part of me begged to end this conversation, but I couldn’t let it go. “What do they want with you? The Old Horns?”
Fear entered the man’s voice, “I don’t know. They just showed up in Heaven one day, taking me completely by surprise.  They destroyed everything. Their power and wrath were more furious than anything I have ever seen before. I had no choice, I ran.”
“You ran…and came to Earth?” I asked.
“I had to!” he said, “Where else is there to go? I don’t know anywhere else but your world and mine! I have no clue where these entities came from or how they found me. But there’s no stopping them…they’ll be here soon…I can’t hide forever.”
I exhaled, trying to collect my thoughts, “Ok, so say hypothetically this is all true…why would you come here? To confession? If you’re God, what do you need to apologize for?”
The man was silent for a moment, and then said softly, “Isn’t this what you’re supposed to do before you die? Truth be told, I have no idea what will happen to me when they catch up. But I’m scared. I’m really, really scared. I’ve done a lot of bad things…and…and this just seemed like the right thing to do,” he trailed off miserably. “I’m not the all-loving, wonderful God humanity thinks I am. I’ve done things to you people that sicken me. I don’t know why I did them, but I did. You can look back on history and probably pick out the events I had a hand in. They’re pretty obvious. You know how people always say, ‘Why would God let that happen?’  Well, it’s because I’m an asshole. And I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all the shit I’ve made you people go through. You didn’t deserve it. I kept pushing the envelope and you Christians never lost faith in me. You would find ways to make sense of it all, always giving me the glory. Shit, I’m so sorry…”
I didn’t say anything, the weight of his words collapsing in on me like the walls of a cave, trapping me in their conviction. How could I believe any of this? It was nonsense…and yet…
Another crash echoed in the sanctuary and this time, I took notice because it filled the silence.
“Oh no,” I heard the man whisper, fear stirring his voice.
“What’s wrong?” I asked quietly.
I heard the shuffle of a curtain and then the creak of wood, “They’re here.”
I swallowed hard, “Who?”
“The Old Horns.”
Something dropped into the pit of my stomach, and I was suddenly very on edge. I leaned forward, one hand resting on the curtain in front of me.
“Don’t open it. Do not look at them,” The man hissed.
“Why?” I whispered, my voice unsteady now.
“Just…don’t!” he said urgently, “My time here is done. I’m at the end of my road. Stay in your booth until you hear silence again. It will be safe then.”
“This is insane,” I whispered, “There’s nothing out there.”
The man leaned into the screen, his voice earnest, “I know I have no right to ask you of this…but please…have faith in me one last time.”
My hand remained frozen, my sweaty fingers plastered to the curtain. I was paralyzed, torn between the madness of his story and the horrific sinking feeling I felt in my chest.
“Please,” the man begged now, “absolve me of my sins and I’ll leave you all alone, forever.”
Voice shaking, mind spinning, I released the curtain and turned to the screen. Something moved outside the booth, a scraping sound across the marble floors.
I made the sign of the cross, voice trembling, “I absolve you of your sins, go in peace.”
The man exhaled heavily, relief filling him, “Thank you, Father. Thank you.”
Suddenly, a noise blasted through the church, so loud I had to cover my ears, my heart leaping into my throat.
It was the blast of a low horn, a long single note that rattled me to the bone.
As the sound faded, a drop of sweat ran down my face. What in the hell…
“It’s time,” the man said.
“Wait!” I cried, pressing my face against the screen, “Don’t go out there. Please!”
The man’s voice softened, “Maybe this is how it was supposed to be. I never sent someone to die on a cross for your sins. But I do love you. I love all of you. And I can’t thank you enough for keeping me company all these years. You truly are an incredible people. God bless, Father.”
And then I heard the curtain rustle as he stepped out into the sanctuary. His footsteps echoed away from me and I slammed my hands over my ears again as another horn sounded. My breath blew sour across my tongue and I sat panting, waiting, sweat rolling down my spine. I heard the man speaking to something, but I couldn’t understand him, his voice muffled. My hands clenched my pants, and every part of me screamed to look.
But I resisted, teeth grinding together as I squeezed my eyes shut.
I began to count in my head, desperately needing to focus on something.
One…two…three…four…
Another ear-splitting horn sounded off, the low note so loud I heard the confessional booth creak against the blast.
…five…six…seven…eight…nine…
I opened my eyes. I had just felt something change, something in the air. A shift in energy, a draining of something that was no longer there.
I sat panting for a few moments longer and then let out a long breath, releasing the tension I had been holding inside of me.
Cautiously, I reached out and grasped the curtain in front of me. I stood, my old bones sighing, and dragged a shaking hand across my brow.
I opened the curtain.
And the sanctuary stood empty.
Not long after that, I gave up the cloth. I just couldn’t do it anymore. Something about that day shook me to the very essence of my being. I’ve discussed the event with a couple of other priests and they just don’t understand.
I don’t blame them. When I recite my story, it sounds like the ramblings of a mad man. Who would alter their life so drastically based on one interaction? Especially considering the circumstances.
But I have, and I don’t regret it. Something about prayer just feels so empty now.
I don’t know what’s going to happen when I die. In truth, no one does.
But what I do know…is what I felt that day inside the confessional. That was real. When I strip away everything else, all the questions, and oddities…that twist in my gut is what remains. I can’t explain what I witnessed. I can’t rationalize the bizarre sounds I heard. I can’t reenact the conviction I heard in that man’s voice.
But it was there and it was real.
And that…is what I have put my faith into."	9.64	11.0	Elias Witherow	11/07/2020
Every Year on My Birthday, I Have to Die	"I died for the first time on the 18th of August, 2006. It wasn’t a particularly pleasant death, nor was it one that I expected. It was simply the random act of violence that destroyed my life… and it came out of nowhere.
We were just relaxing at the pub, enjoying a few drinks after a busy day at work. It was my turn to buy a round of drinks, so I was trying to get the attention of the bartender.
I felt someone punch me in the side. At first, I thought someone had just hit me, but then I felt the warmth, and the rapid stream of blood pouring down my shirt. I realized then and there, that I’d actually gotten stabbed.
As far as I can remember, it wasn’t even that painful. Still, my legs gave out under me, and I collapsed to the floor. Even then I worried more about ruining my expensive suit, ignoring the fact that I might be dying.
Oncoming death is funny like that. Everyone thinks they’re the exception, that they’ll get out from whatever horrible situation the universe has thrust upon them.
At least that’s what I thought, as the life drained from my body. The world around me just faded to black, and before I knew it, I had just died.
Then there was the void. At first it was little more than darkness, only broken by weird shapes and colors in the distance. As I regained a sense of surroundings, I was dragged towards a new world, one without pain or suffering, nor death. All there was were people on a journey to different destinations. Whether they had all died like me, or if they weren’t born yet, I didn’t know. All I knew was that I wasn’t afraid anymore. The worries, the anxiety, and all my fears had been left behind.
A light appeared in the distance, endlessly far away. I knew that would be my final destination, my final purpose in the brief life I’d led. Unfortunately, I never managed to get that far…
* * * * * *
I was jolted awake in my own bed, soaking wet from sweat and shaking like a maniac. My hand reflectively clutched my side to cover up the wound I’d sustained… but it wasn’t there anymore. In fact, I didn’t have a single scratch on me.
Had it all been a dream?
My phone lit up on the bedside table. I picked it up to find dozens of text messages and missed calls.
“Hey man, we’re at the pub. You coming or what?” the first message read, sent at 9:43 PM.
“Hey, Rick, where the hell are you?” the second message read, sent at 10:23 PM.
Then there were a couple of phone calls, and another message.
“I guess you fell asleep, or maybe you’re getting lucky? Whatever, I’ll drink another shot in your honor. Happy birthday, Rick.”
Then I had over twenty phone calls, and a singular message that sent shivers down my spine.
“For fuck sake, pick up the damn phone! Something happened to Danny.”
I immediately called back. My fingers were trembling both from anticipation, and from the memory of what had happened only a night ago. Even if my death had been little more than a nightmare, I knew for sure that I’d met up with my friends at the pub.
The phone rang three times, and then Jake picked up.
“Rick, is that you? Where the hell are you?” Jake asked with a panicked, tired voice.
“I – I don’t know what happened. I guess I fell asleep?” I half-asked, half-stated.
“Danny got stabbed last night,” Jake said without listening to my explanation.
“Stabbed? How?”
“I don’t know. Some nut-job just walked up to him, and stabbed him in the side.”
I almost dropped my phone in shock. Danny had been attacked just like me, in exactly the same place. A thousand thoughts rushed through my mind, but worry quickly became my main concern.
“Is he alright?”
“He’s still in surgery. They’re only letting his wife know about – wait, here she comes.”
Jake put his phone down, but I could still hear the muffled sound of their discussion. Danny’s wife seemed upset, but I couldn’t make out the words.
“Jake?” I asked.
“He’s – he’s dead… Danny’s dead…”
The next few moments turned into a blurry haze of information. We’d all known Danny since we were kids, and now he was just gone. The murderer never even made it out of the pub. Apparently, he got shot by one of the patrons, as he tried to attack another guest.
Still, I just couldn’t shake the feeling that I was supposed to die that night.
Regardless of what happened, time marched on without answers. Some of our coworkers quit after Danny’s death, trying to hopelessly move on. I didn’t blame them, I also needed some distance. I never even told them what I experienced that night; it wouldn’t have helped them anyway.
A year passed, and I hardly spoke to any of my friends. I started to get some semblance of normalcy in the wake of Danny’s death, but that would all come to an end on the 18th of August, 2007.
My birthday had arrived yet again, and I had absolutely no intention of celebrating it. Instead, I called in sick to work, bought a bottle of whiskey, and spent the day playing video games.
By the time day had given way to night, I’d almost finished the bottle. Even as a rather large guy, the alcohol had hit me hard. At around nine o’clock, I just passed out in bed, awaiting a horrible hangover in the morning.
I only awoke around midnight, when I heard the front door forcefully break open, followed by footsteps and whispers. I tried to get up, still drowsy from the alcohol. As I took one step out from my bed, I slipped and tumbled down onto the floor. It produced a massive crash, loud enough to alert whichever intruders had broken in.
“I thought you said no one would be home?” a man stated angrily.
“Don’t worry about it; I’ll go deal with them.”
The footsteps moved quickly in my direction. I tried to lock the door, but they were too fast, kicking it open and knocking me back to the ground.
A masked man entered my room, holding onto a gun. He only spoke a single sentence to me, before pointing the weapon at me, and pulling the trigger.
“You should have stayed quiet.”
Unfortunately, the man was a horrible shot. He’d aimed at my head, but had hit me in my throat instead. There I lay, drowning in my own blood as I desperately gasped for air. I couldn’t crawl away, and I couldn’t call for help.
I died on my bedroom floor, on my own birthday, just as I had a year earlier.
Once the life finally drained from my body, and the God-awful pain ceased, I was back in the world beyond. I walked through the same, colorful dimension that lay just on the edge of life. I admired the shapes and colors as they passed.
In the distance, I saw a tree with branches stretching endlessly far from its trunk. From each branch dangled a person, real but not existing in our world. I wanted to visit them, but that wasn’t my destination. Because just like before, I would awake in my own bed, unharmed by the events from the previous night.
My phone buzzed, and I was filled with unfathomable dread. I still couldn’t quite believe it, but I started to understand that someone would take my place in death.
“Hello?”
“Rick, it’s Dad.  Your mother, she’s… she passed away last night.”
A lump formed in my throat. I knew what was coming next, but I had to ask.
“How… what happened?”
“The police say it was a burglary gone wrong. I don’t know, I was working late… I should have been there…”
The discussion trailed off from there. My Dad was distraught, and could barely form coherent sentences. He blamed himself for not being there, but I knew the truth. It was my fault.
During the next two months, he fell into a deep depression. I couldn’t blame him; he’d just lost the love of his life. I moved in with him, just to help him pick up the pieces. He put on a strong face, trying his best to keep the ship afloat, but I could tell how close he was to breaking down.
“If only I’d been there…”
“It wasn’t your fault, Dad. Had you been there, you might be gone, too.”
“You don’t know that.”
But I did know, because the burglars weren’t ever supposed to visit my parents’ house. They were supposed to kill me. I had to come clean; I had to let him know the truth. But how could I?
Half a year passed, and the secret ate at me. After everything that had happened, I still didn’t know how to explain it. Still, I decided it was time to share my curse.
“Dad, can we talk?”
“Yeah, what’s going on?” he asked with a worried expression on his face. He knew me well, and he could tell a heavy burden was weighing me down.
I started by telling him about my first death, down to the smallest detail. Of course, it matched everything that people had witnessed in the pub that night, even the location of the stab-wound. I told him Danny had taken my place in death, and that I felt guilty.
Naturally, he was skeptical at first. But then I told him about my mother. I didn’t spare him any details; I told him where I’d gotten shot, that the door had been broken down, and that there were two robbers. Every detail matched perfectly down to the letter.
“I’m so sorry, Dad. It was my fault. I killed her.”
He just sat there in silence, processing what I’d just told him.
“It wasn’t your fault.”
I was confused. There wasn’t a single ounce of anger in his words, only overwhelming empathy.
“How can you say that? She didn’t have to die.”
He mulled over his next words carefully before speaking. “You didn’t do anything wrong, Rick. You just went about your life, and these things happened to you. I don’t know why you’ve been brought back, or even how, but you’re not to blame for what is done to you.”
“So you believe me?” I asked.
He nodded and embraced me in a hug. Suddenly I wasn’t alone in the world anymore; someone knew what was happening to me.
“What if it happens again?”
“Then we’ll get through it together.”
He stood by these words, even as my next birthday rolled around. That death was tamer. I just slipped in the shower and broke my neck. The last thought that went through my mind as I left the world for the third time, was: “How fucking cliché…”
Once again, I awoke in my bed. I called out for my dad, making sure he was still alive, horrified that he might have taken my place. I couldn’t even breathe until he came rushing to my side, asking what had happened.
“I broke my neck… But I’m fine, I think.”
It took a while before I figured out who had taken my place that time. But once I heard that my boss had died, something broke inside me. He was the kindest man I’d ever met, and just like me, he’d slipped and broken his neck.
That was the final straw. It was neither some bizarre coincidence I could brush off, nor a premonition. I decided then and there that I couldn’t live with the responsibility. I had to put a stop to it, even if it meant giving up my own life.
I figured that if I took control over my own fate, and killed myself outside of my own birthday, maybe I could prevent more people from dying.
First, I left behind a long letter to my father, explaining why I’d chosen to leave. I couldn’t face him in person, I knew he’d just try to talk me out of it, but it was something I had to do. I couldn’t allow any more people to die on my behalf.
Alas, fate is a fickle bitch. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t end my own life.
I tried hanging, but the rope broke. Then, I tried to shoot myself, but the gun jammed. When that failed, I tried to drive my car into a tree, but I somehow survived that as well.  Any attempt was met with failure. All I could do was wait for my next birthday and let someone die in my place. No matter how many times I tried, I couldn’t die. I was a slave to destiny, and it was destroying me.
In 2009, I was hit by a drunk driver… and my girlfriend took my place.
In 2010, I drowned… and my kind neighbor had to go through that death.
In 2011, I died from a brain aneurysm… which ended up killing my aunt.
And so on, and so on… Each year I’d die, and a person close to me would take my place. I kept trying to find a way out, but fate wouldn’t have it.
Years went by, and on the 18th of August, 2019, I would die for the fourteenth time. I’d already fallen sick a week earlier, much to the doctors’ confusion. According to each and every laboratory value, I was fine, yet I kept getting sicker. My father and I both knew my time was near, but we also knew I’d be forcefully brought back.
Then, at midnight on my birthday, my heart just gave out. I was jolted awake in my own bed, and the sickness was little more than a distant memory.
“Dad?” I called out.
No response.
I got out of bed and called his name again. I was met with silence. I didn’t have to call out a third time; I already knew what had happened. I carefully walked into his room, horrified at what I knew would come…
He was dead… just gone from a heart attack. He’d taken my place, and I could do nothing to save him.
* * * * * *
The funeral came and went in a blur. The only noticeable thing was the missing seats from the people who had passed before him. Some of them had lived their own lives and died as nature intended, but a number of them were supposed to live on.  Instead, they’d just taken my place in death.
I inherited a number of things from my father. Among them, I found a letter addressed to me. It looked rather worn, so I could tell he’d written it a long time ago.
“Dear Richard,
Today is your birthday, and it has officially been a year since your mother passed. While I miss her greatly, I’m thankful to still have you around. I know that if she was given the choice, she would want you to live; I feel the same way.
We both know that I might one day take your place in death. Never doubt that I would happily give my life if it meant that you may live. You didn’t choose this curse, so never blame yourself, just do what every person is supposed to: Appreciate the people around you, because you never know which day might be their last.
I love you,
Dad”
Since I read that letter, I’ve been looking for a way out. My father might want me to stay behind, but how can I live on, knowing that I’m taking someone’s place?
I’ve long since left town, living by myself in a cabin somewhere away from people. Hopefully, if I have no one left that cares for me, people will stop dying.
At least until I can figure out not only how to die, but how to actually stay dead.
I’m sorry."	9.53	15.0	Richard Saxon	11/04/2020
I Found a Lump on My Arm, Now We’re All Going to Die	"Mortality is a weird thing.  It hits you like a bag of bricks once you make it to your late twenties or early thirties. It’s about the time when your family starts getting diagnosed with all kinds of disease, heart attacks, strokes, cancer…
For me, facing mortality meant something as innocuous as finding an odd lump on my arm while showering.
It might not sound like a big deal, but it’s important to note that my younger brother died from osteosarcoma, a fairly aggressive bone cancer, and for him, it was nothing more than a small, tender, unmoving lump he found on his leg.
Even then, it was too late, and he died a year later at the age of seven, which meant I was absolutely horrified to discover a similar lump on myself.
Over the course of a few days, as I awaited my doctor’s appointment, the lump grew ever-so-slightly. It had a strange shape, like a column of bone that hurt to touch.
During the examination, the doctor looked at me with concern in his eyes. It pretty much confirmed what I’d already suspected, that the growth was bone, and that it would probably turn out to be cancer.
He didn’t hesitate with referring me to a radiologist, and told me to return once the imaging had been done.
A few days later I returned, and as I sat in the office, on the brink of tears, a thousand thoughts ran through my head: What to tell my sister, how to spend the remaining time left on Earth, would it hurt as much as it did with my brother? At the very least they’d certainly have to amputate my arm, which would severely compromise my gaming abilities, can you even drive with one arm?
Then the doctor called me in…
He didn’t seem concerned, but baffled, as if he hadn’t the faintest clue what was wrong with me.
After some consideration, he finally started speaking, unleashing a jumbled mess of medical terms and incomprehensible sentences. He took a deep breath before finally stammering out:
“It– it’s not cancer,”
Despite the presumably good news, he didn’t seem relieved. There was something he held back.
“Then what’s wrong?” I asked.
“It’s a– it’s a tooth.”
He couldn’t explain it any further, so he just showed me the x-ray. Even with my limited anatomical knowledge, I could see it clear as day: a tooth was growing straight out from my ulnar, its roots firmly cemented in the bone, while the crown pushed on the surrounding tissue.
On one hand, it wasn’t cancer.  On the other, I had an impossible, bizarre growth extruding from the wrong part of my own skeleton.
The doctor sat down with me and explained the concept of teratomas, a type of benign tumor that frequently grows hair, skin and partially-developed organs. Despite its unusual presentation, we settled on that idea and scheduled me for surgery.
It was a quick and simple procedure. A couple of days later, they discharged me and told me to rest a bit before returning to work.
I was content, though admittedly a little bit disturbed by the whole ordeal.
Life went on, and my arm healed up nicely. The scar almost completely covered up by the inappropriate amount of hair I’d started growing during my teenage years.
A couple of weeks passed, and the surgery was all but a distant memory.
Then, after a morning of increasing back pain, I found blood in my urine…
Doctors will typically tell you not to get all riled up just because you found blood in your piss, because it could be caused by pretty much anything, and might not be blood at all.
However, I did worry, and with a sense of panic, I rushed to the emergency clinic, where they quickly tested my urine to confirm the presence of hemoglobin.
That, alongside my back pain, made them feel confident I was suffering from nothing more than an innocent little kidney stone.
One of the interns performed an ultrasound scan just to rule out cysts and whatnot, but her casual demeanor quickly turned to an expression of fear as she put the sensor against my skin.
She excused herself and left the room, only to return after ten minutes, dragging with her an older, presumably more experienced doctor. He seemed annoyed to have been called in for something as simple as an ultrasound.
He grabbed the device without introducing himself, and tried looking for a kidney. Just as with the intern, his annoyed confidence quickly turned to one of worry, and he too, left without explaining what the hell was going on.
By then, my discomfort had turned to excruciating agony. They’d already put me on an overabundance of painkillers, but it barely put a dent in the suffering I had to endure.
I stood up to grab hold of the doctor, ready to demand answers, but once I got to my feet, my vision started fading, and I collapsed to the ground.
From there, my memory was hazy; a combination of pain and drugs put me in a trance-like state. I vaguely remember being taken for some sort of scan, and a tube being shoved down my throat, and finally, everything turned black.
* * * * * *
It would take me two days to awaken once more. At which point I was greeted by a team of specialists, all looking way out of their depth.
They explained as best they could: That I’d fallen into a coma following severe, internal bleeding, and that I was an inch away from death when I was brought into the operating theatre.
I had almost died, and if not for an insane stroke of luck, I wouldn’t have realized.
Despite the success of the surgery, they still seemed nervous, and I could tell there was more to the story. After a lot of talking around the point, and even more bizarre medical terms I couldn’t possibly comprehend, I got mad.
“Just tell me what the fuck is happening to me!”
The oldest of the bunch, finally stepped up and started explaining himself.
“Mr. Woodcomb, to be brutally honest, we haven’t the faintest clue what kind of affliction you’ve come down with. Quite frankly, it’s beyond anything we’ve dealt with in the past.”
“Wha– What does that mean?  Am I going to die?” I asked.
He took a deep breath.
“We can’t know how the disease will progress, but–”
“What is happening to me?” I yelled as I tried to sit up, still too groggy from the drugs, unable to feel the presence of my own body.
He explained what had happened to me, that my stomach had started migrating towards my left flank, where it had enveloped itself around my kidney, slowly, but certainly absorbing and digesting it. The process obviously severed its blood supply, which caused the bleed that almost killed me. They’d fixed the tooth, and they’d stopped the bleeding, but a part of me knew it wasn’t over.
“I’m still not fixed, am I?” I asked.
He shook his head.
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Woodcomb, but this disease, we don’t know how to stop it. At this point, we’re just treating the symptoms.”
By then, I’d woken up enough to coordinate my movements, but I still couldn’t feel my right arm.
I turned my head to check on it, and saw that the vast majority of my lower, and half my upper arm, had turned almost completely white. I tried to lift it, but my muscles simply wouldn’t budge.
The skin looked so smooth, like perfect silk covering an almost shapeless blob. I’d always been a skinny, albeit toned person, so my veins were fairly prominent. Except that now, they’d all seemingly vanished from my forearm, leaving nothing but a stump of a vessel I could see actively retract away under my skin.
“It happened just before you woke up.  There was no time.  We couldn’t–”
“What the fuck is happening to me?” I asked once more.
“We don’t know,” he said.
I looked at him in despair; these were the people that were supposed to help me.  If even the professionals were baffled, I was screwed.
“Mr. Woodcomb, your arm has absolutely no blood supply. I’m sorry, but we need to amputate it as quickly as possible.  You shouldn’t even be awake right now.”
They made me sign a consent form before proceeding. Just the act of writing my own name with my one remaining, functioning arm, was an excruciating ordeal.
Another few hours went by, and my right arm was a part of the past.
Once I woke up from my third surgery, the doctors informed me that I was to be transferred to a more specialized health facility; they didn’t even have the courtesy to call it a hospital.
They airlifted me, wrapped in a containment box of sorts, to prevent the spread of a disease that could potentially be contagious.
While flying, I was strapped down with no view of my surroundings. Wherever they were taking me, they wouldn’t tell, and based on the few glimpses I got of the world beneath us, I wouldn’t have known anyway.
On the ground, I was met by a team of doctors dressed in hazmat suits. The ‘health facility,’ looked more like a warehouse than anything else, and didn’t ease the growing fear within me.
They rolled me through an airlock, ensuring nothing infectious could get in, or out.
The inside of the facility was a massive, isolated room with hundreds of patients lined up next to each other, no rooms for privacy, nor drapes to keep them apart, which meant that they all probably suffered from the same condition as me.
One of the patients stared at me. He panted with shallow breaths, as his chest had transformed into a thick wall of bone, each rib fused together, making breathing an almost impossible task.
Another, younger woman, had skin that seemed to be shrunken a few sizes too small, stretching to the point where it had become a pathetic cover of epithelium, allowing her muscles to be clearly visible.
But the worst was the patient in the bed next to mine. All his limbs had been amputated, and the entirety of his skin was covered in thick, bright red arteries, some of them actively bleeding, while others had been burned in a futile attempt at cauterizing them.
He groaned in agony, almost inaudible, strained sounds emerging from his toothless, tongueless mouth. His eyes and nose were missing, replaced by seemingly healthy skin, simply grown over most of his orifices, including his ears and scalp.
He was trapped in pain, unable to hear, see, or communicate with the world around him, but if he could, I’m certain he would’ve begged for death.
After a couple of hours of staring at the horrifically mangled people around me, a doctor approached me. He was a tired looking, old man that had been broken by the afflictions of others.
“I’m Dr. Foreman.  Your name is Eric Woodcomb, correct?”
I nodded.
“I’m going to administer a drug.  It’ll slow down the progression of the disease.”
“Will it help, can you please help me?” I asked frantically.
He looked around, seeming to check if anyone could hear us speak.
“It’ll slow it down, but it won’t cure it. We’re not even sure what causes this disease, but anti-mitotic drugs seem to put it into a sort of stasis.”
“What is ‘it,’ exactly?” I asked with a trembling voice.
“It’s an infection, Mr. Woodcomb, though it’s not bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, or prion in origin. All I know is that it affects anyone that touches it, and that we’re not going to be able to contain it for long.”
I then asked a question I already knew the answer to.
“Am I going to die?”
He just nodded, his emotionless face never changing.
“Ho–how long do I–” I said, before he interrupted me.
“A week, maybe two. Once the disease has converted all of your organs to an incomprehensible mess, and when even the most experienced forensics team would be unable to recognize your corpse as that of a human being, that’s when you’ll die.”
His bedside manner left a lot to be desired, but it was obvious that he’d gone through that speech a hundred times before. He was detached, desensitized from the nightmare that surrounded him.
As he turned around to leave, I noticed his arm had bone spicules, skeletal spikes protruding through his skin.
“Doctor, your arm.”
He looked down at it and sighed. “I told you it was infectious, everyone in this room, staff, patients, even the fucking dogs that have lurked around the site. The guys outside wearing hazmat suits have been hunting them down, but it’s too late for that. Not that their fancy protection gear will help them, but I’m not going to break that news to them.”
I was speechless, and he could tell his words hadn’t comforted me in the least, he just didn’t care.
“I’m sorry, but you should make peace with your family, friends, whatever you have in this world, because if we don’t find a viable cure within the next week, they’re torching this place.”
* * * * * *
As the days progressed, they kept bringing in more and more patients. Some looked mostly normal, healthy even, while others were unrecognizable, their faces replaced by a solid mesh of flesh, and their organs relocated to the surface of their skin.
One of them had his heart placed outside of his chest, beating as if nothing had happened, with thousands of additional arteries extending from it, like a red spiderweb covering most of his torso.
The pain must have been too much, because as he walked past my bed, he grabbed his own heart, attempting to rip it off. A few of the arteries tore open, spurting crimson blood all around him, but the heart itself wouldn’t budge.
He groaned, and with one final pull, he fell dead to the ground, clutching a clump of meat he’d managed to pull from the now, dead heart.
As they lifted his lifeless body onto a stretcher, I got a better view of his face. I realized that I recognized him. He’d been the doctor that examined my lump, the tooth stuck in my bone.
He died because of me…
On the fifth day of my containment, I started to lose vision in one of my eyes. I could feel it pulsating, growing within its socket, but I didn’t dare look at myself in the mirror.
A few hours passed, and suddenly I just felt a pop, followed by the sensation of a viscous liquid, trickling down my face.
My eye had exploded, and still, I didn’t have the guts to put myself in front of a mirror or to call out for help.
In a couple of days, they’ll burn this place to the ground in an attempt at preventing the spread of whatever disease has infected us. The doctors aren’t hopeful about a cure, but fire seems the safest option, just turning us all to ash, a price worth paying to save the world I suppose.
At least they’ve given us all a chance to call our loved ones, but I don’t have much of a family left, so to speak.
The thing bothering me the most is that I’ll most likely die without knowing what killed me, where the disease came from, and how I could have avoided it all together; Hindsight is 20/20 and all that.
Not that it matters to me.  I’m already dead, but whatever finally got me, it’s still out there…"	9.86	14.0	Richard Saxon	11/01/2020
My Job Is to Watch People Die	"Once your time on this Earth ends, Death will greet you like an old friend. Whether you embrace it with fear, hatred, or acceptance, is a question that cannot be answered before you stand at its door.
I can’t tell you what comes next, nor can I offer you comforting thought about an eternal afterlife. All I can promise you is that when it happens, you won’t be alone.
Up until Thursday, the 6th of December, 2007, I had never considered myself anything out of the ordinary. As a teacher at the local high-school, the best I could hope for was to aid in building our future. Though not an easy job, it was one I loved.
Then, on the evening of the sixth, as I returned home after grading a bunch of unsatisfying essays, I received a text message from a hidden number. It contained nothing more than a time, a place, and a vaguely familiar, yet generic name.
“Friday 5:34 AM, Locke Road 4. Juliet Florence.”
Any logical person would have arrived at the conclusion that the message had reached the wrong recipient. Yet, as soon as I lifted the phone and read the message, a shiver shot down my spine, and something within me felt compelled beyond any reasonable explanation, to go check it out.
The road itself was an hour’s drive out of town, situated in a desolate area, only occupied by abandoned farms and barren fields. It would have been the perfect place to lure someone out, and kill them without anyone ever knowing. Despite this horrific fact, I wasn’t worried. All I felt was compassion for whoever else would be there, without understanding why.
I couldn’t accurately explain the immense feeling of purpose that had arisen within me. It was an odd mixture of unrelenting fear, sadness, and pity. It felt as if my entire life had led to that very moment, and then nothing mattered more than being at that location, at that time.
Friday morning arrived, and I’d been lying in bed without a minute of sleep, in anticipation of what would happen. As 4 AM rolled around, I attempted to sneak my way out of bed, careful to not wake my sleeping wife, Anna.
Of course, it was a futile attempt, with Anna being the lightest sleeper on the planet, able to sense my thoughts, and waking up because she claimed they were too loud.
“Alex, what’s wrong?” she asked without even opening her eyes.
“Nothing’s wrong, I just need to catch up on some papers,” I lied. “But… why would you think something’s wrong?”
“You had a worried breath,” she mumbled, already drifting back to sleep.
I let a brief smile slip, and kissed her on the forehead.
“Everything is great, Anna.  I’ll see you after work, alright?”
She mumbled something incoherent in response, and I left the house.
Secrets had never been an aspect of our five-year-long marriage, but on that particular day, I couldn’t bring myself to tell her the truth.
On the hour-long drive over to Locke Road, a thousand questions flew through my mind. Who had sent the message? Why did Juliet Florence sound so familiar, and what compelled me enough to risk following the instructions, or lack thereof, from such a cryptic message?
It was a dark journey through the barely illuminated skies of dawn. Though the sun still hadn’t peeked up from the horizon, it still gave the sky a deep-blue hue.
Once I got close to my destination, I noticed something down the road. It was a car that had flipped over, crushed under its own force as it had crashed into the ditch. I stopped my car and quickly approach the wreck, already preparing to dial 911.
“Help!” a weak voice called from the car.
In the driver’s seat, pinned between the dashboard, steering wheel, and seat, sat a woman with a large piece of metal protruding through her chest. The debris had lodged itself into the seat, making it impossible to get loose, but even removing it would almost certainly have killed her, as it was the only thing keeping her from bleeding out.
With shaking hands, I called for an ambulance. We were practically in the middle of nowhere, meaning it would take the ambulance almost half an hour just to arrive. Which would be more time than the poor woman had left.
“It hurts so much,” she cried weakly.
A feeling of helplessness washed over me, as the fact of her imminent death became abundantly clear. I could do nothing but keep her company as the life drained from her body.
“I didn’t think it would be like this,” she said. “I’m so scared.”
“You’ll be alright, help is on the way,” I lied.
She reached out, trying to remove the piece of metal lodged into her chest, worsening the bleeding.
“You have to lie still!”
Despite my order, she kept trying to move, mumbling incoherently to herself. I decided my best bet would be to keep her mind occupied on simple questions, keeping her mind working as we waited for help that couldn’t possibly get there in time.
“What’s your name?”
“Juliet. What – what’s yours?”
“I’m Alex. What were you doing all the way out here?”
“Alex? Oh no, I’m sorry,” she said senselessly, barely audible, before she started to lose consciousness.
“No, no, Juliet, stay awake!”
I said it loud and with purpose, awakening her for just a moment. During the last few seconds of her life, she just stared into my eyes and whispered for the second time: “I’m sorry.”
Then she stopped breathing, and I could do nothing save wait for the ambulance to arrive. I felt numb, empty after having so futilely witnessed someone’s life end suddenly, and unexpectedly.
The emergency services came to the scene, and took her lifeless body away, while the police asked me a couple of questions to clarify what had happened. She’d seemed so familiar, and she responded so oddly when I told her my name, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.
I returned home without going to work. Anna had the day off, and immediately noticed something was off about me. I broke down and told her about the accident. I told her I’d watched that poor woman die, confused and afraid, and that I could do nothing to help. What I didn’t tell her, was that a text-message had told me to be there, not because she wouldn’t believe me, but because something deep within me prevented me from uttering the words.
She embraced me, and tried to comfort me by saying that I did my best to help her, that at least she didn’t die alone. It was a minor detail, but had I not been there, she might just have faded away, rotting for days before anyone else passed down that desolate road.
That should have been the end of it. Weeks passed, and I slowly got over the trauma. Then, as I headed to work one cold morning in January of 2008, I received another message. It contained a time, a place, and a name: Jeremy Brooks.
This time, the address was a local motel, only five minutes away. I wasted no time, and called an ambulance, and got in my car to drive there myself.
Being far closer than the hospital, I arrived before the ambulance. I rushed inside the apartment complex and barged in through the unlocked door. There, on the couch, sat a man I presumed to be Jeremy; Pale as a sheet, and bleeding profusely from large gashes on each of his forearms.
It was apparent that he’d slit his own wrists, and had simply sat himself down as he awaited his rapidly approaching end. He looked up at me with a fearful expression on his face.
“Who are you?” he said as he fell over, too weak from blood loss to keep himself upright.
I grabbed a T-shirt off the floor and wrapped it as tightly around his arm as I could. Even with three layers, it hardly seemed to stop bleeding.
“Come on, don’t do this. Stay with me!” I said as I looked for something better to wrap around his wound.
Despite my best efforts, there was little I could do for him. Jeremy tried to sit up, but in his weakened state, he just kept slumping over.
Then, a light lit up in his eyes, as he was hit with the realization that he wanted to keep living. A wish that came to him all too late.
“Please, help me,” he said. “I don’t want to die.”
Whatever trouble had led him to this stage, whatever had convinced him it would be better to leave Earth behind, he was wrong, and he knew it.
But I couldn’t help, and by the time the ambulance arrived, I’d watched yet another person’s soul fade away.
* * * * * *
Over the next month, I’d receive another seven messages. All with the signature time, place, and name. Seven people destined to die, alone and in pain.
I tried everything I could think of to prevent their deaths. I called the police, but they could do little without any evidence that something horrible was about to happen. Next, I attempted to reach out to the dying people, but to no avail. Not a single person accepted that I could provide them with future insight.
By the time they had died, and the eighth number arrived, I had long since decided to just ignore them. Why expose myself to the harsh reality of death, if I could do nothing to help? Of course, that just happened to be the one time Anna was looking over some photos she’d taken of us together. The message interrupted her session, and she immediately started questioning me. Oddly enough, I’d shut off notifications, yet the message came to taunt me at the most inopportune time.
“What’s this?” she asked.
I quickly snatched the phone out of her hand, but the damage was already done.
“What was that message?” she repeated sternly.
“It’s nothing, honestly. It’s just something from work,” I lied poorly.
“Alex, don’t bullshit me. You’ve been acting weird for weeks.”
It was true, my random disappearances, my denial that anything had been wrong. I couldn’t hide it any longer.
“I – I don’t –”  The words got stuck in my throat.
A thousand thoughts ran through my mind. I knew how suspicious it all seemed. I expected accusations of cheating, a hidden drug addiction, or worse, but instead of questioning me further, she just took my hand, and said: “Look, whatever is going on, that you’re too afraid to tell me, we’ll get through it together.”
While we stood there, with tears welling up in my eyes, someone knocked on the door.
It was the police.
“Alex Moore?” one of the officers half-asked, half-stated.
“We’re here regarding the death of Juliet Florence, and we need to ask you some questions.”
I followed them without hesitation. Telling my wife to call our lawyer, but even with his help, no one could explain why I’d been at the scene of the death of not only Juliet, but seven other people.
They questioned me for hours, and I could provide few answers. Thought it was an extremely bizarre situation, most evidence pointed towards the fact that I’d been helping the victims, and not killing them. In the end, they let me go, but the investigation was pending, and at any moment, they could’ve come for me.
Once I returned back home, I’d already missed the death of the eighth victim, whoever he was, he had died during my interrogation. I broke down and told my wife everything. If the investigation ended up with evidence going wrongfully against me, I needed her to know the truth.
We sat down, and I told her my story. I went over each and every death I’d witnessed, and expressed the absolute hopelessness that lingered over me for each and every day. It was an unbelievable story, but she didn’t stop once to question the validity of what I said. She just listened.
When I finished talking, once all the facts were laid out on the table, she looked at me, her eyes glistening from tears forming in her eyes.
“Alex, I’m so sorry,” she said.
That was it, no accusations, no follow up questions regarding the validity of my story, just pure compassion. We kept talking throughout the night, where we would go from there, and how I’d dealt with watching all these people die.
Then, as if a light bulb had been ignited between us, Anna came up with an idea.
“What if you’re not supposed to save them?”
I looked over at her, expectantly awaiting the next part of her suggestion.
“What do you mean, why else would I be sent their way just moments before their deaths?”
“What if you’re just supposed to be there, by their side? Maybe all you’re meant to do is give them some comforting words as they pass. I mean, you’ve tried everything possible to save them, but in the end, wouldn’t they just have died alone, if you weren’t there?”
I let her words sink in for a moment. It was an almost ludicrous idea, yet it gave me the most profound moment of peace. More bliss and hope than I’d felt in the past two months. She was right, there was no logic behind that feeling, but I knew it had to be true.
So, I patiently waited for the next message, and it wouldn’t be long before it arrived. As it so happened, it would be my next-door neighbor. An elderly woman whose name I barely knew, but who I know had become a widow last year, after her husband lost a long-winded battle with cancer.
I walked over to her small house, next to mine, and knocked on the door, fully aware that she’d be dead within the next couple of hours. She was a lonely woman, eager just to have someone to talk to, and I regretted not spending more time with her before. She’d always been friendly to me, offering cake when she baked, asking about my work as I passed by in the mornings, but I’d always been too busy to appreciate it.
I made no attempt at warning her about her ultimate fate, instead, we just talked. She told me stories about her husband, and I just listened intently to each word she spoke. She smiled as the memories flowed back, ones of a life well spent, a happy one.
As her time grew closer, she started feeling tired. I offered to make her some tea, and by the time I came back, she’d fallen asleep, never to wake up again. On her face, I could see an expression of peace, and I knew she hadn’t been afraid. She’d been ready, and I hoped whatever afterlife existed, would reunite her with her husband.
From then, my curse became more of an ally. It was a job I had to do, to watch people in their last moments, and comfort them as they left our world. I did my due diligence and alerted the authorities after each event, but it was nothing more than an anonymous tip, enough to lead them to the scene, but not enough to add suspicion.
I simply held their hands, or gave them a few words of comfort. I tried getting close to them before their last hour, be it just to strike up a friendly conversation, or to buy them a drink at the local pub, and most left with a look of acceptance, as if they trusted my assurances that everything would be fine.
Years went by, a whole decade of helping people pass peacefully to the other side. The power I’d called a curse so long ago, had become a welcome gift.
Then, in the late days of last year, as Christmas rolled around once again, Anna and I were wrapping presents for the holiday festivities, and family dinners. I’d gone almost a month without receiving another name, but that would end quickly, when I received another message that shattered my life with these simple words:
“Saturday, December 7th. 11:43 PM. Anna Moore.”
I froze in place and just stared at the name highlighted on my phone. Anna quickly noticed my absence from wrapping, and jolted me back to attention.
“You got another name?” she asked.
I nodded, not needing to speak another word for her to understand. The look of horror on my face said it all.
“Oh… how long do I have?” she simply asked, her normally cheerful voice turned dull and empty.
“We need to go to the hospital,” I demanded, knowing fully well that preventing the deaths was an impossible feat.
“Alex, don’t,” she said before I cut her off.
“We can stop this. It doesn’t have to happen!”
We argued for a bit, and she seemed oddly calm throughout the discussion. In the end, she agreed to get a checkup, if only to calm me down.
Of course, with a woman that appeared perfectly healthy, without as much as a cough, the doctors could only run her through the basic tests. To look for anything substantial was a futile task, as most tests would take weeks to return, which was time we didn’t have. In the end, we were sent home without a single answer.
“What if we leave? What if we just get out of town for a few days?” I suggested.
“Has any of the hundred people survived?” she asked.
She already knew the answer; I didn’t have to say it out loud.
Without a place listed in the message, it became apparent that she’d meet her fate wherever she was. So, we decided to make the best of what little time we had left.
In the following days, Anna stayed brave, putting up a beautiful facade of acceptance and joy. We reminisced about times long since passed, looked over photos and held each other for hours. At night, I could hear her cry in the living room, terrified not of what was to come, but of what she’d leave behind. I did my best to comfort her, but there was something hidden under the layers of love, and support… resentment.
“I wish you had never told me,” she said. “You should have just let me meet my death, ignorant like everyone else.”
She was right. I’d taken away one of the most beautiful things about life: its uncertainty. The idea of our temporary, fleeting presence here on Earth, the fact that any moment might be our last. The thing that makes us so tragically wonderful, and I’d taken it away.
Despite that, she never stopped loving me, and on her final day, she made me promise to never give up. There would be people that needed me after her demise. They would be alone at the final step in their life, and I couldn’t let them down.
Once her time came, it was nearing midnight. We’d both agreed not to mention her rapidly approaching death. She asked if we could go outside, to just look at the night sky one last time, to kiss under the moonlight, like we did on our first date.
But it wasn’t meant to be… No sooner had she stood up than she collapsed to the floor with no warning.
According to the doctors, my wife had suffered from a deep vein thrombosis. Basically, a clot had formed in her leg, to subsequently break off, traveling all the way up to her lungs, where it caused a pulmonary embolism… It killed her within seconds.
* * * * * *
The love of my life had died, yet the names never stopped coming. I was depressed, broken, and without the will to follow orders. I wanted to ignore the names, but I’d made a promise to keep going.
For the next two months, I chased down dying names as I got them. Five victims that didn’t have to suffer alone. I approached them, made them feel comfortable, and held their hand as they passed, but each name crossed off my list took away chunks of my own soul. Without Anna to support me, I had no energy to keep going. I just had to wait until whoever ruled my life, finally released me from my curse.
So I did, up until last night, when I received another message, one that differed from the rest. This time, there were no names, no places, nor a time. I was faced with nothing more than an innocuous question.
“Are you done?”
My mind raced. It was such a simple yet overwhelming question. What would happen if I said yes? Would I finally be free?
I thought long and hard, before deciding that I’d fulfilled my duty, that my time had come to let go, and let life happen the way it was meant to.
“Yes,” I typed into the phone.
Within a second, I got a response: “Who will be next?”
Then it clicked, as if the past decade of my life suddenly made sense, or at least partially. Juliet, my first ‘job,’ had not only been a random death. She’d chosen me as a successor, plunging me into a life she herself had lived.
Why she’d chosen me, remained a mystery. Maybe we knew each other long ago, met once and the name stuck, or maybe she picked me from a dusty phone book in her attic.
But, just like her, I’d been faced with the same dilemma…
I thought about the implications of choosing another person to suffer the same fate as myself, but before I could consider a name, another message popped up.
“Sunday: 8:49 PM, Hollow Street 7, Alex Moore.”
By quitting my job, I’ve effectively ended my own life. It’s not a fate I’m trying to escape, and I’ve already come to terms that I don’t have much time left. Though I still have a few days to sort out my business, there’s still one question that remains…
…Who’s next?"	9.82	11.0	Richard Saxon	10/31/2020
The Goat Room	"My phone buzzed in my pocket. I reached for it, only half-listening to the sales meeting I was in. My boss was rattling on, stressing about how we needed to push numbers, increase our revenue, the usual slog. The other eight salesmen around the table looked as bored as I did, staring with half-lidded eyes, mouths slightly ajar. We heard the same pitch every year and honestly, we were tired of it. If someone was dead set against buying, there was literally nothing we could do about it.
I loosened my tie and checked my phone under the table. The number was blocked. My heart skipped a beat. Could this be?
It was a text. It read: Congratulations, you’ve been accepted.
I wanted to jump up and pump my fist into the air, excitement rising in my chest like lava from a volcano. I couldn’t believe it. After all this time, I had finally done it. After all my hard work and dedication, all those times I went the extra mile and thought no one noticed. It felt good to know it was all worth something. It felt great. The possibilities this would open up, the life it could lead to…it was everything I had ever wanted.
I shot a glance at my boss at the head of the room (still rambling and pointing to a pie chart on the projector) and quickly sent a message back: When do I start?
I placed the phone on my leg, drumming the tabletop as I waited for an answer. I forced myself to breathe. I felt like I could burst for joy. I was tempted to give my co-workers the finger and walk out of the meeting, but resisted. I could stay professional about this. I wanted to call my wife and tell her the good news. She would be so proud of me. And the kids!? Wait till they heard what a hotshot their old man was about to become!
I was so proud of myself. I was setting such a good example for my family. I was really doing this. And to think they picked me?! I couldn’t help but smile thinking about it. My phone buzzed again and I quickly checked the reply text: We start tonight. Meet at Quincy Office at 8 pm for orientation. Feel free to bring your family. And well done!
I felt like I could die with excitement. Tonight!? My guts bubbled and I shifted in my seat. There was so much to think about, so much to prepare. I thought about what lay ahead of me and worms worked their way into my stomach.
I pulled up my wife’s number and sent her a quick text, not being able to help myself: They chose me!!! Orientation is tonight at 8! U and the kids can come! SO EXCITED!!!
The finality of it hit me then. Something about sharing the news with my wife made it real. This was really happening. I was really going to do this. Our lives were about to change forever. I was about to lead my family into the next tier of class.
I stood up suddenly, pocketing my phone. My boss and fellow salesmen looked up at me, eyebrows cocked. I looked around at their washed-out faces, almost feeling sympathy. How many of these poor saps would die at this job? How many of them had already settled into the monotony of what their lives had become? That’s what separated me from them. I strove to do great things.  I pushed myself and walked that extra mile. I had passions, fire in my chest.
“Do…you want to say something, Thomas?”
I blinked at my boss, staring down the long table at his expectant face.
“Thomas?” He called to me, finger hovering over the all-important pie chart.
I looked around at everyone, a small smile planted on my lips, “Uh…” I snorted, shaking my head, “Uh, I think I’m done here, guys. It’s been a real pleasure, but, uh…” I started laughing, not able to hold it in any longer, “but I got better things lined up! Take care now, you hear?” And with that, I marched myself out the door, followed by shocked stares.
When I got home, my wife met me at the door with a big hug and a sparkling smile. She told me she had left work as soon as she got my message. She was beaming, ushering me inside and taking my coat, compliments bubbling from her lips. She told me she was just so proud of me and all the hard work I had put into this. She told me I was special, that she had always known I was, and finally other people had noticed.
I asked her where the kids were, smiling myself, the excitement and rush still fueling my emotions. She told me they were at school, but she had called the principal and notified she needed to pull them early. They would be excited too, I just knew they would.
“What should I wear tonight? Are we going to be there for the whole orientation? Will they let us stay?” She asked, running into the bedroom and pulling out dresses from the closet.
I shrugged, grinning like an idiot.  “I don’t know, hun. I guess we’ll find out.”
She spun around, a small blue dress pressed to her frame, and said, “How’s this? Is this good? Oh, Thomas, I’m just so happy I could burst!” She ran over to me, giggling, and kissed me, her arms around my neck. She looked up into my eyes, admiration shining from her own.  “Can I tell everyone?”
I laughed. “They’ll all be at orientation! You can tell them then, before we start! You know how these things go.  We’ve been to enough of them, right?”
She smiled, a picture of beauty from ear to ear.  “I know, I know! It’s just so wonderful!” We picked up the kids together, my two boys, from their middle school. They climbed into the backseat, positively beaming that they had gotten a half-day. I wanted to take them out, have some fun, celebrate.
As my wife pulled the car out of the school parking lot, I leaned over my seat, grinning, and looked at my children.
“I bet you guys are wondering why you got to leave school early?” I couldn’t help but feel a little smug. They weren’t going to believe this.
They both shook their heads. “Well,” I said, folding my hands, “your ol’ dad, is going to ORIENTATION tonight! I’ve been accepted! Isn’t that great, kids!?”
Both my son’s mouths dropped in unison, followed shortly by whoops of excitement. I laughed and clapped my hands, enjoying their reaction to the news.
“Do we get to go?!” my eldest asked.
I nodded, “You sure do. All of you get to go. And guess what? It’s tonight!”
Well, that did it. They screamed, the hype just too much. I laughed until tears rolled down my face, watching the delight ripple across their faces like shock waves. It’s wonderful to have kids. Often times they say or react in the ways adults aren’t allowed.
Finally, I raised my hands and told them to settle down (still wiping the tears from my eyes). I told them we were going to have a family day of fun to celebrate and then after that, I was taking them to dinner. More eruptions of joy followed – along with a few shouts of ‘this is the best day ever!’ – and I chuckled again, asking them what they would like to do first.
After some discussion and negotiation amongst my family, we decided that we were going to go to the movies. After that, it was off to our favorite burger joint for dinner and milkshakes.
We spent the afternoon in the movie theater, slurping down overpriced soda and munching on stale popcorn. After the movie, I wiped butter from my kids’ fingers and ushered them back to the car. Despite having just consumed a barrel of popcorn, my sons moaned that they were sta-a-a-arving! Having not eaten but a few kernels myself, I was glad to hear it. I checked my watch and saw that we had two hours before we had to be at the Quincy Office.
We drove across town, our ride filled with commentary about the movie we had just seen (my sons loved it, my wife, not so much). I argued with my oldest about some of the plot points, goading him a little bit just because I was in such a good mood. My wife shook her head, smiling to herself and enjoying the positive energy that sparked around us.
Thirty minutes later, I pulled into the restaurant and parked. Already shouting out what they wanted to eat, the boys bounded from the car. I opened my door and got out, telling them to settle down, the burgers weren’t going anywhere.
As I watched my wife follow our kids, it hit me like a shotgun blast.
You’re going to the Goat Room tonight.
I bent over, suddenly in need of air, and sucked in the evening sky. I blinked a few times, clearing my head, the realization crippling my mind. I pulled in another couple of breaths and chuckled. The gravity of the night before me was astounding.
At that moment, I felt like the luckiest guy in the world.
I looked up and saw my wife calling me, asking if I was ok. I straightened, and gave her a thumbs-up and a big smile. I walked to them at the front of the restaurant, taking in my surroundings, letting the setting sun cast its warm rays across my face. What a time to be alive. We got a booth and ordered our food (I got my usual Buffalo Burger), watching the day fade into night through the windows.
We chomped through the patties, my kids devouring theirs with alarming speed, and I ordered us all a round of milkshakes (as promised). I didn’t think they needed any more sugar buzzing through their systems, but what the heck – we were celebrating, weren’t we?
As I watched my youngest slurp down the last of his frothy treat, I wiped his face with a napkin and checked my watch. My eyes met my wife’s and I nodded to her.
“You ready?”
I paid the bill and herded my family back to the car. From the restaurant, it was only a ten-minute drive to the Quincy Office. As the night blurred past the windows, I felt myself grow quiet. My wife seemed to notice and did her best to shush the kids. She knew I needed some serenity, the weight of the evening approaching fast. She squeezed my arm and offered me a smile. I returned it and focused on the road. I was grateful for her support, grateful for my wonderful family.
“You doing okay?” she asked quietly.  I nodded.
“Better than ever. This is just a big step for us, you know? It’s a lot to take in.”
We pulled into the Quincy Office, its many floors towering above the parking lot. I found us a spot and noticed a few familiar faces already entering the building. The kids took notice as well and began to unbuckle and call out to their friends. I let them go, turning the car off and smiling as they raced to their buddies.
The cool night air tickled my skin and I felt a kind of euphoric awe settle over me as I got out of the car. I walked around to my wife, taking her hand in mind. As we walked inside, we waved to Parkers and Kleins, both of whom had just arrived.
The interior of the building was air-conditioned and I nodded my hello to the security guard at the front desk. My wife signed us in (she always insisted on being the one to sign us in) and we went to the elevator. There was already a small crowd gathered around them, all waiting to ascend. I spotted my kids excitedly talking to their friends and I guessed they were already spilling the news.
Troy saw me and made his way over to us. He shook my hand and exclaimed, “Thomas, I heard your kids talking, I heard you got the promotion! Is it true?”
My wife answered before I could, admiration lacing her words, “It sure is, Troy!  I always knew he’d get it one day. He’s such a dedicated man.  How could he not get it?”
I blushed as Troy slapped me on the back and congratulated me. He called his own family over and told them the news, earning me another round of thumbs up and courteous congrats. At that point, the news was spreading around the lobby and I was suddenly assaulted by a barrage of handshakes and hugs from all our friends and acquaintances. They all wished me luck and I detected notes of jealousy from more than one of them.
Finally, we piled into the elevators and pushed the button to take us to the top. The whole way up I got slaps on the back and smiles, an endless stream of affirmation. It was a good feeling, a great feeling. I looked at my kids and saw their eyes glowing with respect for their ol’ dad. I reached out and ruffled their hair.
A ding announced our arrival at the top and we poured out, the doors closing behind us to collect the next batch in the lobby. My shoes clicked on the marble floors and I saw Kent and Bradly (both rocking beautiful grey suits, I might add) already waiting for everyone.
They held up their hands, smiling and quieting everyone. White light illuminated the hallway, casting a glare off the floor that almost stung my eyes. I blinked and focused on what Kent was saying.
“Alright everyone, settle down!” he announced with a grin.  “I know it’s a big night tonight, but we’ve all done this before. You know the drill.  Follow Bradly to the conference room and we’ll get started in just a little bit.”
He turned to me then, “Except for you, Thomas! You come with me and I’ll start prepping you for orientation. When you feel like you’re ready, we’ll join the others in the conference room.”
I turned to my family and gave them all a big hug. I kissed my sons on the head and my wife on the lips. She beamed up at me and gave me one quick nod. Go get ‘em.
The tide of people flowed down the hall, led by Bradly, towards the conference room. I went the opposite way, led by Kent, who brought me to his office. A beautiful, polished oak desk dominated the room, the walls lined with oil paintings nailed to dark wood. It was quite the contrast to the modern marble design of the hallway and as the door shut behind me, I felt like I was in a different building.
Kent waved for me to take a seat on the plump leather chair opposite the desk. With a contented sigh, he plopped himself down in front of his computer and leaned back, folding his hands on his chest. I took my seat across from him and licked my lips, feeling a little nervous.
“Are you nervous?” Kent asked, grinning.
I chuckled, “Yeah, I think so. But that’s a good thing, I think. I’m excited.”
Kent tapped the top of the desk, “Glad to hear it. Now, let’s get down to business. I know you’re aware of how the first part of this goes, correct? I’ll take you to the conference room and swear you in. After that, you’ll say a few words to everyone and maybe assure them of your dedication. After that, Bradly and I will escort you… well… I think you know the rest.”
I nodded, “Then I go to the Goat Room.”
Kent grunted, “Yes, then we go to the Goat Room.”
He leaned forward, “Now, do you have any questions for me? I’m assuming you know what happens after you’re sworn in and we move you? It’s a silly question.  I’m well aware you understand, but it’s something I have to ask.”
“I understand,” I said, “and I have only one question.  It’s about my family…”
Kent cut me off with a curt slice of the hand, “Worry not, Thomas. You’ve ensured a better life for not just yourself, but for them as well. The very fact that you’re sitting here has already sealed that.”
“Again, thank you, sir.”
He sat in silence for a moment, letting the words sink in. Then, he stood up and ushered me to the door.
“You ready?”
“Yes, sir.”
He led me out the door and down the hall, our footsteps echoing off the walls. I realized my palms were sweating and I wiped them on my pants. Everything I had worked so hard for was finally coming to fruition.
We entered a large room that was dimly lit. I looked to my left and saw the familiar stadium seating filled with shadowed faces, all excitedly watching me. Kent led me to a small table under a spotlight. As soon as we crossed the threshold of light, uproarious applause shook the room. I couldn’t help but smile, staring out at the familiar faces. I felt like I was in a college classroom about to give some freshmen a lecture that would change their lives. Bradly was waiting for us by the table, clapping along with the rest of them. I squinted and saw my wife and kids in the front row, beaming from ear to ear. I gave them a little wave and centered myself behind the table with Kent and Bradly standing at either shoulder.
They let the applause continue for a few moments before Kent raised his hands, quieting them. He walked around to the front of the table and began to speak.
“Good evening everyone and thank you for coming! Tonight marks the thirty-second promotion! Tonight we honor our devoted friend Thomas! Let’s all give him a hearty congratulations for all his hard work and contributions!” More applause spilled from the crowd and I began to feel like a celebrity. The room eventually settled and Kent turned to me, picking up a small black book from the table. He motioned for me to put my hand on it. I knew the drill. I had watched the thirty-two others before me go through the same ritual. I couldn’t believe I was standing up here, no longer just an observer.
I placed my hand on the book, already knowing the words that came next.
“Do you, Thomas James Martin, swear to uphold your position to the best of your abilities?” Kent said loudly, his voice echoing into the now silent room.
“I do.”
“Do you swear to give your life, if need be, in order to further our cause?”
“I do.”
“Do you swear upon your faith and family that you will proceed with the purest intentions?”
“I do.”
Kent then nodded, giving me a hidden wink, and passed the book over to Bradly who took it and motioned for me to place my hand on the cover again.
“Lastly, do you swear your loyalty and motivations are in accordance with our guidelines and that you will see this through until you have completed your task?”
“I do.”
He cleared his throat, then, “Thomas James Martin, I hereby congratulate you on your promotion, thank you for all you have done thus far, and pray for your continued dedication through all you endure.”
“Thank you, sir,” I responded.
Bradly glanced at Kent and they both nodded. The book was lowered and I was deafened by cheers and whistles. I smiled so hard I thought I’d rip my face in half. I winked at my wife and waved a hand to the crowd. Bradly and Kent both shook my hand and offered more congratulations. Bradly motioned me forward, offering the floor to me so that I could address everyone.
The room quieted as I licked my lips and prepared the words on my tongue.
“It is such an honor to be standing here tonight,” I said, my voice strong and sure.  “I owe so much of this success to the patience and guidance of these two men right here,” I pointed to Kent and Bradly, who nodded their thanks to me.
“I also want to thank my family,” I continued, “for their undying love. I want to thank you all for your kindness tonight. I promise not to let you down. I promise I will see this through to the very end if need be.” I paused, scanning the room, slowly, taking it all in, meeting everyone’s eyes.  “I love each and every one of you. I believe in what we do. I believe in you. I always have. And tonight I ask that you believe in me.”
The crowd went wild.
Kent and Bradly motioned for me. It was time to go. I waved to the people and exited the room to cheers and whistles.
It was time.
It was time to go to the Goat Room.
I had a sack over my head, the fabric blocking my sight completely. Kent was silent as he drove the van out of the city. Bradly was driving another one that held my family. I remained quiet, unsure if it was appropriate to speak. I felt the road vibrating through the floor as we trekked through the night. This was it. No going back now. I swallowed and felt my heart skip a few beats.
I don’t know how long we drove. This was part of the promotion ceremony that I had never been allowed to see. I knew what we were doing, but I was clueless as to how long it would take to get there. I wiped my hands over my knees, scrubbing more sweat from them. I summoned the faces of my family. They probably had to be blinded as well. I smiled inwardly, imaging my kids with black bags over their heads. They were probably complaining, giving Bradly a hard time.
Finally, after what felt like a few hours, I felt the van jerk to a halt and my ears picked up the spray of gravel under the tires.
“We’re here,” Kent announced, breaking the long silence. “Give Bradly a moment. He’s bringing your family inside now.”
I sat in the darkness as the van idled. My stomach churned as nerves wormed their way through my intestines. I took a breath to steady myself. I was ready.
“Let’s go,” Kent finally said, pulling the cloth from my eyes.
I rubbed my face, letting my vision adjust. We were at the end of a gravel road in the middle of an open field. In the far distance, I saw woods swaying in the night sky. A large single-story building stood before us, its plain concrete walls bare of windows. Despite its sprawling size, I only saw one entrance. I glanced at Kent and saw he was looking hard at me.
“You ready to do this?”
I nodded.  “Of course.”
We exited the van, the small rocks crunching beneath my feet. A yellow moon hung fat in the sky like an infected boil on dark skin. I followed Kent up to the entrance, noticing a few more cars parked in front of the building, along with the van my family had come in. They were already inside, waiting for me. I wiped a hand across my face. Steady now.
Kent pushed through the large black door, the entranceway lit by hanging fluorescents. I didn’t see anyone, the interior as bare as the concrete walls that lined it. The air was musky, some long-forgotten odor rising from the ground. I wrinkled my nose and followed Kent down a long hall, our feet echoing across the bare concrete floors. The ceiling was high over our heads, lights hanging from it like dead bodies, motionless in the still air.
“Where is everyone?” I asked.
“Waiting for you,” Kent answered without turning.
We turned down another hallway and were stopped by two large double doors. They pulsed with red light and I could hear sound from the other side. Candles illuminated the space, stuck into the walls like knives, hot wax running down the cement like dried semen.
Kent turned to me.  “Here we go. Ready?”
I nodded, pushing down my nerves.
Kent pushed the doors open and heat blasted across my face. The room before me was huge, circular in shape, its walls curving like a swollen stomach. A bright red light lit the space, shadowing everything beneath it in an eerie glow.
Seated along the far wall was The Word, his tall figure hidden by flowing red cloth that draped over his head and ran down to pool on the floor. He didn’t move under his garment, giving him a strange, statue-like appearance. Seeing him sit upon his bone-white throne, I wondered what he looked like, the fabric revealing nothing but a gentle pull around the mouth when he breathed.
Sitting to the left of him was my family, somber, but I could see a muffled excitement underneath their watchful eyes. Spanning out past my family were the rest of the Executives. They sat in their perfectly pressed business suits, eyes trained on me as I stood in the door. It was the first time I had seen them, knew who they were, and a couple of the faces surprised me.
The floor was covered with red markings, circles and hard angles crisscrossing along the concrete. Candles littered the floor, rising from the ground like broken teeth. The air was heavy and thick, almost fog-like, the red light obscuring my vision slightly.
I felt something prod my back and I turned to see Kent motioning me forward. Hesitantly, I moved towards the middle of the room and stood before The Word. I wondered where everyone else was, the prior thirty-two who had been promoted. I didn’t see them anywhere. Perhaps they’d come later? My eyes circled the room, meeting the gaze of the higher-ups. I wasn’t going to let them down. They’d see.
“Hello, dear Thomas,” The Word said, breaking the pregnant silence. His voice rolled across the space between us like a bulldozer.
I bowed my head slightly, a sign of respect. I couldn’t believe he was actually speaking to me. It was hard to not pop with pride. My children would one day tell stories of this night, every detail of the tale spooling out in front of me in real-time.
“Before we begin, I’d like to thank you for your unwavering loyalty. It has not gone unnoticed and tonight you will reap the rewards of your efforts and commitment to us.” The Word shifted slightly, the cloth covering his head wrinkling in the haze. The lack of any eye-holes gave his appearance an almost eerie look, as if under that robe, something inhuman dwelt.
“Thank you, sir,” I said, hoping it was okay to speak.
He spread his arms, the red cloth swallowing his limbs.  “Let us begin then.”
A door opened to the right of me, one I hadn’t noticed, and two huge men stepped into the room. They were stripped down to their waists, their faces covered with hoods, one white, the other black. Bulging muscles coiled across their shoulders as they carried in a large chest, decorated with flakes of black and gold. They came and stood beside me, gently lowering the chest.
When it was set, they turned to The Word and waited for his signal. My legs felt weak and I forced my knees to stop clacking together. This was what I had been waiting for. This is what it all came down to. I had talked the talk and now I had to walk the walk.
The Word stood, the red gown rippling across his body like dripping gore, and spread his arms again, “Thomas, you were born a man and now must be reformed into the image of our Lord. Kneel and be baptized with the blood of our God, so that your blood may be one with his!”
The men with hoods pushed me to my knees and I felt sweat bead along my forehead. It was suddenly excruciatingly hot in the room, the red light warming the air like fire. The ground was hard under my knees, my joints popping as I took my place, head raised and ready.
The man with the white hood opened the chest and took something out. He came and stood behind me, cradling my head with his bicep as he placed something in my mouth.
I took the funnel into my throat, holding it steady with my teeth. He reached back into the chest and pulled out a clear jug that sloshed with fresh goat’s blood. I gripped the funnel harder with my teeth. The jug he held had to be at least two liters and it was filled to the brim.
The man in the white hood took his place behind me and wrapped a meaty arm around my neck, holding me in place. My heart danced in my chest like a wild drum. Sweat trickled down my spine in anticipation. I could feel my kids watching me.
The hooded man took the top off with his teeth and tipped the mouth of the jug into the funnel. Blood sloshed into my mouth, taking me by surprise. It was warmer than I had imagined. I closed my eyes as it streamed across my tongue, flowed down my throat, and filled my stomach. It tasted like burnt metal, the thick liquid coating my insides.
More…  More…  More…
I began to sputter, opening my eyes and realizing I still had over half the jug to drink. My stomach felt distended, a bloated bubble of sick nausea. I began to cramp and I had to fight my gag reflect as I ingested the blood, feeling it mix in my gut with bitter acid.
The man tightened his grip around my neck as he felt my body tense. I fought to keep the fluid down. It felt like I was drowning. I forced my eyes shut again, my stomach howling as it continued to fill. I hiccupped and burped, spraying red out the side of my mouth. It felt like the blood was rising back up in my throat, trying to escape.
Please, I begged, don’t throw up.
Suddenly, my abdomen hitched and I felt the contents of my stomach hurtle up my throat towards my mouth. The man holding me felt it too, because he tightened his grip, locking my mouth shut around the funnel. He shoved a finger to block the hole just as blood and half-digested buffalo burger rocketed into my mouth. With no exit, the mixture of bile and blood exploded out of my nostrils like gory fireworks.
I choked and struggled to breathe, my nose burning with stomach acid. I squeezed my watering eyes shut and forced myself to swallow the vomit back down. My body screamed in protest and I let out another gooey burp, traces of stomach bile leaking from the corners of my mouth.
Suddenly, the funnel was removed and I fell forward onto my hands, gasping for air. I took a few steady breaths, testing my body, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. Tears leaked down my face from the revolt my body had put up.
Well, I thought, the easy part is over…
I crawled back to my knees, still sucking in the hot air, feeling my stomach gurgle. The Word was sitting again, his figure motionless. Kent and Bradly were standing on his right, watching me with intensity. I looked toward my family and my wife offered me a secret smile. My youngest gave me a small thumbs-up, a grin plastered across his little face.
“The Blood of the Goat is now your own,” The Word boomed from his throne, “for change starts on the inside, and from the inside, one can change anything he desires.”
He motioned to the man in the black hood.  “Thomas, you have ingested His blood, filling your mind and heart with His warmth. Now, reflect on these miracles as you transform into his image.”
I gritted my teeth as the man in the white hood held me still again. Black Hood reached into the chest and I shut my eyes, preparing for the miracle. I felt my lips tremble and I bit down on them. I needed to be strong. My family was watching.
Black Hood grabbed my right arm and began sawing it off at the elbow.
I screamed, eyes bulging, as pain exploded like thunder. My arm convulsed as the muscles were severed from bone, the hacksaw chewing through my skin and spraying blood across my face. The corners of my vision blackened as the saw screeched across bone, sending lightning bolts of pain charging across my body.
And then it was over. I fought to maintain consciousness, the agony unbearable. White Hood didn’t release his grip. I watched through bloodshot eyes as Black Hood set the bloody hacksaw down and pulled a blowtorch from the chest. A blue tongue of flame poked from the spout as he brought it to my squirting stump and began to cauterize the open skin.
I screamed even louder, the pain beyond anything I thought possible. Seconds later, I blacked out.
When I came to, head pounding and vision blurry, Black Hood was cutting off my other arm. After he sliced the last strip of skin from my new stump, my mind went dark again. The world swam, red-colored and air hot. I was on my back, White Hood staring down at me. He gently slapped my face, rousing me from the nightmare darkness. I blinked at him and tried to speak, but the words died in my throat.
White Hood looked up and told Black Hood to keep going, that I was okay. I wanted to see my wife’s face.  I wanted her to tell me the pain would end soon. I knew it was going to be bad, but this was excruciating, far worse than I ever imagined. I tried to block it out, telling myself that it was almost over, that this is what I wanted. Black Hood began to saw my legs off, the blade spewing through my flesh, just above the knees.
I passed out in a torrent of misery and pain, my howls dying in the air.
I coughed up a mouthful of mucus and blood as I regained consciousness. My body was a furnace of agony. Something itchy was covering my face. My vision was limited. Heat. My limbs felt funny. Someone was talking, a voice muffled by my dream-like state. I wanted to throw up. My head felt like it had been stuffed with burning coals.
I tried to climb to my hands and knees, blinking the darkness away, but something wasn’t right and I fell back down. I shook my head and felt hands grip me and gently pull me up. I shook my thundering head, the black pulling away from my vision like a spider web.
Metal hooves had been screwed into my elbows and knees, my body slumped and weak as I stood on all fours. The transformation was complete. I had done it. The itchy mask covering my face must be the skin of a goat, my eyes now seeing out of the empty eye sockets. I felt my head was bare and guessed they had already shaved it and implanted the horns in my skull with a hot knife.
I steadied myself on my new limbs, my hooves clacking against the cement floor. My body shook with effort, my muscles weak and exhausted. I ground my teeth and forced myself to stay upright. I could feel the goat horns digging into my skull. The skin pulled over my face smelled like rot and scraped against my cheeks like sandpaper.
The Word stood and I suddenly noticed there were more people in the room than before. Well… ‘people’ was a stretch. To the right of The Word were the thirty-two who had come before me, the thirty-two who had gone through what I had, and failed. They shuffled where they were, heads held low to the ground.
A herd of unworthy goats.
Their hooves shot echoes across the walls, an array of once-human-beings just like I had been. Men, women, all with goat faces pulled over their own, horns jutting from their bare heads, downcast with shame. Leashes were tied to collars around their throats, the ends of which were held by Kent and Bradly.
The Word leaned forward on his throne, assessing the state I was in. White Hood and Black Hood were planted on either side of me, arms crossed. I stared straight ahead, doing my best to stay upright.
“Well done, Thomas,” The Word said finally. A smattering of claps rounded the room, the Execs in suits nodding their approval. My wife had tears running down her cheeks and a smile that shone like the sun. My kids were slapping their palms together in awe at my resolution.
The Word waited for the room to silence. When it calmed, his voice became deadly somber.
“The rest is up to you now. You know the words?”
I nodded, feeling the weight of my new horns pressing my chin to the floor. I worked my jaw so I could see properly out of the eye holes of the goat skin. Almost there, I thought, I’ve almost done it.
The Word leaned back on his throne, scanning the room with unseen eyes, “This is it my friends. Not a word will be spoken during this time. Thomas needs complete silence and total focus. I think we can afford him that, yes?” He turned his covered head to me, “When you’re ready.”
The two Hoods backed away against the far wall and the red light above us dimmed. I noticed now that the scarlet symbols beneath my hooves were glowing. Candles lined the edges to form a circle.
I took my place at the center of the Pentagram.
I closed my eyes, concentrating my mind. I pushed all thoughts from my brain, emptying my head. I focused on breathing, on the heat that swirled around me. I saw the red light filtering through my eyelids and let it dance behind my eyes. Sweat and blood dripped off my new face and fell to the floor. My limbs screamed in their new form, but I silenced the tormented flesh.
I drew in a long breath, and then spoke, my voice strong and determined:
“Dear Father, Lord God of the Goat, I come before you, not as Thomas, but as one of your flock. I have cast aside my worldly form. I long to be one with you. I have consumed the holy blood.  I have whittled my body to mirror your Holy Image. I am yours, my life, my love, my future, my suffering. I beg you to return to the earth and lead us into glorious paradise. We stand ready, humbled, and in awe of you. I have displayed my undying devotion to you and my desire to follow in your footsteps. I pray of you, please, return to us now and lead us into your kingdom!”
As the last of my plea left my mouth, the room shook slightly and a soft cry went up from the bystanders. Their eyes went wide and they looked around at one another, mouths agape.
My heart pounded in my chest as the Pentagram flared and blood began to seep from the edges. I couldn’t believe it. This has never happened before, not a single person had conjured any kind of reaction.
The herd of human goats looked up at me with shock and awe, their eyes bulging under their masks. The Word stood, his hands gripping the armrests of his throne as the floor quivered beneath us. The light flickered above and a few of the candles went out, a sudden wind stirring the air.
I shuffled my hooves on the floor, trying to keep upright as the quake continued, blood pooling from the symbols around me. Even through the pain, I felt a smile creep across my face. I always knew I could do it. My wife had her arms around our boys, a look of utter amazement plastered to her face.
And then commotion ceased.
The ground solidified beneath me and the red light stopped flickering, returning to its constant warm glow. The dust froze in the air and then gently wafted back to the ground, the wind leaving as quickly as it had come. I watched in horror as the Pentagram sucked the blood back into its borders and the glow faded.
And we were left in silence.
“No, no we were so close!” The Word roared suddenly. “What did we do wrong!? What did we do?!”
The Execs cast their eyes to the ground, devastating disappointment leaking from every face. Kent and Bradly shook their heads at me, frowns pulling their mouths to the floor.
“WE WERE SO CLOSE!” The Word continued to scream, “WE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONE! WHAT DID WE DO WRONG!?”
Kent raised his hands defensively.  “Sir, we followed the bloodline down to him. We were sure it was the right line. We’ve narrowed it down so much.  It has to be him!”
The Word waved a hand at me from under his robe.  “I’m disgusted by the sight of you. Someone get him out of my sight! Put him in the pens out back with the rest of them!”
“No!” I shouted suddenly.  “No, let me try again! I can do this, I know I can! Please!”
Black Hood was grabbing me, dragging me back and away from The Word, growling to shut up. I felt something clasp around my throat and I was suddenly jerked forward.
I had been leashed.
No, NO!
“Please, just give me another chance! I’m the one! I know I’m the one! I CAN DO THIS!”
Black Hood kicked me into line along with the rest of the goats. They were streaming out the side door, pulled along by their own leashes as White Hood led them out of the Goat Room.
Just as I was about to be pushed through the door, The Word turned to me, an arm raised.
“Wait a moment. We weren’t wrong…we had the right bloodline…”
He turned to my eldest son, “Just the wrong person.”
I thrashed against my leash, screaming, “No, he’s not ready for this! HE’S NOT READY FOR THIS! GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY SON!”"	8.79	14.0	Elias Witherow	10/28/2020
My Therapist Wants Me to Kill Myself	"“Maybe the world would be better off without you.”
These were words I never expected to hear from my therapist. Up to that point, she had always been on my side, despite the many flaws that made up my character. I had fleeting thoughts of suicide, but it was never something I intended to act upon. Sharing them with Dr. Covenwood was usually a comfort; something that her soothing voice and wisdom could easily dispel. Reciprocation never even occurred to me.
“What?” I asked in confusion.
She reached into her desk and pulled out a pamphlet, of which she handed to me.
“People don’t understand you, Jack. You’re special. Let them live here in their ignorance. There’s a better place for you. It’s time to move on.”
It was a brochure of sorts. “Next World” was a paradise of the afterlife, equipped with a beautiful, otherworldly charm and happy community that put even heaven to shame. At least, that’s what the pictures and descriptions made it seem like. I was baffled but intrigued.
“What is this?” I asked.
“This is your solution. A place where you can live without fear or worry.”
She pulled out an envelope from the drawer and emptied it into my free hand. It contained a sharp, silver utensil.
“Leave tonight, Jack. Use this to do it. The portal will be opened, and you will travel into the next world. Trust me. It’s for the best.”
Dr. Covenwood never looked so serious, but she didn’t need to. Between my admittedly fractured psyche and the intense trust we developed over the years, I had an unhealthy attachment to her. Whatever she told me to do, I did without question. She could have told me to jump off the nearest bridge to my death and I would have, just to appease her. I was a broken man.
“Okay… If you say so.”
No further words were spoken. She simply gestured for me to leave and then turned around in her chair, facing the wall. I would be lying if I said our strange conversation hadn’t shaken me, but I still agreed to her terms and left, once again putting my life in her hands. Rational thinking was a luxury I hadn’t had in many years.
* * * * * *
That night, in a zombie-like stupor, I prepared. I sent the appropriate, vague, goodbye messages to what family I had and sent my pet cat Harvey outside to roam free with the strays in the area. With that, I ventured to my bedroom, turned the lights off, laid down in bed, and got to it.
I’ll spare you the details of the act itself. Just know that it was far from pleasant.
Whilst lying there in a pool of warm liquid, waiting for my eternal slumber, I noticed something. My vision was beginning to blur, but I could see a figure at the foot of the bed. It was a man, cloaked in darkness; a shadowy statue painted into the room by an unseen brush. A single ray of moonlight outlined his form, allowing me a glimpse at some of his features. He had gray hair and looked to be around fifty years of age. Covering his body, a suit you might see in the closet of an esteemed professor. Across his face, a wicked grin that stretched from ear to ear. Though on the verge of death, I was still frightened, jarred by his presence.
The pounding in my chest was the only movement I could muster in my wounded state. I was forced to watch in agony as the man turned his head upward and opened his lips as wide as humanly possible. From his eyes and mouth, a white light was expelled into the ceiling. The blast broke through the roof and more than likely cut a hole in the night sky. The house around us shook, and all at once, our environment transformed. I was no longer lying in bed. I was now in a white room, healed of my self-inflicted scars.
In pulling myself to my feet, I surveyed my surroundings. Before me was a white table; behind it, two doors on either side. Standing opposite me was the man, his head still tilted. The light had now dissipated. After a moment or two, he lowered his gaze to meet mine and smiled.
“Sorry to scare you. It was necessary for the transition. Please, take a seat.”
The man motioned for me to sit at the table. I obliged, but remained cautious. He sat down across from me.
“We are here to determine eligibility. Normally, when a mortal is killed with a Next World artifact, they move on without issue. However, when it is done deliberately to oneself, a judgment is needed to complete the process. Make sense?”
I was amazed. Dr. Covenwood was speaking the truth. The next world was real, and I was ready to take my place inside; hopeful for a better existence.  I nodded.
“Good. We can begin.”
The man handed me a blank sheet of paper and a fountain pen.
“Answer truthfully. The paper will know if you’re lying.”
To my astonishment, questions appeared on the page. I would write out my response, the ink would vanish, and the next query would present itself. Some were normal, asking for mundane personal information, while others probed for answers about my actions in deeply strange scenarios, such as, “If given the choice, would you rather have your skin removed, or your soul?” It felt like an exam I could never have studied enough for. When all was said and done, I handed the paper over. The man put on a pair of old-fashioned spectacles and looked it over, as if what I wrote was still there.
“Oh, dear. This is not good. Not good at all.”
I looked at him, perplexed.
“What’s wrong?” I asked.
“You were referred by one Elizabeth Covenwood?”
“Yes,” I said, “Is there an issue?”
“Well, Dr. Covenwood has recently been brought to our attention for violating one of our sacred rules. She’s what we call a collector.”
I was confused.
“Collector?”
“Yes. She’s sent many a patient to the next world, in hopes of easing their pain. Collectors are usually malevolent by nature; killing the innocent with our artifacts and feeding off of the energy expelled from the act. She’s different. Her intentions are morally sound, but her actions still conflict with our code of conduct. She’s even gone so far as to pass around non-sanctioned, printed material revealing privileged information about this place, as I’m sure you’ve seen.”
“What does this mean, exactly?” I asked.
The man bore a heavy look of disappointment.
“Unfortunately, given the unique circumstances of your departure from earth, you are considered non-eligible for residency in the next world. You will now be escorted to the other world instead.”
“Other world? Where’s that? Will I be okay?”
The man offered no reply or consolation. Within a matter of seconds, I was lifted from my seat by an unseen force and pinned to the surface of the table. The man stood up from his chair and pulled a strange-looking dagger out from within his jacket. I tried to break free, but it was no use. The sharp point gently caressed my skin, forming an X on my torso, just below the heart. In a flash, I was lifted again, and then pushed into the door at the right-hand side of the room. It was swiftly shut behind me.
I turned back, but the door was gone. Around me, an endless black void. I ran, desperate to find even a sliver of light in the darkness. This endeavor was unfruitful. No direction offered any dissonance. The only thing that broke up the landscape was the occasional shadow in the corner of my eye, slightly darker than the canvas behind it. I would glance over in an attempt to catch it in my field of view, but it was too fast. Before I knew it, I was pinned in place again, sprawled out on the floor beneath me.
Shadowy figures loomed overhead. With them came voices. Three distinct whispers in the dark.
VOICE 1: It’s different than the rest.
VOICE 2: You say that about every human.
VOICE 1: They’re all different.
VOICE 3: Shall we learn from it?
VOICE 2: I’ll prepare the fragmentor once the examination is complete.
VOICE 3: Why do we even bother with that thing? They can’t die here. It’s just torture.
VOICE 2: Don’t forget your training. Anguish is the energy that powers the next world. It is the payment we make in exchange for studying these creatures.
VOICE 3: I suppose that makes sense.
VOICE 1: Who would like to make the first incision?
VOICE 3: May I, Overseer? It would be my first.
VOICE 1: If you slip, its form will fragment too early and we will have to wait a thousand years for it to reconstitute.
VOICE 2: I can’t even begin to fathom what this type of being would experience in that time.
VOICE 3: I’m aware of the risk. I believe I am ready.
VOICE 1: Very well. You may begin.
One of the shadows reached for me. I screamed as loud as my lungs would permit. The fear had fully set in. I no longer wished to be dead. This was not what I signed up for when I pushed that silver metal into my flesh. I was blindly fulfilling Dr. Covenwood’s wishes; that much is true. Still, I secretly hoped the afterlife would offer me some solace. A peaceful existence, free from the thoughts and memories that plagued me back on earth. This was something far more sinister. A truth I never wanted to know.
Before the shadow could make contact, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
* * * * * *
Faint voices filled the room.
“He’s lost too much blood.”
I was in and out of consciousness for a while.
“Should we get the paddles?”
My vision was fuzzy. There were forms around me, but I could not make out anything discernible.
“He’s back! We have to keep going!”
I couldn’t hold on any longer. I had no choice but to succumb to the weariness and drift off.
* * * * * *
I came to in a brightly lit room. It was spinning, but eventually stopped, revealing its design. It was a hospital room. I looked down and saw bandages all over me, covering the marks I had made with the tool Dr. Covenwood gifted me. It seemed I was somehow alive.
Was it all a nightmare?
A nurse came in to greet me.
“Good! You’re up. You’re one lucky man. We nearly lost you, last night. It’s a good thing we have some of the best doctors in the world at this hospital.”
I offered a half-smile.
“This is going to sound strange, but can you please tell me… I am alive, aren’t I? This isn’t… the afterlife?”
She chuckled.
“No, of course not. You survived your injuries, but just barely. I guess that means you’re stuck here with us for a while longer.”
She smiled, but then bore a look of concern.
“It’s not my place to bring this up, and you don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, but I have to ask. Your wounds looked sporadic and uncontrolled, which is common with these types of cases. So…”
She hesitated.
“Yes?” I asked.
She let out a sigh before resuming her query.
“I really shouldn’t pry, but… why did you carve an X into your chest?”"	9.27	15.0	Christopher Maxim	10/22/2020
My Father’s Secret Room	"It had been wracking my brain for months. What exactly did he keep in there? Why was he being so secretive?
Even when I was younger, my father was more than happy to share his work with me at the dinner table. I listened intently, fascinated by the projects his biotech lab was working on. I didn’t understand most of the jargon, but that’s probably why he was so willing to reveal the hidden truths of the trade. He knew I wouldn’t retain enough to be a liability.
But then there’s the room.
It was an extension of his bedroom; one that was built when we moved in so he could do some of his work from home. Its secrets were locked behind a cast-iron door, and no matter how many times I asked, my father would not divulge what he described as being, “classified research.” Eventually, I stopped nagging him about it.
That brings us to the other day.
My father woke me at 6:30 am sharp for my weekly blood draw. It was something he started last year as a precaution. Knowing the dangers he potentially brought home each day, he felt the need to check in and make sure I hadn’t been infected with one of the many strains of harmful bacteria he worked with. Up to that point, I was in tip-top shape. No issues since the day he started. This day, however, broke the streak.
My dad went to his secret room, ran his usual tests on my blood, and raced back to see me, startled by an alarming discovery. My blood had been tainted by something, as he described it. He assured me there was nothing to worry about; he would just need to go in to work to run some more scans and get second opinions on the data. He promised to be back before dinner.
With that, he rushed out the door, clearly rattled by his findings.
When dinner time rolled around and he wasn’t home, I became a bit worried and called him. He answered and said there were more tests to be performed, but everything was looking good. He told me to cook one of the microwave meals in the freezer and not to wait up, as he would be late arriving home. I did as he instructed and got ready for bed. That’s when an idea sprung to mind.
I had attempted to open my father’s secret door on many occasions, to no avail. There were two deadbolts in place, as well as a run-of-the-mill padlock. Without the three separate keys needed to unlock it, it was a fruitless endeavor. Still, it was fun to try and imagine the wonders that would await me upon potentially opening it. It was the fuel that sparked many of my daydreams over the years.
As I so often did when he wasn’t home, I ventured into his bedroom and walked over to the mysterious door. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised to see the deadbolts undone. The only thing standing between me and my dad’s classified research was the cheap lock hanging at the door’s handle. He must have left in such haste that he didn’t feel the need for redundancy; sure I wouldn’t be prowling about his room while he was at the lab. Curiosity was a far stronger feeling than he knew.
Knowing this would be my only chance, I got to work. Using wire-cutters and a thin, metal coat hanger, I constructed a makeshift lock-pick. Shaking it within the keyhole, however, was not rewarding. I only succeeded in twisting the pick into a pretzel-like form, rendering it useless. Disappointed, I knew what had to be done. It was time for plan B.
I felt somewhat foolish as I hurried out in the darkness to our garden in the back yard. As I picked up a sizable stone and headed back in, my father’s trust in me was broken, and he would soon know. My prize would have to be worth the damage, because there was no way I could hide or explain away a busted lock. But the allure of whatever it was that lurked within his room had such a strong pull that I almost didn’t care. The need to see its contents far outweighed the fear of impending punishment.
Once inside and back at the iron door, I looked down at the rock in my hand. I now had the power to solve the mystery, and I was elated. With a couple of vicious swings, the lock gave in to the force and fell to the floor below. My heart was racing as I slowly pulled the door open and peered inside, astonished. It was a truly marvelous sight.
Inside my father’s room was a plethora of tanks, wires, and devices; all of which looked to be lab-issued in design. Certainly not anything I had ever seen in a retail setting. Within the tanks, a blue, neon liquid, with pockets of air bubbling to the surface; each with its own unique creature. Some were fused together; others had too many eyes or appendages. One in particular that caught my attention was a fox-like rodent with transparent fur and skin, granting me a glimpse at the inner workings of its body. A close second favorite would have to have been a fiery orange bird the size of my palm with iridescent wings. All of these living marvels were suspended in animation, locked in a peaceful slumber behind their glass.
The oddities in the room had far exceeded my expectations. My dad was creating new life, fathering a new era not only in his field, but in Mother Nature. These animals had the potential to deeply alter the face of Earth’s wilderness. Perhaps they even had the power to benefit the world’s ecosystem as a whole. I was so very proud of him.
As I gazed at my father’s work in awe, I noticed something. In the center of the room was another tank, larger than the rest, covered by a completely opaque, black sheet. This must have been his pride and joy; a creature that stood out in a way the others couldn’t. A magic he must have captured so brilliantly, that he didn’t even want to look at it himself for fear of being distracted, transfixed by its appearance.
Excited, I was compelled to dislocate the sheet from the tank. In doing so, I was mortified.
Behind the glass was a human, but only a portion of one. It was a head and partial torso, cut off just below the chest. New cells were being replicated at a steady pace, slowly completing its shape. With its increasingly rapid rate of regeneration, it looked as though it might be in a walking state by week’s end.
It being human didn’t trouble me so much. It was the face. My face. This project of my dad’s was a clone. A living, breathing copy of my DNA.
Unsettled, I couldn’t help but stare. Even the minutest detail was accurate, down to the individual hairs floating above its scalp. I was no longer enamored with my father’s room. My stomach had turned to such a degree, that I felt as though I had become sick. Then, the strangest thing happened.
My clone opened its eyes.
On either side of its nose were black ellipses, the likes of which I had never seen on a face before. After its eyelids receded, the mouth opened and I was accosted by a muffled, but frightening shriek. Its incomplete form thrashed about wildly. I ran away as fast as I could, the sound of glass shattering behind me. I foolishly forgot to close the door, too preoccupied with my own survival. I looked back once while running and saw the horrifying sight of a dark-eyed version of me from the chest up, floating through the house to my position.
I left as quickly as possible and sprinted into the trees towards my father’s lab. Coming from the direction of my home, a terrifying symphony of unnatural screams filled the forest.
* * * * * *
The facility where my father worked, as well as our home, was located along a dirt road in the woods. Moonlight soaked the path, granting me ample visibility to make my way there. My trek was met with the eerie soundscapes of the forest, including the occasional far off outburst from my copy, who I knew must have been gaining on me. Having legs was an advantage. My pace never wavered, and I was able to reach the lab within the hour.
Before venturing over to the entrance, I surveyed my surroundings. The unsavory sounds of midnight animals filled the air around me; the outcries of wolves, predatory birds, and bears. These, however, were not what I was listening for. Once certain that my copy hadn’t followed me, I used the speaker box to communicate with the receptionist. Luckily, the response was immediate.
“How can we help you?”
“Hi. This is Garrett’s son. I really need to see my dad.”
There was a brief pause before I received a reply.
“One moment.”
I waited patiently, but nervous. As I stood there, my ears were met with a familiar, inhuman sound, reverberating off of the trees at the edge of the clearing. It was closing in.
“What are your full name, date of birth, and social security number?”
I was beginning to panic, but was able to provide the information requested.
“Thank you. One moment.”
The horrific sound was no longer distant. It grew louder as I watched the grotesque form of my clone floating up the path, coming towards me. My breathing became sporadic, as did my heart rate.
“You’ve been approved. You may enter at the sound of the buzzer.”
I quickly opened the door and entered the building, slamming it shut behind me. My other self did his best to charge at the closed door, but was unable to penetrate its thick, metal layers. I was finally safe.
At the front desk, the receptionist offered a greeting and pointed me in the direction of the next floor where my father’s office was located. I thanked him and headed off upstairs.
The second floor of the lab was a labyrinth; red carpet and identical white doors weaving in and out of the dimly lit hallways. I tried turning the knob on the first door I saw, which belonged to Room 371. It was locked.
“Hello? Is there anyone in there? I’m looking for my father.”
A man opened the door for me and sat down at his desk. The room wasn’t anything special; some work stations with a plant and waste bin in the corner. No sign of my father. I tried conversing with the man who let me in, but he ignored me completely. His strange demeanor and zombie-like state were unsettling. Unable to get any answers out of him, I left. The door was swiftly shut behind me.
The other rooms were exactly the same. I tried dozens of them. There was always a single worker inside – all of whom ignored my presence. The closest I came to a conversation was one of them trembling, muttering to themselves, This isn’t worth the paycheck. After that, I stopped knocking on doors altogether and simply wandered the hallways. It seemed there was a rule against speaking to outsiders.
Just as I was about to go back down to the receptionist and ask for directions, I saw a door at the end of one of the halls, unlike the rest. It was white, but instead of a room number, there was a plaque affixed to its surface.
Dr. Garrett Covenwood
Head of Operations
That was it! My dad’s office.
I waltzed over and knocked on the door.
“Dad? It’s me. I made a mistake. I really need to talk to you.”
There was no response. Fortunately, the door was unlocked. I gently turned the knob and pushed it open, revealing the inner sanctum of my father’s workplace. Another area I had always wanted to see; one that I constructed many times in my imagination. Unlike the secret room at home, his office was entirely normal.
There was more red carpet and plain, white walls. A single desk was perched in the corner, complete with a computer and piles of paperwork. On the opposite side were a filing cabinet and a few chairs. That was it. It was as ordinary and mundane as it could possibly be, but I was not disappointed. My only goal was to tell my dad about the copy and hope he would know what to do.
I scoured the room in hopes of finding a phone to call him with. There wasn’t one. Instead, I discovered a strange, red button protruding from the side of his desk. In pressing it, something unexpected happened.
I watched, amazed, as the far wall of my dad’s office opened up and slid into the corner, governed by an unseen mechanical interface. Behind it was a long, brightly lit tunnel. Upon crossing the threshold, I noticed several tanks lined up along the walls, similar to the ones back home. Inside them; more copies of me, suspended in bubbling liquid. I was, once again, mortified.
I couldn’t fathom what my dad was doing or why. I wracked my brain for answers, but none came. Before I could contemplate the matter any further, I noticed something. There was an opening at the end of the tunnel. Just before it was a final tank on the right wall, numbered 2263. The glass was broken and its contents had been emptied.
I raced over to the opening and found a room filled with computers and various electronic hardware. There, lying in the center of the room, was my father, his lower half in a pool of blood.
I ran to his side and turned him over, tears wetting my face. He was still breathing, but barely. He managed to open his eyes and smiled upon seeing me.
“I thought I… I thought I told you not to wait up for me.”
I smiled, but continued to cry.
“I’m so sorry. I broke into your room and let out that thing. I didn’t know what to do.”
He coughed. My eyes scanned his body and identified a gash at his lower abdomen. I applied pressure as best I could.
“It’s okay. There are some things I need to tell you before I go. Please listen carefully.”
I wiped the tears away with my arm and nodded in agreement. What I heard changed my whole life.
“As you know, your mother died during childbirth. I was never the same after that.”
He coughed some more. I applied more pressure, hoping that it would keep him alive.
“What I never told you was that you died too. The birth was premature and the complications that arose were too much for your fragile form. You never made it out of the operating room.”
I bore a look of shock and confusion, almost gasping as he spoke.
“I couldn’t save your mother, but I thought I could save you, at least in some fashion. It was the only thing that kept me from losing my sanity after her death. I extracted the stem cells from your body and used them here to make more of you. Clones.”
“Clones?” I asked, “But why?”
“I couldn’t bear the thought of being without the two of you. Saving you was my only hope. Unfortunately, there were side effects that came with the methods we used.”
He let out another loud cough. Blood dripped from his mouth.
“All of the clones gained unforeseen abilities. This affected their temperament and caused them to lash out. Each and every model went haywire within a day. You were our most successful attempt.”
“You mean… I’m a clone?”
I could barely get the words out.
“Yes. But your vitals are the same as your predecessors. In addition to their vicious behavior, all of the previous versions of you become comatose within three months’ time. That’s when we place them back in their tanks, where they remain in an eternal slumber. With the tests I ran today on the prototype at home, I thought I had solved it. I tried the antidote on one of the clones here at the lab. It backfired.”
Blood seeped out from behind my hands. No amount of pressure could stop it.
“I was able to wake it up, but it grew wilder than the rest. It had abilities the others didn’t and used them to attack.”
“How long have I been alive? How much time do I have left?”
He coughed some more. I wasn’t sure he would even be able to respond.
“You have one more week. You all have neural implants. That’s how I was able to give you your memories.”
I was saddened by the news, but it was strangely relieving to know the truth. My father looked up at me one last time. The blood was now pouring from his wound.
“I hope you can forgive me. I love you so mu…”
His eyes went blank and his head fell in my arms. He was gone.
I sat there for a long time and cried over my father’s lifeless body. Even if I was only three months old and equipped with fabricated memories, he was the only family I ever knew. Even if it wasn’t a real relationship, I loved him.
As I wept, footsteps echoed in the distance. I turned to see the full-bodied clone that had broken free from the tunnel, standing at the edge of the room. His eyes were dark and his mouth opened at an unnatural angle. He let out a shriek that pierced my very soul and struck fear into my racing heart.
I had to escape, but how?
* * * * * *
I stood to meet its horrific gaze. Terrified and without many options, I tried conversing with it.
“Hello. Can you see me with those eyes of yours? I’m just like you. We’re family, in a sense.”
It tilted its head in curiosity. I cautiously walked towards it.
“It’s okay. I’m not here to hurt you. I was created, just as you were. We are the same, you and me.”
My heart was pounding hard as I closed the gap between us.
“See? There isn’t anything to be frightened of. I’m your friend.”
Now inches apart, I put my haphazard plan in motion. Without giving it a second thought, I pushed my clone aside with a great deal of force and rushed out of the tunnel and into my father’s office. It screamed a sickening cry and ran to me. Eventually, I no longer heard its feet touching the floor. I turned to see it levitating in my direction, just like the unfinished prototype before it.
I ran out of my dad’s office and navigated the maze of halls with sheer luck, successfully making it down the stairs and to the first floor. I called out for the receptionist to help me, but he was not at his post. It seemed I was on my own.
In a flash, I yanked open the front door and stumbled out into the cool, night air. There on the path, waiting for me, was the prototype, still floating above the earth. I dashed to my right and took off into the trees, desperately hoping the shrubbery would hide me to some extent. It was no use. I looked back to see both clones, honed in on my position, both flying into the forest. There was no way I could outrun them.
Thinking quickly, I developed a theory. Their eyes were void of color. I thought of the exchange I had with the clone in my dad’s office. It was a long shot, but I carefully took cover behind a tree, walking as softly as I could manage. The clones followed suit, but dispersed at my last position, seemingly unaware of my whereabouts. They split up in an effort to find me.
My theory was proven correct. They were blind; only able to react to sound. That’s how they were able to navigate the forest in the dark. If I was quiet, I thought, I might be able to leave unnoticed.
Putting as little weight as possible into each of my steps, I made my way to another tree, then another. I repeated this process until I accidentally stepped onto a fallen branch, creating a loud crack that rang through the woods. My cover was blown. Within a matter of seconds, the two clones caught up to me and readied themselves for an attack. I was out of breath and energy; unable to run anymore. There would be no escaping them now.
This was it. My final moments. Knowing I only had a week left anyway, I wasn’t all that bothered. The only thing that kept me scared was the thought of what these foul creatures would unleash upon me. They had abilities unknown to the natural world. Seeing the agony my father went through when he passed, it was safe to assume I was in for a great deal of anguish at the hands of my other selves.
I closed my eyes for the impending torment. That’s when a fleeting thought bubbled to the surface.
If I was a clone, just like them, did I have powers too?
I opened my eyes and just barely had time to dodge a red stream of liquid that shot from the prototype’s mouth. It met the tree at my side and incinerated its bark clean off. The other clone extended its arm and turned its hand in a circular motion. The space around us seemed to bend, making my vision blur. I was inflicted by hallucinations, the likes of which I never want to experience again. Bound by this power, the visions, at the time, felt all too real.
I was standing in a white room in a hospital. From what I could tell, doctors were scrambling to deliver a baby. I managed to catch a glimpse of the woman between the outline of their forms. It was my mother. I had only ever seen her in pictures, but I was certain it was her. This was the day I was born – or at least, when the actual me was born.
Her pained cries ricocheted off the walls and burrowed into my ears. After a moment or two, the sound abruptly stopped and the doctors dispersed, forming a path to the table. I hesitantly stepped over to it and was greeted by a terrible sight.
My mother was still, her eyes glazed over. Something was moving within her abdomen. It began clawing its way out, blood and organs spilling over onto the floor. A face appeared above the mess. It was one of the clones, its dark eyes cutting through my stare and shaking me to my core. It expelled a black smoke from its mouth that swirled around the room and filled my field of view. It then dissipated, transitioning to another scene.
I was now outside of my home, peering in through the window. My father and I were having dinner inside, laughing together, like we had on many nights before. A tear trickled down my cheek as I watched. Then, without warning, the version of me in the house turned to meet my gaze, its eyes consumed by a familiar darkness. It was the clone, still toying with me.
A wicked smile danced across its face as it stood up from the table and stepped over to my father, who was still laughing as if nothing had happened. All the while, it never turned away, our eyes still locked in a sickening stare.
I cried out, futilely.
The clone placed its hands on my father’s head. I struck the glass to warn him, but it was no use. His smile grew wider. I shut my eyes, not wishing to see what would come next. There was a loud crack followed by the thud of a body meeting the floor. I reluctantly opened my eyes to see the clone, right there at the window. I fell back in fear and hit my head on the unforgiving ground. The illusion was then broken.
I found myself back in the forest, pinned to the ground by an unseen force.
I had to act fast.
I tried to tap into whatever reservoirs of energy I possessed. The clones readied themselves. I saw the prototype open its mouth again. I would be a goner if not for what happened next.
Almost out of my control, I broke free of my restraints, releasing a wave of energy that propelled the copies deeper into the woods. I stood in an upright position and nervously awaited their return, still unsure of how to use my newfound abilities. Their screams bounced across the treeline. They appeared before me, their faces contorted in pure anger. With them, an armada of wildlife, deadly creatures that didn’t exist in any textbook. A bear the size of a house with grass-like fur, wolves with six legs and three eyes, human-sized bipedal rabbits, and a slew of others I had no time to examine. They must have been failed experiments from the lab.
They charged at me with blood-lust in their eyes. Using what seemed like a collective of telekinetic energy, I was hurled upward into the air. They gathered below and waited for me to fall to them. I helplessly flailed about while descending to what I thought would be my inevitable death. On my decent, something awoke within me. All at once, I stopped falling, and hung there in the night sky, facing the group below. Then, almost instinctively, I unfolded my arms and legs out in front of me. Something I can only describe as a loud, metallic creak was expelled from my mouth, while a glow left my skin and washed over the forest.
* * * * * *
I came to on the forest floor. The many lab experiments that once haunted me, including my clones, were scattered around, inanimate on the ground. There were colorful sparks dancing across their heads. Their neural implants must have short-circuited in the blast. They wouldn’t be chasing me again anytime soon.
As I strolled through the forest towards my home, I thought of my father. No matter how wrong he was in what he did, or how artificial my memories were, I still held him close to my heart. I would have to spend my last week of life mourning his death and finding a way to come to terms with everything.
I don’t know if I’m fit for an afterlife, so I can’t be sure I’ll ever see you again. Just know that I do forgive you and miss you terribly.
You will always be my father."	9.18	11.0	Christopher Maxim	10/19/2020
The Woman on Sticks	"Part I
How happy we are today
The feeling will only escape
No matter who we blame it on
When the thrill is gone, it’s gone, it’s gone
 – Trifonic
Warren Biggs thundered into the radio station that sat at the edge of town, the town itself sat at the edge of an expanse of cornfields mingled with six acres of woodland.
This was not his day. He arrived with his hands full (as usual) and cool weather had made the studio door lock uncooperative. First it wouldn’t take his key. Then it took it but wouldn’t let it go.
He had made it inside with only seconds to spare, fumbling his donuts against his paunch where the souls of many devoured donuts already languished. He caught his foot on the leg of a rolling chair that had been left out in the walkway four inches too many. Laws of physics determined that this would result in some spillage from his coffee, but just a few drops.
He sat down in front of the control board with a seismic thunk. Grabbing his headset caused the wire attached to it to pull his coffee into his lap where it spilled much more than a few drops in a place where there were much more than a few nerve endings. It was a howl that rattled the glass, but it was too early for anyone to be around to hear.
He switched on the obsolete equipment and gave it the obligatory waiting period that it needed to warm up.
He shook his head, hoping that his boss wasn’t doing a station performance audit. His boss wasn’t. So Warren’s morning DJ show hit the airwaves at 5:15 AM instead of the official 5:00 AM, an anomaly that wasn’t terribly uncommon.
With tears in his eyes from the spill of lava-hot java on his Oh Mama, he hit the ground in form when the ON AIR light went green.
“Good morning from the sticks of Stocksville! Pour the Joe and rock and roll, all you lovely dreamers and doers riding that early worm into the sunrise! DJ Warren Peace is gonna keep you warm on this chilly September day with the hottest tunes from the coolest artists, so stoke your fire and go get over the hump of today’s hump day! Go get what’s yours! Start a fire, start a fire, Start a fire!”
That was the part he lived for. By the third ‘start a fire,’ he was swinging one chubby arm in the air like he had a lasso. And then that cued the stretch where his failed career as a motivational speaker was replaced by music that got played through thin speakers in the back rooms of diners and employee lounges and motel lobbies and gas station bathrooms, songs that were veritable EVPs of people that had bought into the American Dream, gotten it, and likely lost it by the time anyone could attach their names to their songs. And now the ghosts of their success were rained down on a quiet town full of people that were too busy to think about the American Dream. All except for the teenagers. Teenagers are composed of nothing but dreams.
For a teenager to give up on their dreams would be tantamount to self-mutilation.
Teenagers like Jacob Pines, a lad who was sixteen and every bit the pretty boy that girls swooned over along with their moms. Oh, did Jacob ever have dreams. Most of them centered around getting the attention of the equally gorgeous Jane Corcorin. But like anyone else that bought into dreams, he didn’t think much on the discrepancy between the volume of his efforts vs. the results.
He could have been one of the faces that music producers take under their wing and manufacture into pop stars with zero talent. Jake didn’t know how to leverage his pretty boy-ness. He tried getting Jane’s attention by staring at her longingly, the way some boys can manage when they’re models in front of a camera. He just ended up looking like a creepy kindergartner sizing up a box of animal crackers. Not that it mattered. She didn’t notice.
He tried showing off for her in gym class. He was a capable athlete. He’d make the shots, the touchdowns, the winning points, but she never seemed to be paying attention during those critical moments. She always had that dreamy, faraway look to her, like she were in a perpetual state of being mentally absent, someplace where Jake’s peacock feathers couldn’t be seen.
People willing to listen to Jake moan about his girl problems were a rarity in his world. You’re not supposed to be prone to such things when you’re hot.
In spite of this, Ryan Lambert with his bowl cut, and poster-worthy dark eyes was able to reach into the depths of his utter lack of experience with girls and offer some good advice:
“Dunno, man. Maybe you’ll have to start with something she actually likes. Like, get into what she’s into.”
“Yeah? What’s she into?”
Ryan shrugged hard enough to pull his head into his jersey turtle-fashion.
“I don’t know nothin’ about her.”
And nobody did, really. Jake discovered this with his attempts at overhearing anything Jane might say about herself. The only time she ever talked was to answer the teacher’s questions to the class.
Desperation drove Jake to his boldest move yet.
The P.E. teacher’s shrill whistle pealed throughout the gym, signaling everyone to come out of the locker rooms, one pool of boys and one pool of girls, both groups in the gray shirts and blue shorts that marked them as being the property of Stocksville Middle School.
One of those groups was missing a member: Jacob Pines, who had hung back in the boys’ locker room. He slipped into the girls’ lockers when everyone was doing laps outside.
He knew what her binder looked like. Pink flowers against a darker pink background. He went through the lockers whose combo locks had been carelessly left open, hanging like hooks. He prayed that one of them was hers.
One of them was.
There were her clothes and her binder. He was so proud of himself. There had to be something about her… something, anything… inside that binder.
The binder was closed with a tiny lock. The kind that wouldn’t stand a chance against a screwdriver but that was more than a match for Jake’s paws.
He wasn’t proud anymore.
He resigned himself to the fact that Jane Corcorin was a safe he would never be able to crack. He put everything back in their places and he even managed to slip into the line of red-faced teens doing laps in the schoolyard.
Gym class ended and he changed his clothes and he sat with a vacant stare. He was gazing down the long tunnel of time at his future life where Jane couldn’t be seen.
The bell rang.
Jake was the last to file out. He turned the corner of the doorway and smacked right into Jane Corcorin, knocking her binder out of her hands and causing it to break its lock on the floor, sending the binder’s contents scattering. Jake became a little more religious in that moment.
“I’m so sorry,” he lied.
Her crystal blue eyes flashed at him before she shook her head.
“No-no, you’re fine,” she said as she started scooping up the sheer volume of papers that should not have been able to physically fit inside the dimensions of that binder.
He didn’t ask for permission to help her. He began shoveling papers and he found that mingled with her schoolwork were all manners of sketches and handwritten notes on monsters. Cryptids. Bigfoot, Mothman, The Jersey Devil, Black-Eyed Children, and so on.
But the bulk of the heap seemed to be devoted to the local monster. Some called it Pegleg Peggy. Others called it Sally Stilts. Stickwoman. It almost looked as if there were more drawings of Pegleg Peggy than there were sheets of schoolwork.
Jackpot, said Jake’s brain before the mound of papers he was holding were snatched away from him. Oh man, she was dead hot when she was mad. Her straight blonde hair seemed to flare out like the fur of an irritated cat.
“Thanks,” she said, effectively dismissing Jake from helping her salvage her valuables.
“Are you sure? I don’t mind help–”
“I said THANKS.”
He left her without a word and wearing his dumbest grin yet.

Part II
So tell me what part of no
Don’t you understand?
 – Lorrie Morgan
Jacob was disappointed to find that there just wasn’t much information about Pegleg Peggy on the internet. He could count on one hand how many pages there were in a Google search that contained scanned information, and none of them had any real artwork or pictures to speak of.
He was wanting to draw Jane a picture of her favorite monster. But it looked like he was going to have to go off of a simple crayon drawing that was uploaded by one author’s child, and whatever he could remember from the papers he saw in her binder. He guessed that most of those had been drawn by her. A true fangirl.
So he did the best that he could, going off of the vague descriptions of the creature that he found on the internet. An otherwise featureless human female torso, gaunt and emaciated from living a life in the wild, and with whatever limitations are brought on by having sticks for arms and legs. Perhaps it killed things by impaling them? It had a mouth that seemed to go from the bottom of one ear to the other, creating a long slit that allowed for it to open up extremely wide, almost like the way the jaw of a snake unhinges.
He gave it various injuries as you would associate with living in the wild with no medical treatment.  The final product didn’t look much better than the original children’s drawing that guided him. He too was using crayons. But he was pouring every romantic fiber he had into this picture, as if it were the one prize rose that would woo his beloved, if a rose could ever do such a thing.
It was finished. It was his most serious work of art since he was six. It was beautiful and she was going to love it. She would be so taken by his attention to detail and his realism with Crayola that she was bound to throw her arms around him and kiss him and confess her eternal love.
She wasn’t at school the next day.
Or the day after.
He boldly went to her house to deliver the picture in person. He didn’t know why he was so certain that she would be the one to answer the door. The door was answered instead by her mother, a beakish woman with eyes that were always wide and a cross around her neck large enough to nail Jacob to it.
“Can I help you?” she asked in a tone that said she didn’t want to help anyone.
“Hey, um. My name is Jacob. I’m just checking on Jane. She hasn’t been at school.”
She smiled. “Yes-yes-yes, the poor dear has been under the weather. Now how are you involved with my daughter?”
“Well, we’re classmates…”
“Yes-yes-yes, but how are you two involved?”
Jacob felt very uncomfortable.
“I mean we just talk about monsters and stuff. See, I drew her a picture of her favorite monster for a, uh… a project, and I was just hoping…”
The woman snatched for the drawing like a chicken goes for a fat grasshopper. She held the drawing aloft, crushed in her grasp.
“Jane Mallory Corcorin, you’re still taking communion with demons! DEMONS!”
The woman began speaking in tongues while citing scripture in English. She spun around like a dementia patient convinced that they were the Warner Brothers’ Tasmanian Devil. She saved the trail end of her babble for Jacob.
“…messenger from hell!” Slam.
A creeping dread settled into Jacob’s stomach. He had just started a fire, and this woman seemed every bit the type to deal with fires by flogging them or stretching them on a rack and demanding a confession.
He began walking home feeling awful.
How would he redeem himself from this one? He was walking past some garbage set out for collection when he noticed something pale and pink. The resident had set out a department store mannequin. It was just a head and a torso. He knew exactly what he was going to do. It was a shot in the dark, but white-hot teenage love takes those kinds of crapshoots.
It took a lot of duct tape and balancing, but there stood Pegleg Peggy on four sticks, her hair a mess but her body poised to strike whoever dared to enter her woodland. The mannequin was just the right size and shape and there was no shortage of tree branches littering the forest floor to make her arms and legs. An old mop supplied the monster’s hair. Instead of offering Jane a drawing, he would give her an authentic photograph. Taken by him. And he would be her hero. She would forget about how he accidentally outed her to her mother.
Maybe.
The more he thought about the whole thing, the more foolish he felt going to this length, but again… teenage love was about feeling, not thinking.
He was in the depths of the forest and positioned the fake cryptid and the camera so that the body was turned to a silhouette and the duct tape was thus hidden. He knew just enough about photography that he wanted to take at least a dozen or more shots and choose the best ones. He was also lazy and shot most of them from the same spot.
This had an unexpected result.
He spent the evening poring over the mostly identical pictures, deciding which ones to give Jane. Maybe he would use a cool filter on some and make them look like bloody movie posters.
He ended up including all the photos plus ones that he edited with effects. He put everything on a flash drive and looked at it like it was a magic ring that would cast a love spell on whoever wore it.

Part III
Tremble for yourself, my man,
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man,
You’ll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face,
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck…
– Mumford & Sons
 
Jane was back in school on Monday, looking nerve-worn and stressed. Jacob felt a pang of guilt when he saw her at her locker. He braced himself before going up to her and offering the flash drive.
“Hey,” he said.
She took one look at him and turned her back on him.
“Look I’m really sorry my drawing upset your mom.”
Jane turned around with eyes that were perfect circles.
“You mean that was you that came to my house?”
He hadn’t considered that her mom would have been too worked up to supply a proper description of the man that exposed the apparently underground interests of her daughter.
Jane looked fit to slug him. He wasn’t going to get the flowery lead-in that he had hoped for. So he went for it.
“I’ve got photos of Pegleg Peggy. They’re on this flash drive.”
She eyed the thing. Looked at him.
“I’ve never done anything to you. I don’t even know you. Why do you feel the need to make fun of me and wreck my life?”
“I’m serious! I took these pictures myself!”
“I don’t know you! Why are you doing this?” she said with tears forming translucent pearls in her eyes.
“I wanted to impress you!”
That got her attention. Was she going to throw her arms around him and kiss him? No. She just took the flash drive and looked it over. Looked at him the way a wild squirrel regards a hiker offering a peanut.
“What’s really on here?” she said.
“I told you. Pictures of Pegleg Peggy. I noticed that she’s your favorite…thing. That’s why I drew you a picture of her. I just wanted to impress you.”
You would have thought that he told her that he was trying to grow a third armpit.
“Just look them over and tell me what you think. My uh… phone number and email address are on there too.”
She took the drive and walked off without a word.
It wasn’t the scene from a modern romance novel that he had hoped for but it could have gone worse.
Now I would love to tell you that things went exactly as he had hoped after that. But nope. His email pinged with a message from JanePeg@famnet.net and his heart was shot down just as soon as it had taken to the sky.
It was a long, nasty, scathing message. To the effect that he must really think she’s stupid and he must really want her dead and really hate her.
He was going to make a hasty reply, but she had blocked his email address. That was it. He failed.
He didn’t eat dinner that night. Told everyone that his stomach was bothering him, which was partially the truth. He laid in bed but couldn’t nap. The sun went down but he couldn’t sleep. He just garnered what meager painkiller he could from the dopamine release of playing a game on his cell phone.
it was around midnight when his email pinged again. It was from Jane.
It simply read “We need to talk.” Beneath that terse line was an animated gif made up of the photos that Jacob had taken. He almost thought that she was making fun of him but he noticed something in the background of the gif. He had taken the pictures no more than two seconds apart, and the gif made it look like a cut from an amateur stop-motion film. Behind the fake Pegleg Peggy was the real thing. She was nestled in the leaves, mostly holding still, except to shift her weight on her sticks and to slowly stalk away, keeping her eyes on the camera until her neck wouldn’t turn.
He was beyond belief in that moment. Was it an act of God? Was Jacob really just such a G that he made things work out so well without knowing it?
Either way, he was gonna take it. He replied to her email and waited.
She was waiting for him in the cafeteria. The anger and the distrust were gone from her eyes.
“Hey,” he said.
“Hey,” she patted the spot on the table next to her.
He couldn’t hide how happy he was to sit next to her. She didn’t share the glow. Instead, she wore the look of an addict trying to hide their hunger for a fix.
“Can you show me where you took those pictures?”
“Sure can.”
“Do you still have the mannequin?”
He frowned internally. Why wasn’t she talking about dating?
“I took it home with me after I was done taking pictures. So yeah. Why?”
“Did you see the way that she acted? She wasn’t looking at you. She was looking at your mannequin. That was territorial behavior. If we set it up again, it could draw her out and we could get better pictures.”
She was looking intense, like something important hinged on her ideas.
“Will you be able to get away from your parents without getting in trouble?”
“Yes, don’t worry about that.”
So it was a date. She just didn’t know it or didn’t seem to care.

Part IV
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God’ll cut you down
Sooner or later God’ll cut you down
– Johnny Cash
Jacob waited in the exact same spot with his prize mannequin cryptid. He was grinning ear to ear and he felt amazing. It all seemed too good to be true. She was going to be here with him alone in the woods. He brought snacks and drinks. They were going to photograph a local legend and he was going to win her heart in the process. Perfect. So perfect.
He tried to suppress his anxiety when she took her time to show up. Part of him wondered if she had stood him up to get revenge. But there she came at long last, wearing nothing remarkable but looking stunning to him all the same. Her golden hair looked at home among the leaves that were changing colors into all the hues of Autumn.
Love in Fall. FALL-ing in love, he mused.
He grinned at her like an idiot.
“Hey,” she greeted without making eye contact. “Is the decoy set up yet?”
In about ten minutes they were ready. Faux Peggy was where she was the first time she succeeded. The two youths were poised with their equipment. Jacob made sure that they would be able to camp out long after dark, just not for the same reasons that Jane had in mind.
Jane looked like an over-prepared tourist who was lugging around half of a studio. She had her own camera, a laptop, plus her cell phone at the ready. Her face was stern like a grim Mona Lisa. A good hour passed before there was much talking. It was actually her that broke the silence as they two of them sat on a storm-fallen tree, leaves falling around them like snowflakes.
“This means everything to me,” she said rather matter-of-fact.
“I can tell,” Jacob said.
“I mean, this is my future. My mother thinks I want to be some kind of ghost chaser or demon hunter. If I can just show my mother that this thing is real and not some demon, I’ll be one step closer to doing what I want to do with my life. Hard evidence is the best argument, right?”
“Sure,” Jacob said as his hand started inching towards hers.
Her face scrunched slightly as if she were seeing a naked tarantula sneaking up on her. She looked at him.
“So what’s your favorite real-life monster?” she asked as she moved her hand to where her other one was.
“…Bigfoot?”
“Really?”
His eyes danced. “The Loch Ness Monster?’
She looked away to hide the smile that was coming on. He saw it. He couldn’t tell if it was due to amusement or ridicule, but it was a smile from her and he loved it.
“So what do you know about the monster we’re looking for right now? We’ll start there.”
“It’s been popping up around here for the last sixty years. I guess it eats children. When kids go missing, it gets blamed. The name, Pegleg Peggy is a reference to Peg Powler, a very old water spirit who is also said to eat children.”
That made her smile for real.
“You’ve done some research.”
“Yeah, just for this monster.”
“Just for me.”
He nodded. “Yeah, just for you.”
Was he dreaming, or did she finally look like she could actually tolerate his presence and possibly enjoy it?
“For me, there’s more to this than just leaving my mark in paranormal research. This monster speaks to me on some level. Somewhere in there, she’s human, but she’s altered. You’d think her chances of survival would be nada, but here she’s been a legend for decades. She’s surviving despite her odds. She hasn’t felt the need to ask for help. She’s obviously misunderstood, and I really, really identify with that…” and so the cork popped and Jane’s backlog of self-expression came spilling out.
The hours wore on and the two teens talked for most of it. Sometimes forgetting what they were there to do.
It got dark. It got cold. They didn’t really notice.
Jake woke up to the pitch black of the night, the sky retaining just enough twilight to contrast slightly with the canopy of leaves. He fumbled for the oil lantern with heavy, sleep-drugged hands. He lit it. Jane appeared next to him, passed out and snoring. He thought it was absolutely adorable.
Movement at the very edge of the lantern’s halo caught his attention. His heart nearly stopped beating.
“Jane! Jane! He hissed, shaking her with one hand. She awoke with a start.
“What? What? What’s happening?” she said, and then she saw it half a second later.
Just past the fake Pegleg Peggy was the real one. She had been studying the decoy, but the lantern got her attention. Her movements resembled a praying mantis sizing up a potential meal. She creaked side to side on her sticks in a hypnotic rhythm. Her red eyes had a fire to them, as if they would glow if the lantern went out. Jane’s hands went to her face. Jake had the presence of mind to start recording with his camera on the tripod. Jane seemed to have forgotten all about her own equipment.
She stood up. The monster didn’t back up, but her shoulders crept up next to her ears like a shrinking cat. Jake got up with the lantern and held it high, casting the horrid appearance of ‘Peggy’ into even sharper clarity.
She looked like she spent her years being used as a dartboard, covered in cuts and scrapes and festering wounds. The yeasty stink of pus reached the teens. She was awfully thin, both from hunger and from wiry strength. The filthy hair hung straight down, and the movements of the head had an almost reptilian way about them. Especially clear was the mouth. A slit that ran from under one earlobe to another. If it truly indicated her capacity for opening her jaws, then the idea of her devouring small children wasn’t far-fetched. She could probably engulf rabbits and squirrels whole. Jane took a few slow steps forward and Peggy bristled with warning, but the mouth stayed shut.
“It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. Can you understand me?” Jane said.
Peggy tilted her head like a dog, eliciting a smile from Jane.
“We want to learn about you. We want to get to know you. People tell stories about you. We want to know what your story really is.”
Peggy tilted her head to the other side.
“Can you talk at all? Hey Jake are you getting this?”
“I’m getting everything.”
“Okay… Um, yes, we want to know what your story is. You see…Everyone has a story…”
Peg’s mouth flared wider than a hawk’s wingspan and she galloped toward Jane. Jacob reacted in the blink of an eye. The blunt ends of Peg’s ‘arms’ jabbed into Jane’s shoulders as she was tackled by the stinking, grinning predator. Jake struck her with a kick to the side of the head, enough to knock her onto her back. He helped Jane up and commanded her to run. He mentally went through the contents of the backpack he was wearing and cursed himself for not bringing any means of defense.
They had a good start but Peg was already galloping like some sort of bizarre deer and closing the distance between them. Her mouth gaped open like a demonic basking shark. She leapt and caught the heel of Jacob this time, just enough to make him stagger and fall. The oil lantern dashed against a nearby rock and erupted into flames. He rolled onto his back just in time for his abdomen to sustain the blunt force trauma of Peggy’s arms as she took another flying leap and impaled him in the stomach. No flesh was punctured, but the pounds per square inch was agony for his internal organs. He was just able to slide his knees up between his stomach and the monster and plant his feet firmly against her chest and send her flying onto her back. He anchored his hands to get up and found something round like a cylinder. Half a second of comprehension took him and a light bulb went off in his head.
He got up, stood behind the fireball that the oil lamp had become, and waited. Peg writhed herself back onto her stilts just in time to get a face full of fire. Jacob had taken the container of lamp oil that had rolled out of his backpack and thrown it through the fire at her. An improvised flamethrower. A painful squeal wrecked the ears of the two teens as Peggy was engulfed. There was no recovering from that one… it was a direct hit. The monster’s rage drove it to chase after the teens again and they fled, but they didn’t’ need to run far. The fire overwhelmed the monster, but they were too busy running for their lives to notice.
They ran until they couldn’t run anymore. They could see the street lights of civilization again. They looked back at where they had come from. Looked at each other. “The camera,” she said between gasps.
“We can go back and get it later. I’m sorry for having to attack her.”
Jane didn’t reply.
They agreed to go back early in the morning tomorrow, Sunday, and retrieve the camera. If she couldn’t get past her parents, he would do it by himself.

Part V
I fell into a burning ring of fire
Went down down down
And the flames grew higher
– Johnny Cash
Fire Marshall James Baldwin got a phone call at about one in the morning. There was a raging forest fire in a remote corner of the woods that surrounded Stocksville and it had progressed to apocalyptic proportions before anyone had called it in. After all, everyone was in for the night, not doing community fire watch.
Now the night sky was a hellish orange and eye-watering smoke was omnipresent. The local fire department was woefully inadequate, so firefighters from neighboring counties were called out in the dead of night.
The fire would be out of control for three long days. It claimed well over ninety percent of the forest, a good chunk of one of Stocksville’s upper-class neighborhoods, (revealing how shoddy those expensive homes really were due to how quickly they went up in flames) and rendered a church unfit for use for the foreseeable future. A black metal-loving satanist teen tried to take credit for that so he could say it was done with his magic, but it didn’t stick after Jacob came forward and accepted responsibility.
At the Stocksville Police Station, the room that they took Jacob into was small and quiet as a tomb. He could hear the tinnitus in his ears. He was alone with a female officer with dark red hair and chestnut eyes that were exotropic, causing her to stare around him rather than at him.
“You have a story for me, Mr. Pines?” the officer said without introduction.
He told her everything, except he edited out the presence of Jane at the incident of the fire.
She looked at him for a long moment before sliding a few photographs in front of him. They were black and white, so it took him a moment to realize what he was seeing. Once it hit him, you would have thought that his hair would turn white.
They were taken with PD equipment. Shots of a badly burned female body that had no arms or legs and a monstrously wide mouth that hung open.
“You found her,” Jacob croaked.
“This is the only reason you’re not being arrested right now,” she stated flatly.
Jacob breathed a sigh of relief. He would find out that it was premature.
The local media converged on Jacob. They were as interested in his account of the monster as they were about the price on his head from locals.
For weeks to come there would be reporters saying the same thing over and over with the scarred town in the background, Jacob’s face appearing
in a small square of the corner of the screen.
“A teenager from Stocksville is making history in more ways than one. He has accepted responsibility for starting what is considered the town’s worst disaster in decades. But it was all in self-defense from an attack that has led to the first truly solid evidence of stranger things that walk this earth…”
He was handling the cocktail of fame and notoriety rather well. Better than Jane would have. They kept in touch via email and he promised that he wouldn’t hog all the glory. She’d get involved when it was safe. It was the biggest bouquet of flowers he could ever offer her and that was the highlight of the whole thing.
Someone else was going to be famous. He just didn’t know it yet.
Harold Redshore. The mortician that would examine and prepare the monster’s remains for long-term storage.
He slid it out of the freezer and furrowed his brow under his pocked moon of a forehead. He would almost think it was fake if it weren’t for the wounds. It was so human and yet so devoid of typical human female features. It had to have been the last of its kind. It couldn’t procreate, as it had no visible reproductive system. Nor did it have a means of nursing young. Apparently a new species was born with it, and a new species died with it.
He picked up a scalpel just before Peggy lurched upwards and wrapped her mouth around Harold’s head, completely taking it in and clamping down hard. She twisted her neck and the muffled pop of Harold’s vertebrae sounded in her throat. Her limbs grew new wood out of their burned stubs. Her hair would grow back eventually. First things first. Her wide-eyed head bobbed around like a mutant chicken until she saw the stairwell. She ran up them and knocked the screen out of an open window and ran into the cool night."	9.13	15.0	Corban Groshek	10/09/2020
When Little Sally Falls Asleep	"There’s an orphanage situated in northern Pennsylvania, in a small town so isolated from the rest of the world that it might as well not exist. Why in God’s name anyone decided to put “Dawson’s Home for Special Children” here, I’ll never know. But, without any other opportunities in life, I’m stuck here until the day I draw my last breath.
Don’t get me wrong.  Now that I’ve been here for well over a decade, I’d never leave. If I can give even a single one of the children a better future in life, this pain will have been well worth it. But the kids they send up here aren’t exactly ordinary.
They’re the ones abandoned on our doorstep, left behind by their families without anyone to care for them. They usually move from orphanage to orphanage, acting in ways their caretakers just can’t understand. It’s not like they’re bad kids, but rather odd… It’s a fickle thing, to describe beings that don’t abide by the laws of science and physics.
To most, these kids might sound like mythical beings, or just deluded stories told by someone suffering from mental illness. Honestly, that was my first impression as well. But then they showed me Laura, the girl that never aged. She’d been ten for generations, but even her mind never matured; because her memory kept getting wiped on her birthday, leaving her in a perpetual cycle that never ended.
Even she wasn’t enough to convince me. Next, they showed me Alexander. He was a boy without a face, born flawless skin replacing each feature of his head. How he could breathe, of how he navigated the house without bumping into each and every wall was an amazing feat. It was as if he had eyes, a nose and a mouth, but he couldn’t talk. By the time I arrived, he’d already been there for three years, unable to effectively communicate with anyone.
Then there were less severe cases, like Daniel. He looked and acted like a normal child, but whenever he fell ill, every single person in the orphanage got infected with the exact same ailment, even if it wasn’t infectious. Or James, who just spoke a language no one had ever heard before, incapable of learning anything in English.
Not a single one of them were evil, and they sure as hell weren’t the monsters I’d been led to believe. They were just victims of various curses thrust upon them by an uncaring universe. I wanted so desperately to help them, to give them a chance at life, but for each year that passed, they kept dying; either from their own curse, or that of others. Those that fell to an early death were quickly replaced by new, abandoned children.
After my first year at Dawson’s Home, I wanted to leave with every fiber of my being. I’d tried too hard to help the children, but I just couldn’t. Even though I didn’t have enough money for a bus ticket, it had all gone to helping the kids. Still, I needed to get out, to find a new life before I turned suicidal.
But then I met little Sally…
She was the most wonderful girl, a perfect little child that just happened to wander onto our doorstep. I was the one to find her, standing outside the orphanage in dirty clothes after having wandered the streets for days. Without hesitation, I brought her inside; feeding her and giving her a fresh set of clothes. She was only six, but she was so extraordinarily thankful, polite and i intelligent well beyond her years.
As I put a bowl of hot stew in front of her, she just stared down at it, waiting for permission to start eating. My heart immediately broke once I noticed the hunger in her eyes, but she just sat idly by, waiting for me to tell her it was alright. Once I gave her the go-ahead, she basically inhaled the bowl, at which point I gave her a second serving.
I tried to figure out her name, but she couldn’t remember. All she knew was that her parents had called her “Little Sally,” but where they’d gone, she didn’t understand.
After she’d finished eating, she just started talking. She never mentioned what happened to her before we found her, but rather about her favorite animals, the climbing tree in her backyard, and the playground near her school. I did my best to decipher the clues, but at her young age, she didn’t give me much to go on.
It was starting to dawn on me that whoever she belonged to, they might not want her.
When I tried to ask about the parents again, she fell silent. She just refused to talk about them, but based on the bruises and malnourished form, we suspected abuse. Despite all that, she was the perfect child, and though we couldn’t quite figure out what had happened to her, we were happy to have her by our side.
On top of it all, I almost let myself believe she wasn’t cursed with strange abilities. At least until the first night she spent at Dawson’s.
We always give the newcomers a separate room for the first night, to adjust them to the new settings. Sally was no expectation, and we fully intended on integrating her into our large family once morning rolled around. She just needed time
As day gave way to night, I led her into her temporary room. The walls inside were filled with drawings from the previous children, each creating their own piece of art on their first day at our place. I explained to Sally that she’d be allowed to draw anything that came to her mind, a useful exercise both for us, to figure out how her mind worked, but also one to help her relax.
She seemed to like that idea, and with that, I left her alone for the night.
That night, I felt a modicum of happiness for the first time in months. I felt like I’d finally have the chance to help someone, to bring them into the real world, a task beyond just keeping them alive.
But despite my enthusiasm for our new family member, sleep would not grant me the rest I needed. My dreams quickly turned to nightmares, filled with worry and uncertain pictures of death. I knew the images I saw weren’t real, leaving me with a hint of lucidity, yet I could not wake until the alarm finally jolted me back to reality.
Exhausted, I went to check on Sally, to see how she’d fared during her first night. When I opened the door, I was greeted by a full new wall covered in paper. In the span of the single night, she’d produced just under a hundred new drawings, and they weren’t bad either. Most of them were scenic drawings of the woods, always taking place during the sunset.
“Sally, did you do all of this?” I asked in shock.
She nodded, and gave me a gentle smile. “Yeah, I can’t sleep.”
It was an odd answer, because she didn’t look tired. She was as fresh as she’d been the night before. I sat down next to her, as she went onto her next drawing of a princess riding a dragon over the treetops.
“You like trees, huh?” I asked, not sure what to say.
“M-hm,” she agreed enthusiastically.
Then I turned my questions back at her odd lack of rest.
“Was something wrong with the room? Was that why you couldn’t sleep?”
“No, I just can’t sleep very much.”
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t know. When I sleep, I have really bad dreams. They are even badder than the dreams you had.”
I was taken aback by her last statement. “My dreams?”
She put her coloring pencils down on the ground and looked up at me. Her eyes pierced me, and I could sense a hint of pity in them.
“You were scared, I saw it.”
“How did you know I had bad dreams?”
“I always see other people’s dreams, but only the bad ones. Then when I sleep, I have them too.”
“Nightmares?”
She nodded.
That’s the day we realized just how special Sally truly was. She was the girl that almost never slept, which meant it wasn’t a coincidence that she ended up on our doorstep. She was an outcast, abandoned like all the other children. Though her curse was minute in comparison to many others. Rather than help her deal with the curse, I wanted to teach her to embrace it, to be proud of who she was. That was a lesson I always tried to teach the others, to accept themselves, or at least the things they didn’t choose to be born with.
I gave the talk about her being special like the other children, which seemed to improve her mood. She was happy, as if she wasn’t alone for the first time in her whole life. She hugged me, and together we went to introduce her to the other kids.
* * * * * *
In the end, Sally didn’t need a bed to sleep on, as she could just stay awake. Still, we wanted to give her a place that belonged to her, among the other kids. They all embraced her with open arms, and went on to show her the different places in the building.
She quickly became one of us. Every now and then she’d come running to me when the other kids were having nightmares. They scared her, but she was always more concerned about them. She wanted me to help comfort them, to let them know they weren’t alone in their bad dreams.
It became a part of my daily routine, one I came to appreciate. Sally would let me know about other’s nightmares, and I’d come to the rescue. Things were going well, but as all things eventually must, the good times came to an end.
About one year after Sally came to us, I found her unconscious on the ground. It was the first time I’d seen her so still, as if all her energy had left her tiny body, and it terrified me beyond words. She didn’t seem wounded or anything, and she was definitely breathing, albeit a tad erratically. In a way, it looked as if she was dreaming, running away from something terrible.
I picked her up in my arms and carried her to the nursing station as we awaited a doctor. The orphanage was too far out in the countryside for an ambulance to reach us, which meant we didn’t have much in terms of help, apart from the single, local doctor.
Once I put her safely down in bed, she started wriggling around, and mumbled something about Daniel needing help. As she spoke those words, I heard multiple, horrified screams emerging from the playroom.
The staff rushed towards the scream, to find Daniel getting fused with the wall. His entire body had gotten entangled in the concrete surrounding him, and we could hear his bones crack under the immense weight. He screamed in agony, but trying to pull him out proved a futile task. All we could do was stare as he sank deeper into the wall.
“The sledgehammer!” I yelled as I held onto his arm.
One of the staff ran out of the room, heading towards the basement where the tools were kept. All the while, Daniel’s bones kept cracking, and his organs were turning to mush within the concrete. By the time they brought the sledgehammer back, his chest had been destroyed, making it impossible for him to breathe.
He died inside that wall, in agony, and never understanding why his life had to end.
It wasn’t until we dug his body out, until we saw the true extent of the damage. He had become a mangled bag of meat without the faintest hope of survival, and none of us understood what had just happened. We were just lucky the damage hadn’t affected us in the same way his diseases had.
As they cleaned up the blood and crushed chunks of flesh, I went to check on Sally, who had woken up again, and was crying.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to fall asleep. I killed Daniel,” she cried.
I tried to comfort her, but she wouldn’t have it. “It wasn’t your fault, Sally,” I said, though I didn’t fully believe it.
“I saw the wall smash him, I dreamed it.”
“You dreamed about Daniel?” I asked.
She nodded.
“What did you see?”
Then she went on to explain the dream in excruciating detail, each matching the manner of Daniel’s death. And that was it, the innocent girl I’d known for the past year was gone, and the true nature of her curse had been revealed. I gave her a hug and told her that it wasn’t her fault. Of course I meant it, because she couldn’t control her dreams. Still, it had been her.
We decided not to tell the other kids about what had happened, but even then they realized something about Sally had changed. Her previous happy persona had vanished, only to be replaced by something colder, more distant and broken.
The next year was spent mostly trying to figure out how Sally’s ability worked, a difficult task for someone who we’d only seen sleep a single time.
During that time, I also tried to pry deeper into her past. It took a while, but with the little details she shared, I could sort of create a picture of what had happened prior to her arrival at our home. She’d been sitting in the back seat of her parent’s car as she suddenly drifted off. Then she simply dreamed that her parents never existed, and with that, she woke up alone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.
“I don’t wanna fall asleep, but it happens anyway,” Sally would say.
It would take another year before she started hanging out with the other children. It was around the time of her eighth birthday, and she was playing hide and seek with Alexander. He was oddly good at the game, at least for a kid with no face, but on the sixth or so round, Sally never came to look for him.
Once it became apparent that Alex would never be found, he decided to go look for Sally himself, only to find her fast asleep in the corner he’d left her. As we figured out what had happened, we started escorting the children into the bomb shelter in the basement, figuring we should get everyone as far away from Sally as possible.
Then, as we shut the door, it simply vanished from existence, replaced by a concrete wall that wouldn’t yield. We were trapped with no way out in the dim basement. Then the lights went out as well, and we were plunged into darkness. There was a flashlight in one of the closets, but it hardly helped illuminate the room, it was simply too old and the batteries were close to death.
We were all standing around in horrified silence, and I was just praying that Sally would wake up before someone died. After a few minutes, the ground started feeling wet. I shined the light down at the ground, only to realize it had turned crimson red. The air reeked of metal, and I quickly figured out that we were all standing in a pool of blood that was rising rapidly.
The screams the kids let out were heartbreaking, but they were muffled by the thick concrete walls around us, meaning no one on the outside could hear us.
Within minutes, it swallowed us. We tried to swim, but moving around in such a thick liquid proved a complicated challenge. Once the blood hit the ceiling, we were all pulled under, unable to breathe. I held my breath for as long as I could, trying to find the children while under, but my eyes were blinded by the blood.
I must have lasted two minutes before my body gave in, and just as I inhaled a lungful of blood, the entire basement reverted back to its native state, meaning that Sally had finally awoken from her slumber. The blood vanished in the blink of an eye, and the door reappeared.
Once I’d regained my senses, I looked around at the kids and staff. Most were fine, coughing up chunks of partially coagulated blood, but James wasn’t breathing. I rushed to his side, still struggling to catch my breath. Then I started CPR.
The others cried as I pushed his chest in, desperately trying to fill my lungs with enough air for the young boy. I felt his ribs crack beneath my hands, but I had to keep going. Then, on the third set, he finally coughed up the blood, and started breathing on his own.
Sally was devastated, but despite the nightmare-inducing event, not a single person had died. That time though, we couldn’t keep Sally’s curse a secret; the children put two and two together, and Sally once again became an outcast, even among her own friends.
I decided then that the best way to help Sally would be to help her control her dreams. Working on inducing lucid dreaming, reality checks that could help her snap back to reality, and for a few years, it actually worked. Each time Sally would fall asleep, she’d realize what was going on, and wake herself up.
But on the rare occasion that it wouldn’t work, people had a tendency to get seriously wounded. On her tenth birthday, Sally dreamed that the building was on fire. Luckily, everyone got out in time, mostly suffering light burns and some smoke inhalation. Once she woke up, the building was fine, as if the fire never happened.
Then a few months later, Sally fell asleep twice in the same day. The first incident took place in the morning during breakfast. She’d created a new entity that she referred to as “Mr. Syn”. To us, he appeared as a normal, middle-aged man in a suit. He sat down with us in the dining hall and made casual conversation.
It wasn’t until someone asked about the briefcase, before the horrors began. It was filled to the brim with human skin. He said he needed it for his home, and tried convincing the children to come observe his room of flesh. Once he realized we weren’t letting that happen, he just got up and left.
Sally woke up from that dream relatively quickly, but she’d fall asleep again that very afternoon. That time, we just caught a glimpse of Mr. Syn walking down the hallway, blood dripping from his briefcase filled with skin.
But he’d come from the kitchen, where we found Mrs. Ingridson lying on the floor. The entirety of her skin was missing, stripped from the underlying flesh. She still writhed around in pain when we found her, but her body wouldn’t last long. Before we could even try to get help, she’d died from shock.
That was just the beginning of our living nightmare, because as Sally hit puberty, her slumber increased drastically in frequency. It went from being a once a year occurrence, to two, then three… Before she even hit fourteen, her dreams had become a bimonthly occurrence.  Ones that were wounding, or even killing, both the staff and children.
She knew it herself, that her dreams would inevitably end up killing everyone she loved, and we couldn’t deny that fact. But, running away wouldn’t stop the dreams; neither would locking her up. She tried using different drugs to keep herself awake, but her efforts were all fruitless. Nothing could keep her awake.
Eventually, I was hit with the only possible solution available. The only thing that could end Sally’s hail of nightmares… was death itself. It wasn’t like the thought hadn’t struck me before, but I’d forced it so deep into the darkest corner of my mind, that I’d never truly considered it.
To save everyone else, we had to kill Sally…
Since I was the closest to her, I was chosen to do the deed. Our doctor aided me in choosing the most humane way of ending her life. He gave me an injection I could only assume held morphine, but he promised it would be a painless death. With that, I would lull her into an eternal slumber.
I chose a Saturday to end her life. She’d asked me to take her out of town for the day, just the two of us, to her favorite hiking spot out in the countryside. It was a beautiful place, filled with endless fields only bordered by vast forests. I’d brought a picnic basket full of her favorite treats, a final meal to end her existence among us.
After we’d eaten, I told her what needed to be done. I didn’t want it to be a surprise, and I needed her to know that it wasn’t her fault. She didn’t even seem surprised. In fact, she almost seemed relieved that no one else would suffer as a result of her curse.
That’s why she’d asked me to take her out to the fields, because she wanted one final moment of happiness, to just pretend that everything would be fine. She’d considered ending her own life on numerous occasions, but couldn’t find the strength to do it.
We sat there for hours and just talked, made plans for a future she’d never have, and joked about the good memories that still lingered from her past.
“I’m sorry,” she mumbled.
“It wasn’t your fault Sally. Your dreams might leak into reality, but that wasn’t your choice. Life is not a balance scale between good and evil, it’s a chaotic mess filled with random events. You just got the short end of the stick, but that doesn’t make you any less of a person.”
“I just wish I knew why. What was the meaning of all this pain?”
“I don’t know.”
With these words, Sally fell asleep on my shoulder. I pulled out the syringe, ready to strike before her nightmares could end me. Tears were welling up in my eyes, and my hands trembled as I pointed it at her neck. But, despite her slumber, the world around me didn’t change. There were no horrors pouring out from her unconscious mind, nor any evil presence in the vicinity.
That’s when I realized that Sally hadn’t just fallen asleep. She’d actually stopped breathing. I let her down on the ground easily, and checked her pulse… She was dead. She’d taken her last breath before passing over to the other side, just like that.
Whether she dreamed about her own demise, or if it was a random stroke that finally ended her, I’ll never know. I gave her a funeral in the forest as she requested, dug her body deep underground so she could rest peacefully among the trees.
I failed Sally, like I’ve failed so many of the children at the orphanage before. But I keep trying, because if I just save a single person, it will have been worth it."	9.87	39.0	Richard Saxon	10/05/2020
Haunting Ain’t Easy	"Haunting ain’t easy. Not one bit. Them Hollywood studios make it look so easy, when in reality it’s a chore. You see, I’m a ghost myself. My name is Ernie Harris, and I’ve been a ghost for 115 years now. When I was alive, I was a laborer who, along with others, was hired to build a new courthouse in this town called Wilmington, Missouri located a little northwest of St. Charles on the mighty Mississippi River. You see, the city council back then felt that the 1850s courthouse was too small, outdated and inefficient, and they voted to build a newer, bigger one in 1904. In 1905, construction was almost complete on the three-story brick building when it happened. I was doing some bricklaying when the scaffolding I was on gave way, and I fell to my death. Upon my death, I found myself in the underworld.
Now, the underworld, believe it or not, looks like a giant city with cathedral-like buildings that stretch up into the green, misty sky and stand along cobblestone streets. In the middle of this seemingly endless city is the “Underworld Central” building, a tall, black stone building that comes to a point at the top. That is where ghosts like me go to work and get our haunting assignments from. One day, I was in the break lounge with my other ghost friends, The Major, The Bride, The Greaser and The Señora. Before I go on, let me tell you about my friends.
The Major, whose name is Reginald Redfield, was a Major in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars and was shot while leading a charge against the French Army during the Battle of Waterloo. The Bride, whose name is Pauline Feller, was on her way to her wedding in 1947 when she lost control of her car and went off a bridge into the Raritan River in New Jersey. The Greaser was a 17-year-old kid from Bakersfield, California named Tommy Marshal who was stabbed with a switchblade during a rumble in 1956. The Señora, whose name is Carlotta Gomez, was the wife of a wealthy Mexican landowner in the 1830s, who fell in love with one of her husband’s servants. When her husband found out about the affair, he forced the servant to leave and never come back, threatening to kill him if he ever returned. As a result, Carlotta took to her room, never leaving it, and she died of a broken heart.
So, we were sitting around the table, just talking. Tommy was going on about his latest haunting. “So I show up in my fright form, emerging from the floor of the abandoned school, and the guy craps his pants right in front of his girlfriend and buddies! No lie!  Just soils him right there in front of everybody.”
Now, us ghosts have two forms. There is our “live form”, which is how we looked when we were alive, and there is our “fright from” us ghosts use when we really want scare someone really good. We all laughed about Tommy’s big scare when the P.A. system crackled. “Will Ernie Harris please report to the Assistant Ghost Chief’s office for your next assignment.”
I got up and started down the hallway toward the Assistant Ghost Chief’s office. As I did, I passed another friend of mine, The Gambler, who was a Wild West gambler when he was alive. As I passed him, he asked with a smile, “Are you still on for Poker tonight? I heard ‘Boom Boom Betty’ will be there.” I said, “We’ll see. I don’t know what my new assignment is.” And with that, I made my way to the Assistant Ghost Chief’s office.
Now, the Assistant Ghost Chief’s job is to give ghosts their assignments that were handed down to him by “the Boys at the Top”. The Assistant Ghost Chief is a guy named Darrius. Darrius is one of the oldest ghosts in the underworld. In life, he was a high-ranking official in the Roman government over 2000 years ago, until he was linked to a conspiracy to assassinate the Emperor and was fed to the lions as punishment.
When I got to his desk, Darius greeted me and motioned for me to sit down. He then went over to a tray marked “New Assignments” and picked up a sheet of paper from the top. “Got another House in the Woods type haunting for you,” he said. “In the Catskills of New York State this time.”  I sighed in frustration. I had been doing those types of hauntings on and off for fifty years.
“Let me guess, upper-middle-class white family from the suburbs of some big city, and the dad is like, ‘this will be good for us.’” Darrius gave a wry smile and said, “You got it.” I just sat there shaking my head and said, “Look, I’ll do it, but I’m just going to bang on the doors, flicker the lights and yell boo, really loud.”
Darrius nodded and said, “I know how easy it for you ghosts get burned out, but look, it was faxed to me from the Boys at the Top, and they call the shots.  I’m just the middleman around here.”  He gave me a sympathetic look. “Look, if it will make you feel better, I’ll see if I can get the Boys to have you haunt The Queen Mary for a while,” he added.
I watched from the attic window as the moving van, followed by a silver Lincoln Navigator and a dark blue BMW sedan, pulled into the driveway. Being dead for 115 years, I’ve seen just about every make and model of car from the Model-T Ford to those fancy foreign jobs of today. The family looked just as I imagined. The father was in his late 30s, with his dark hair tucked under a New York Yankees hat, a light yellow polo shirt and tan pants. The mother was about the same age and was quite attractive, I must admit, with light brown hair, dressed in a black designer pullover and jeans. They had two kids, a boy about 10 years old with his mother’s hair color and with a red t-shirt with green khakis, and a girl of around 5 with her father’s dark hair, with a light blue shirt and white pants. As the parents talked with the movers, I saw the little girl look up at the attic window and I could tell that she saw me. She went and got her mom and pointed up at the window. But before her mom could look up, I went invisible. Good, I thought, start with the youngest ones, then gradually let your presence be known to the rest of the family before you bring out the big guns.
For the next few months, I did my thing. I banged on the doors loudly, I flicked the lights on and off, and I made all kinds of eerie noises like moans, groans and screams; standard ghost noises. Now, I noticed the family was scared, but the dad seemed so insistent that they stay. This I thought was a bit odd but not too surprising. In all my years of haunting, I’ve learned some people are just harder to scare than others.  But in the end, they all break at some point. You just have to press the right buttons. I also watched the family who had the last name Mackenzie, when I wasn’t trying to scare them. I watched as the kids, whose names I learned were Trevor and Katlin, went to school, did their homework, and played with their new friends. I watched as the husband, whose name I learned was Nathan, went to work while his wife Julianne stayed at home, went shopping, or went out with some friends. I also noticed how Nathan would often take Julianne on walks along a wooded trail that ran behind the house. At first, I thought nothing of it, and figured that it would be my coup de grâce. I’d show up in my fright form on one of their evening walks, and that would get them. I’d send them packing and moving back to the New York City suburb where they came from. But I wound up only getting one of them.
One night, while Julianne had taken the kids to her parents’ for the weekend, I happened to be by the master bedroom when I heard Nathan talking on his cell phone. The conversation went like this:
“Don’t worry, Britney, baby,” I heard him say. “I’ve got it all planned out. Next week I’ll take Julianne on another walk in the woods to a secluded spot where I secreted away a shovel, hacksaw and a bag of quicklime in a hollowed-out tree.  When we reach the spot, I’ll put a bullet in her head.  Then I’ll report her missing to the police and eventually have her declared legally dead, and then it’ll be just you and me, baby doll. What’s that? What about the kids? Don’t worry about them.  I’ll dump them on my parents in Yonkers, and tell them I just need some time to try and find myself again and get over the loss of their mom, and then it’ll be just you and me together in Puerto Rico.”
Now, when I heard all that, I got steaming mad. You see, when I was a boy, I was the oldest of five children and my mother and father were poor sharecroppers in rural Kentucky. When I around 9, my father left, telling us that he was going to look for work in the steel mills up in Pittsburgh, and that he would send for us once he had money coming and had found a place to live. We never saw or heard from him again. Eventually, my mother moved us kids out of rural Kentucky. We moved three times, first to Louisville, and then to Peoria, Illinois, before winding up in St. Louis. We eventually learned that my father had married some other woman in Pittsburgh. It broke my mother’s heart, and she wasn’t the same after we got the news, and she died a bitter, worn-out woman who had grown old before her time. As a result, I went ballistic when I learned what Nathan was going to do – and I decided to act.
I appeared in the room in my fright form. Nathan screamed in terror when he saw my fright form with rotted, yellowish-brown flesh, dead all-white eyes and crooked, rotting teeth. Nathan tried to run but I blocked his path. You see, us ghosts can become solid at will if we wish. I scared and tormented Nathan all weekend, never letting him leave the room. I only disappeared when Julianne arrived with the kids. By that time, Nathan had gone completely insane. His hair was white and he could barely talk as he had strained his vocal cords with all the screaming he did. After the men from the Hudson Valley Psychiatric Hospital took him away, I manipulated his cell phone so that Britney’s phone number was displayed.  I then got Julianne to dial the number by whispering the suggestion in her ear. I listened to the voice on the other end. The female voice said, “Is it done already? Did you kill her and hide the body?”
Julianne hung up the phone with tears in her eyes. I wanted to show myself in live form and comfort her, to tell her everything would be fine, but I knew if I just popped up it would scare her.  But she felt my presence and seemed to put things together, and whispered to me, “Thank you, whoever or whatever you are.”
Julianne filed for divorce and got full custody of the kids and remained in the house, Nathan was never charged with conspiracy to commit murder because of his incurable insanity and was left to spend the rest of his days in the psychiatric hospital. I had grown attached to the Mackenzie family and will occasionally peek in at Julianne, Trevor and Katlin from time to time, and even help them a little if needed, but will remain invisible.
Haunting ain’t easy, but it can help."	9.5	12.0	Andrew Scolari	09/19/2020
I Inherited My Father’s Snuffbox	"I’m used to mysteries in my life. I never met my mother, for example. My dad used to talk about her all the time, but she always felt like a pretend character, or like maybe she was just an imaginary best friend of his. Dad passed a few months ago, so I can’t ask him for any new details. He left me something in his will, though. It explained a lot that I hadn’t understood before. There are still mysteries, but the snuff box has revealed more than I ever expected to know.
The portable, steel container with the heavy lock on it was stored under Dad’s bed during my whole childhood. Whenever I asked him about it, he would answer that it was his snuff box. He would always grin wryly, as though making a joke I couldn’t understand. It was a weird kind of pun, I think. He never used tobacco, and so the only other meaning I could imagine was that it had something to do with killing. My father seemed like a gentle man, though, and so I chalked it up to English being his second language.
I was given a key to the snuff box as part of Dad’s final wishes. After he passed, I waited a few days to open the container. Years of foggy guesses had made me hesitant to learn more. I finally opened the box, though, and was relieved to find that it only contained documents and photographs. They were all seemingly normal keepsakes. On top was a picture of Dad with my Mom while she was still pregnant with me. It was the youngest and clearest photograph of her that I had ever seen. Dad looked happy, just like I remembered him to be in life. Under that picture though, were a dozen or so pictures of my Dad alone. I wasn’t in these other pictures, and neither was my mom. In every single photograph, my father’s eyes were hard and hollow. He looked positively haunted by something in every picture taken of him between the years of 1961 and 1969.
I was eight years old when my father took me out of East Germany. I was eleven by the time he brought me to America. It’s strange to think back and remember little snippets of certain days that the snuff box documents. I don’t remember my father killing anyone, but I do remember him leaving me in the car at a freight traffic checkpoint near the Berlin Wall. I remember sitting quietly while the engine ran idle for what felt like a long time. After that, I do recall my father hustling back into the driver’s seat looking grimier and less steady than he had been before getting out of the car. This is what I’ve been able to piece together about those years. These are the clues from my father’s snuff box.
* * * * * *
~1961~
I know from my father’s stories that I was born desperately premature, such that I was unlikely to survive. It was the summer of 1961, after all, and technology to sustain premature babies was crude and often completely unavailable in poorer parts of the world. Such was the situation in East Berlin. I knew all this already, but the snuff box provided a few new details that I hadn’t known. My mother had gone to stay with her family across town, in West Berlin, on August 10th. She was there to visit the relatively upscale medical and hardware stores, so that a better incubator might be built for the still-ailing infant me. In the snuff box were hand-drawn designs for the incubator. The handwriting was not my father’s; it could only have been my mother who knew enough about medical treatment to create and build the contraption.
On the morning of August 13th, my father called my mother and told her to hurry, because the border between East and West Berlin was being sealed by the Volksarmee soldiers. In the snuff box, there’s a blurry picture of three people dressed like soldiers in front of a tangle of concrete barricades and barbed wire. Partially obscured behind the early Berlin Wall fortifications is a woman I believe to be my mother. Another picture, dated three days later shows more fortifications, and the same woman waving to the photographer from behind the growing snarl of hindrances. Even despite two soldiers standing to block her way, she’s doing her best to be seen by my father on the other side.
Dad still thought he’d surely see his wife again soon, after the confusion was cleared up. His diary entries at the time express this naïve hope. There’s little in the snuff box from 1962, but the year after that included several important new documents that served as helpful pieces of the puzzle. In the far right corner of this second picture, standing on the East German side, is a man wearing neat and professional clothes who is glaring out of the corner of his eyes at my father while he takes the picture. I wouldn’t have noticed the man there, except that my father circled him with a red marker. In German, my dad has labeled the man with a question that was dated March 24th, 1965. Almost four years later, Dad apparently returned to this picture and asked himself:
Could this really be Karl Zaissen, already watching me?!”
~1963~
I found more than a dozen documents from various months of this year. All of them seemed related in some way to my father’s attempts to reunite our family. There were moments of fear and even despair in his journal entries from this time, as well. “Does she simply have a much better life in West Berlin?” This was what he asked himself on the 21st of April. It breaks my heart to know that my dad imagined my mom abandoning us like that. That wasn’t the truth at all, as it would turn out. The reality was much darker.
Dad’s first direct encounter with SSD Officer Karl Zaissen would be only a taste of the frightening and awful things that our family would suffer at the hands of the East German secret police. I vaguely remember this visit, only in so much as I remember a strange man knocking aggressively and then making himself quite at home in my father’s apartment. My dad was distressed for days after the visit, and it was only after reviewing the journal entries that I now understand why. By my own translation, my father wrote:
“Your wife has been classified as a western agent,” Officer Zaissen told me. “Her return to GDR would likely be a thinly veiled attempt at espionage. As such, she will be refused entry to East Berlin until the GDR has claimed the rest of Germany.”
”She’s no spy,” I told Zaissen. “She just wants to see her son, and her husband.” Zaissen scowled at my last remark.
“You should be careful not to make me suspicious. Loyalty to a West German spy makes you an untrustworthy comrade.” I begged him to consider that there might be some mistake. Throughout my pleading, Zaissen could only smirk and roll his eyes, and once even spat on my floor. As he was leaving, he added another comment I know to be untrue.
“You may also find it valuable to know this,” Zaissen told me just before slamming my door shut behind him. “There is strong evidence that your wife has taken to street prostitution as a way of fundraising for the FRG. I am told by our informants that she costs as few as 16 marks for an hour to use her.”
He is a sadistic man, intent only on causing me pain with his visit, though it is veiled by claims of state business. I will not believe his lies.
It is true that the Stasi was famous in its usage of Zersetzung tricks to break down citizens. They would tell only the most painful lies, and sow distrust wherever it was most damaging. What we call “gaslighting” in English was an art form in East Germany. I believe that Karl Zaissen observed my father to be strong, and simply desired that he be broken.
~1966~
1966 was an especially deadly year on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall. Because we were still under GDR control, we wouldn’t hear about it until much later. Twelve people died trying to cross the border without permission. Of those twelve, two were teenagers and three were children. Eleven of them died from gunshot wounds. The twelfth was a child from West Berlin of six years old. He drowned after a playmate sent him tumbling into the Soviet-controlled Spree River. Because of the border dispute, those present from both sides of Berlin hesitated to save the child until it was too late. Things were reaching a fever pitch in Germany, and yet even as the outright chaos was suppressed by the increasingly brutal state, things would still get so much worse in other ways.
I remember walking into the apartment with my father one day to find it ransacked. Even my room full of playthings had been thoroughly destroyed. I had been at school and my father at work. I helped my father clean up and check to see if anything was stolen. Nothing was missing, but everything was broken. It was clear, I remember my father saying, that the Stasi had done this to send a message to us. He must have been right, because later that night my father’s boss called him on the telephone to say that he had been terminated. Just before dawn, we were awoken by the sound of smashing glass and the clanging din of metal striking metal. Dad’s car was totaled by men who did not rush to flee as my father confronted them.
Instead, they approached, and one of the masked men extended his weapon – a heavy, steel pry bar – to prod my father directly in his chest. I remember watching from the window, fearing that I was about to see my father die. In our driveway, the men exchanged hushed words I could not hear, and then my father returned to the house looking as white as a ghost.
Father was despondent for weeks after this, but did his best to protect me from the fear that he was feeling. I remember his mood suddenly changing one day. He was previously depressed and meek, but suddenly he was focused and angry in a secretive way that I did not understand. Now, the snuff box has once again clarified things. In his journal, he wrote on October 2nd:
”A furtive man arrived at the door early this morning, and pressed an unmarked letter into my hand.”
The letter was in the snuff box too. It was from my mother, saying that she loved and missed us terribly, and desperately hoped to see her husband and her son before much longer.
“Some official on your side of the wall has apparently been turfing all my applications to come visit or relocate back to East Berlin,” she wrote. “I’ve learned that he is called Karl Zaissen. I’ve been advised that he may be holding some grudge against you or myself, or both of us, because officials on this side say they’ve never seen such prejudicial termination of minor claims before.
The last document labeled as being from this year is a page that Dad apparently tore out of his old school yearbook. An awkward-looking student with hard, glassy eyes was circled and captioned. The name beneath the photo read “Karl Zaissen.” The caption my father added in red marker reads as translated:
“She never wanted your affection, so now you spite our family. Disgusting worm.”
This was the final realization of East Germany’s inequities for my dad. He became someone who was willing to murder if that meant leaving this place.
~1967~
It was July 21st when my father received his wife’s death certificate. That was the first page filed in this year within the snuff box. The document said that Mom had passed away from illness in late February, almost five months earlier in the year. If there had been a funeral, then we had surely already missed it. Mom was gone, and it had been a deliberate act on the part of Karl Zaissen that were missed absolutely all of it.
There was so much water damage on the document that I could barely set about understanding it at first. At first, I thought perhaps the letter had been allowed to sit in the rain, but then I remembered our old East German apartment building had indoor mailboxes and tiny, useless windows which we rarely opened. No, I realized, it couldn’t have been rain. I believe my father must have wept over the paper repeatedly, tormenting himself with it for days, before he finally stored it away.
Father drank and cried, and I remember this part clearly without understanding why it should be stored so vividly in my young mind. I was witnessing a transformation in my father, and although I didn’t then understand it, I could sense the magnitude of what was happening. After the grief had poured out of him for weeks, his despondent sadness and newly focused hatred for Karl Zaissen became a new and unified mood which frightened me even then. His trauma transformed into daily periods of wild focus at his craftsman’s workbench. He was building something secret and terrible, which he would not let me see. When he was too exhausted to continue working on it, he would go into his bedroom and hide it somewhere even I didn’t know about it. Under the floorboards, perhaps? He had surely planned that even the Stasi, with their home invasions and careful surveillance, couldn’t ruin this – his final plan against them.
It was only upon reaching the bottom of the snuff box that I finally realized what he had made.
~1969~
The most fascinating documents in the snuffbox were the forged papers my dad used to cross the border. I remember how the guards had nearly waved us through, when suddenly there was some commotion that I noticed even as a child. Dad was told to leave me in the car and come with the soldiers for a “short chat.” Looking at the papers now, I can see that they were hastily forged. Spelling mistakes and blurred “official” seals were the best my father could do in imitating government permission to cross into West Berlin. These subtle hints of forgery aren’t the most interesting. What are most interesting are the spatters of dried blood on the papers. The bloodstained sections are circled in marker by my father, and arrows from each brown-red speckle draw the eye to a single note written in German:
“This blood used to belong to Karl Zaissen, but he doesn’t need it anymore.” After the note, a grinning smiley face is drawn. Dad’s diary entry on September 6th of this year explains in more detail about what happened on the day we escaped. I’ll translate an excerpt here as best I can:
The guards fell for my counterfeit documents, but Zaissen had been tracking me for years and today’s trip was no exception. He arrived just in time to halt our passage and demand that I be questioned more thoroughly. He insisted that he would interrogate me personally, and alone. I’m sure he intended to torture me before I was to be killed or else imprisoned forever. Luckily, I was prepared. I’d spent weeks fashioning my snuff tool, and I was already carrying it in my pocket.
I found the snuff tool that Dad was talking about, too. It was something like a captive bolt pistol that he had designed to be fired using a gunpowder cartridge that was loaded inside. Dad must have cleaned off the bits of flesh and dried blood from the heavy bolt, because there was little evidence that it had been used at all. Inside the propulsion mechanism was the sooty residue of burnt gunpowder. The device had certainly been used at least once.
Zaissen was in such a rush to begin beating me that he didn’t have me searched first. He even ordered the guards to return to their posts outside, likely so they wouldn’t hear me screaming while he tortured me. This was a stroke of extremely good luck, because it allowed me to return to the car without anyone witnessing what happened next. After the door was closed, I approached with purposeful meekness, as though begging for his understanding. When I was within arm’s length I stepped forward and put one hand tightly over his mouth and pressed the snuff tool against the side of his skull, near the temple. He knew what was happening, and so he struggled hard, driving a knee toward my groin and sending his forehead slamming away from the wall in an attempt to headbutt me. I resolved myself even further in killing him, but fumbled with the snuff tool as I drove it forward and triggered the bolt to fire.
I had done my best to impale his brain with my tool, but his squirming sent the bolt somewhere else instead. As I pushed him backwards to retrieve the snuff tool, I saw that the steel intrusion had not penetrated his skull, but instead pierced through the front of his throat near his voice box. The choking, strangled wheeze of air that Zaissen hissed out as tried to scream for help confirmed that I had silenced him but not dealt a lethal blow. Covering the new hole in his neck with one hand, he weakly tried to push past me toward the door. I followed, and allowed him to retrieve his keys and move a trembling hand toward the lock. It was then that I pushed him down hard into the corner of the interrogation room.
He fell forward onto his hands and knees. I put one of my boots between his shoulder blades and made him rest flat against the smooth cement floor. Kneeling over Zaissen, I pocketed the snuff tool and instead filled both of my hands with thick fistfuls of his hair. I pulled his head up with all the strength in my arms while my foot kept his shoulders planted firmly against the floor. I estimate that it took twenty seconds of this before a loud cracking came from Zaissen’s neck.  The pressurized hiss of air from the new hole in his trachea no longer wheezed out forcefully. When I untangled my fingers from the man’s hair, his head fell forward limply and struck the floor hard enough to unleash some of the blood that was inside. The thick, visceral blood from his broken spine started pooling to fill his mouth too, and out the new hole that my snuff tool had made. There were no more bright red droplets. Everything was congealing into the purple ooze of death, although I only stood over the dead man for what felt like less than two seconds.
I collected my documents and returned to the car as though a simple clerical concern had now been resolved. The guards waved us through. Looking down at myself after we were safe, I saw how much of Zaissen’s blood I had gotten on myself, and smeared on the documents by mistake. The guards must have seen the horrified look in my eyes, and simply assumed that the blood was my own.

From Germany, we made our way to Austria, where we lived until I was ten years old. My father obtained a worker’s visa to the US when I was eleven, and we’ve stayed here ever since. My father never remarried, and I miss him every day since he’s passed, but there is one thing that makes me very glad to know. In all the photographs that he and I have taken since moving to America, that haunted look in his eyes has never once made a reappearance. Losing my mother turned my father into something almost craven – someone willing to murder an enemy at a moment’s notice, if it meant not losing any more. After Zaissen died and he knew that I at least was safe, I think my father returned to who he always really was. He never wore that haunted look around me, never once during my childhood and not even on his deathbed. The bad memories had been stored away somewhere safe, banished to the snuff box so that they could not escape until he was done being my father. His work is done now, and I’m glad to understand what he did for me.
The picture of Dad standing next to my Mom from 1961 is now in a frame by my bedside. The sadder parts of his story are locked back up in the snuff box. I put the steel container under my bed, just like Dad used to do. I’ve set the bad memories aside to make room for joy, but I won’t ever forget that they’re there."	9.73	11.0	David Feuling	09/01/2020
Momma Won’t Stay Dead	"My sister didn’t come to the funeral. And I honestly didn’t blame her one bit.
There towards the end of Mom’s life, things had gotten unbearably rough. I took a semester off of college to stay home and help Dad out during Mom’s last few months, finding myself stuck in the hometown that I mostly tried to avoid visiting during the school year. It had felt too much like a ghost town and held too many secrets that I’d rather just leave dead and buried.
It was just this past summer that we had realized something was wrong with Mom. You see, she was a singer. She wouldn’t allow a single moment of silence in the house without filling it with some kind of song. Hell, some of my earliest memories is her standing at the kitchen sink, singing that damned musical song, “Mama Mia, here I go again, my my, how can I resist you?”
I had been home for summer break, doing my best to avoid going into town, doing my best to avoid seeing any of those old faces. It was morning, and Mom was in the kitchen, cooking pancakes while I waited at the kitchen table, reading a book. She had been singing that damned song again, but she had stopped.
“Mama Mia, here I go again, hi hi… Hi hi, no.”
It didn’t even register with me at first. I had been buried nose deep in some book that had been assigned for the next semester, trying my best to get ahead of the curve.
“Hi hi, there I go again. No, bye bye.”
I didn’t realize something was wrong until I smelled the pancakes burning. Just like the batter, the memory burns, getting up and seeing my mother standing there at the stove, face twisted in confusion, staring down at the pancakes.
“Hi hi, bye bye. Mama Mia.”
My Dad and I thought it had been a stroke. We rushed her to the hospital and after hours of waiting around and having several tests done, we were given the horrible news that Mom had early onset dementia.
The Mother I knew was slowly becoming lost in her own mind. Deteriorating.
It had been strange for me. Mom had always been the one to know how to take care of the cuts, bruises, the scraped knees of my childhood, but how could I help her with this?
During the early days, my sister had been there. It was the easy days. Mom still had a few clear moments. Moments where she would sing and get most of the words right. It was always hard during those days, because it would always give you that feeling that maybe she would be able to make it back. Make it back out of that haze.
Mom got to the point where she couldn’t sleep, or at least she couldn’t sleep at regular hours. So at night, we would take her to her bedroom and turn the television on for her. Dad had gone to what was probably the last Radio Shack in America and bought some radios; one for Mom, one for me and him, and one for my sister. Mom’s had the talk button taped down, so if anything did come up, we would hear it and come to help. My Dad and I slept in the living room with our radio, and my sister slept her in bedroom with the other.
Most nights, the only sounds coming through the bedroom radio would be Mom just muttering, sometimes singing lightly, “Mama Mia, hi hi.”
My sister left the night we were all woken up by Mom’s screams through the radios. We had turned on all the lights in the house and surrounded my Mom, with consoling words, telling her that it was going to be alright, that it was just a bad dream, that everything was going to be fine.
And my Mom grabbed hold of my sister’s arm and through a sobbing fit said “It’s taking everything from me.”
My sister yanked her arm from my mother’s grip. You could see a white outline on her forearm where my Mom’s hand had been. She had her things packed the very next morning.
I was furious. How could she leave just me and Dad? How could she leave Mom? I yelled and followed her all the way out to the car, where she opened the door and told me, “Her hand was so cold.”
Things got exponentially worse from there. Mom couldn’t do any simple tasks on her own, like eating or going to the bathroom. It hadn’t been much longer when she started forgetting who me and my Dad were, but you just had to get through days like that. You just had to. Had to for Mom.
There were moments where she still tried to sing, towards the end, but she kept saying that it was taking her words. Taking her words away from her. Taking her words, because it wanted them for itself.
I thought she was just talking about the dementia. But after she passed, I realized that it had been something else.
The house was quiet the day after the funeral. It was just me and Dad and the fifty pounds of food that family and neighbors had gifted us.
“The fuck are we gonna do with all this?” my Dad had said.
I didn’t know. I didn’t have the answers anymore. I was fresh out.
We mostly stayed in the living room because it was still just too painful to be anywhere else in the house. Mom had been a decorator, and her touch had been laid everywhere. So Dad and I stayed in the living room, eating cobbler and watching TV with the volume low and mostly in silence. We had the radio still sitting there on the end table.
I woke up sometime in the middle of the night with a bad cramp in my neck from having fallen asleep sitting upright on the couch. I was disoriented, not knowing when exactly I had fallen asleep and having only the light from the television to see where I was.
After some of my night vision started coming to me, I looked over and saw my Dad on the couch. He seemed to be sitting upright on the couch, and I couldn’t tell if his eyes were open or closed. I sat in the darkness, staring at his face, waiting for a moment that the television would flash some bright light so I could see if he had been awake, and once it did, I saw that his eyes were open.
I said at normal volume, “Dad?”
And his head turned quickly to me, and he raised an index finger to his lips. He didn’t make the sound, but I knew what he was wanting to make, Shhhh.
Confused, I looked back to the television, and saw that my Dad was lowering the volume. Once the volume was almost muted, I had heard what he must’ve heard.
Looking at the radio on the end table, you could see it light up, picking up some kind of noise from Mother’s bedroom. I couldn’t hear anything, but together, my Dad and sat there in the living room illuminated only by occasional flashes of light from the television, staring at the radio picking up some kind of feedback.
I thought that’s all it was, just some kind of static, nothing at all, and I was almost about to get up and turn it off, when I heard what my Dad must’ve heard.
“Mama Mia, bye bye, Mama Mia, bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.”
It was so light. I had almost thought that I was imagining it at first, but when I looked to my Dad, and saw that grave look on his face, I had known that he had heard it too.
He got up, and started making his way out of the living room, down the hallway to where Mom’s bedroom was. I couldn’t believe it. I just wanted to get up and leave. Go back to college, go back to my life before Mom had started getting sick.
I felt myself getting up off the couch too, feeling like I was still inside some kind of dream.
I followed my Dad out of the living room and into the hallway lined with photos of our family, all happy, all smiles, lovely eyes all around, lovely eyes watching me and my Dad inch slowly towards the closed bedroom door. You could hear it, there in the hallway, could hear the muttering, “Mama Mia, Mama Mia, bye bye.”
My Dad put a hand on the doorknob, twisted, and pushed open, with me right behind him.
And we saw her, dancing around in the moonlight. She had stripped off the dress she had been buried in and had tossed it in the corner of the bedroom. It was covered in dirt and grime. She had put on one of her nightgowns, and was twirling around the bedroom, lightly singing, “Mama Mia, bye bye.”
My Dad stepped into the bedroom and was just about to say “Hon”, and it all happened so quick from there.
It had stopped singing, stopped dancing, and it had turned on its heels in such an unnatural way, facing Dad and me, its eyes not pointing in the same direction as one or the other, and it was on my Dad, tackling him to the ground. His shoulder collided with my face, busting my lip and knocking me down to.
Dizzied, I got up on my elbows and saw what looked like my Mom on top of my Dad, her hands wrapped around his throat. He was clawing at her face, trying to get her off of him, I saw his thumb hook one of her nostrils and the other plunge into one of her eye sockets. I could hear him gurgling as the thing choked the life from him, and I could see him looking up at me from the ground.
I got up, and I punted the thing that looked my Mom right in her nose. I felt her nose cave in and heard the crunch. It felt like I had stubbed my toes on an end table, but she was off of him.
The thing that looked like my Mom landed sprawled on her back in the bedroom.
I limped over to my Dad, and got him up off of the ground. I wanted to just take him and get the hell out of the house, but he wanted to see what it was that had snatched my Mother’s skin.
We walked back into the bedroom and saw it, laying there. The skin bubble and the bones underneath crumbled, and it fizzled and popped. It made me sick to my stomach, but I couldn’t stop watching. It fizzled like spilled soda right into carpet, and it was gone.
My Dad and I packed small suitcases, grabbed a few platters of food from the kitchen, and we got a hotel room down the street. We didn’t sleep the rest of the night, instead we just laid in our twin beds, watching infomercials on the television. We didn’t say a word to each other until the sun came up, and even then, it was just to as for the television remote.
Dad showered, and I tried to stomach some of the leftovers, but couldn’t manage. I thought about calling my sister, but thought against it. What was she doing to do?
Somewhere around 2 p.m. today, I had fallen asleep. I woke up about an hour ago, to find my Dad sitting at one of the small tables in the hotel room. The hotel blinds were drawn, but I knew it was late at night.
He had brought the radio with him, and she was singing again.
“Mama Mia, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.”
He wants to go back. I don’t want to, but I can’t let him go back alone.
It’s been singing for the past hour. It is like it is taunting us."	9.96	26.0	Dimitri Villegas	08/29/2020
Listen to the Sounds of Your Extinction	"My hands trembled as I pressed the cold metal against my own temple. I was ready to go, but I needed another minute to deal with the finality of it all. I wanted death, and I’d made damn sure the gun wouldn’t jam on me. All I needed to do was to pull the trigger.
“You don’t want to do that,” I heard a voice say.
I jumped from my chair, and swung the gun around the room in panic. As always, the motel room was empty, save the ancient television and moist bed. There was no one there.
At first, I wondered if the sound had come from outside. Maybe they hadn’t been talking to me at all. Once the initial shock had worn off, I sat back down.
“Don’t do it, Garry,” the same voice said.
Still, the room was empty.
“Who – who’s there?” I stuttered.
I stood back up and scanned the room. I basically spun around in circles as I tried to comprehend where the voice had come from. Then, as I prepared to finally end my own existence, I saw someone standing in the corner.
He was a sickly pale, elderly man with a thin frame. He was dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, and didn’t seem the least bit fazed when I pointed my gun at him. In fact, he just smirked.
“Get the fuck out of my room,” I demanded with a trembling voice.
The man just gave me a peculiar look.
“You’re afraid of me?” he half asked, half stated.
The question froze me in place for a moment. There was a strange man in my room that had seemingly materialized out of thin air, and he had the audacity to ask if I was afraid.
“Why?” he continued.
“I don’t have any money or anything, but I’ll fucking shoot you unless you leave,” I said back.
“What are you afraid of? What were you planning to do before I arrived?”
“None of your business.”
“You were moments away from what you consider blissful death. What could I possibly do that frightens you?”
He was right. Though I’d planned to kill myself, I was scared. Not from death itself, yet, something about the man just sent shivers down my spine.
“Are you depressed? Is that why you want to leave the world behind?” he asked.
I shook my head.
“Yet, you so desperately want to die.”
The fear I’d felt as he arrived, had been replaced by morbid curiosity. Something about his utterly calm appearance, made it impossible to refuse his questions.
“I just– I don’t actually– I–”
“You feel like you don’t belong?”
These simple words sent a wave of sudden realization through my body. I’d thought about death a lot, but I could never pinpoint exactly why I wanted out. But, as he uttered that sentence, I finally realized what I wanted to escape from. My whole life, I’d never once felt like I belonged in this world. Despite having good friends, a decent job, my life just felt as if it was a crime. As weird as it might sound, I wasn’t supposed to be there. Though it seemed so obvious then, I’d never been able to define it so clearly.
That was it. That was exactly the reason.
“How did you – how did you know?”
“Because it’s a simple fact, Garry Widmore. You don’t belong here.”
“I don’t understand… How can you be so sure?”
“If you so desire, I can show you.”
I didn’t have to respond. The man, whoever he was, could read me like an open book. I put the gun down, and just stared at him. Then, with a simple touch, everything turned dark.
* * * * * *
As my mind awoke once more, we were in a void. I saw my own body from afar, walking through an endless world of darkness. Time passed, but whether it was a second, or a thousand years, I couldn’t tell.
“Where are we going?” I asked, but the man wouldn’t respond. I was too far away for my words to reach him.
Then, as I felt my mind fuse with the emptiness, the world came back into view. It was a town, or strange facility made solely out of gray, concrete blocks. An emaciated woman sat down beside the dead body of a man. He lay there in a pool of dirty blood, with a slit throat appearing to be the cause of death.
She cried over the loss of the man, but her eyes weren’t fixated on the corpse. Instead, she wouldn’t stop staring at a broken greenhouse, full of dried out plants and ruined vegetables.
That was the only sound we could hear. The woman crying, in a world devoid of any sound. It was if everything around her had been erased… no animals, no traffic, nothing.
Beyond the concrete jungle, there was nothing save barren landscape. The air was unnaturally dry, and the sun seemed to be hidden beyond a sheet of dark gray clouds.
“Hello?” I tried to call out to the woman, but not a single sound emerged from my throat.
“She can’t hear you,” the pale man said.
I walked over to her, and tried to put a hand on her shoulder. Though I could feel her, I couldn’t actually affect her in any way. She was like a solid object, and I had no power.
“Where are we?” I asked.
“Bunker #108, the last human embryonic-regeneration facility on Earth.”
Everything seemed so basic, yet modern in the most dystopian way. Despite it being impossible, I knew exactly what had happened.
“We’re in the future?” I asked.
The man nodded.
“And these people?”
“Are the last of humanity.”
He touched me again, and suddenly we were standing atop the tallest structure at the facility. The barren ground beneath stretched endlessly far in all directions around us. There was a depression of the ground far off in the distance, only containing small puddles of muddled water. It quickly dawned on me that it used to be the ocean, dried out and rid of all life.
“This is your future, where mankind is heading.”
It was too much to comprehend. Not only had humanity reached its end, but the planet had basically fallen apart with all aspects of life.
“What year is it?” was all I could think to ask.
He looked at me with an uncertain expression on his face.
“We don’t know. There are small details, variables that change with each iteration of time. But, the outcome is always the same. The planet dies, and no matter how hard humanity tries, it will succumb to the never-ending passage of time. Your people never managed to leave this planet. Instead, they draw their last breath here at this facility as they desperately try to maintain the last plant life on Earth. In the end, your species will be forgotten by the universe, with no impact on the fate of existence.”
I just stared at the dead landscape around us. The wind howled ominously through the concrete structures, and in the distance, we could still hear the woman cry. She was the last person on Earth, and soon she’d be dead.
“Humanity goes out with a faint whisper…” I thought to myself.
Dread filled my body, and I came to the harsh realization that we’re absolutely unimportant in the grand scheme of things. But, it didn’t make me sad, it only made me angry.
“Why are you showing me this?” I asked after a long moment of silence.
“Because, I wanted you to listen to the sounds of your own extinction.”
Again, the pale man touched me, and the world faded away beneath my feet. We wandered through the void for another eternity, before we suddenly found ourselves in the streets of New York. The sound of honking cars and people talking, greeted us like a long lost friend. In contrast to the emptiness we’d left behind in the future, it was pure bliss.
Thousands of people walked on the streets, each of them with a full-fledged life, their own purpose to fulfill in life. There was a strange static-like aura surrounding them, one they couldn’t notice themselves. Yet it was there, an energy I couldn’t understand.
As I admired their casual demeanor, I noticed pitch-black silhouettes walking among the crowd. No one seemed to notice, but the more I looked, the more I saw. There must have been thousands of them.
“What are these things?”
“The silhouettes are the people that could have been, people that don’t exist this time around. The rest are the chosen ones for the current iteration of time.”
They were potential people. They were humans that belonged to a different reality, or timeline, but how I could see them?
“Our job is to select the right people. For the past hundred million loops, we’ve tried to piece together a puzzle, all to prevent the future I showed you.”
“But, why?”
“Because humanity had a greater destiny than what you saw. Something changed everything, an entity placed here on Earth, with the sole purpose of destroying history.”
The words hardly came with any comfort, but I couldn’t understand why I’d been chosen. Of all the great people on Earth, why chose someone who didn’t even belong.
“Why me?” I finally asked.
He just stared at me, and answered the question with one of his own.
“Do you remember your parents?”
“I was raised in an orphanage. They said I was found on the street as an infant, abandoned and close to death.”
“No one knows where you came from?” he asked.
“I– I suppose not.”
As we talked, we made our way down the street. The man explained to me what the static-like aura was. He said it was energy that kept people linked to reality, that without it, everyone would look like the silhouettes; real, but not existing.
We walked down the street as I tried to recall my childhood. As we passed a department store with freshly polished windows, the man stopped me, and told me to look at myself in the reflection. Still, there was a massive difference between myself, and the others.
I didn’t have any aura surrounding me. Even the man that had accompanied me through the bizarre trip had the same static around him.
“Why don’t I have an aura?”
“Because unlike everyone else, you were never chosen to exist. In fact, until this very iteration, your presence on this planet remained unknown to us. You, Garry Widmore, are an anomaly that needs to be corrected.”
The implication had a sinister undertone. I wasn’t supposed to exist, how could they correct that fact?
“What exactly does that mean?”
“It means you have to be removed from time itself.”
“Removed? Why didn’t you just let me kill myself like I planned to?”
He sighed.
“It’s not quite that simple. Your life has had an impact on people, the good, the bad, and the seemingly unimportant. It all contributed to the world as it is. We have to make sure you never existed.”
His words made recall a quote by David Eagleman: “There are three deaths: the first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.”
While the first two deaths hadn’t bothered me all that much, the idea of being forgotten by everyone was a horrifying one.
“Everything I’ve ever done, it’ll be erased?”
“Only if you accept.”
“And it could change the course of history?”
He nodded.
“How does that even work? Are you just going to erase me, or split my body into atoms? I don’t really understand how that would work.”
“You’d become one of us, an agent. Everything you’ve done up until this point, will be forgotten and removed, but you’ll still have an impact on the world. Since you went undetected from us, we’re hoping you can do the same against whatever is trying to destroy history.”
“There won’t be any proof I ever existed?”
The man paused for a moment, as he mulled over what to respond.
“You can leave behind one thing. A story, an artifact, a letter. It’ll be yours, but no one will know where exactly it came from. Your name will be turned into a tale, but at least it won’t be completely forgotten.”
It was better than nothing, but it bothered me.
“Do you accept?” the man asked.
I nodded.
“Then it’s time to get to work.”"	9.82	11.0	Richard Saxon	08/28/2020
Skip to the End	"Let me just get the obvious out of the way first; yes, I’ve actually been to the future. No, don’t ask me about the Pandemic, or the Climate Crisis, or the next election, or next week’s lotto jackpot. I’ve been to the far future, long after any of that has ceased to matter. It was billions of years, at least. It was the very End of the Universe, I think. But, it wasn’t the end of everything.
I should probably back up a little bit, and explain how I got to the End of the Universe. I’m an Air Force officer, and I was selected to be the test subject of what my superiors referred to as a chrononautical Kitty Hawk. Out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, relatively close to the Hawaiian Islands, there’s a top-secret experimental particle collider. It’s underwater both for secrecy and so that they can use the ocean as a heat sink for the massive nuclear reactor that powers the thing. I wasn’t privy to all the details, so I don’t even know who’s funding it. There were definitely a lot of non-Americans there, so I’m pretty sure it’s an international collaboration.
From what I was able to understand, the experiments they’re doing there are meant to reveal the basic nature of time; whether it’s a fundamental aspect of the universe, an emergent property of more elementary components, or just an illusion of our own limited perception. The collider produced an unknown and, based on what some of the researchers told me, previously untheorized particle that caused bizarre temporal effects when they interacted with ordinary matter. For the time being, they were just calling them chronitons, since that’s what time travelling particles are called on Star Trek.
When they saturated an object with these chronitons, it would vanish for a period of time roughly proportional to its mass and then reappear in the exact same space. Sometimes the objects would be detectably hotter or colder, sometimes they’d be damaged, and on at least one occasion not even in one piece, but as far as the scientists could tell every atom they sent out came back, and never with any extraneous matter clinging along for the ride. The objects were clearly experiencing something during their missing time, but they couldn’t send a probe since the chronitons would scramble any electronics, no matter what they did to protect it.
It was decided they needed to send a human test subject to report back on what they encountered. I was chosen because I hit the exact sweet spot of having the necessary skills and temperament while also being sufficiently commonplace that should I never return my commanders would write it off as acceptable losses.
I was assured that the chroniton radiation was non-ionizing and that the tests they had run on biological samples showed no immediate or short-term ill effects. As for long term effects, well, we’d just have to wait and see, wouldn’t we? At this point, you may be asking yourself what I was getting paid to expose myself to unknown radiation and get blasted God knows how far into the future. The same Neil Armstrong got paid to go the Moon: bubkes. Absolutely nothing outside of my regular salary. I’m an Air Force officer, after all, and putting my life on the line for the good of my country is all part of the job. I should be honoured to have the privilege of being the first person sent into the future, they insisted. If the experiments were ever declassified, I’d be famous, immortalized even. And if I refused, I’d almost certainly be sent to a military prison for insubordination, so back to the future it was.
I stepped into the collider wearing a pressurized environmental hazard suit. This was necessary not only out of concern for travelling to an unknown environment, but also because the interior of the collider needed to be evacuated of air to function properly. The collider itself was a hundred-foot-wide tunnel that stretched on for miles, paneled with a shiny grey alloy that I had been told had to be invented just for the project. Every few hundred feet there was a glowing, humming ring of classified tech encircling the perimeter, all of them pulsing in perfect synchrony. There was no sound in the airless tunnel, of course, but I could feel their thrumming vibrations through my boots, and it was a sensation that I could only describe as humming.
The rings were all interconnected by four evenly spaced conduits that ran the entire length of the collider, each pulsing with an orbiting light which, in spite of the much greater distance, matched the RPM of the rings.
I took my place on the clearly marked platform and looked up the caged, flashing lights that counted down the initiation sequence, protected from the chronitons by a recess in the collider wall. The near-total silence was unnerving. All I could hear was my own breathing. I didn’t even have a radio in my suit since it would have just been scrapped by the chroniton wave. If there was any last-minute instructions, they would only be conveyed through the display in front of me.
As the countdown to full saturation ticked down, I started to see tiny golden lights forming in the space around me, whizzing around the collider at lightning speed. They were sparse at first, but after about a minute they became so thick I could barely see through the haze. They passed through me like I wasn’t even there, without producing any perceptible sensation as they did so.
I couldn’t see the countdown anymore, but when I felt my feet lift from the ground, I knew it was launch time. I slowly floated upwards for several seconds until I was in the dead middle of the collider, and hung there for several seconds more. I’m not going to lie, I was scared as hell, but I didn’t panic or try to fight it. What was happening was happening, and I was long past the point of being able to do a damn thing about it.
Without any sort of warning, I was catapulted forward at what felt like at least 5 Gs of force. The golden lights vanished, along with the collider, the facility, the ocean, and the Earth itself. I now passed through them as harmlessly as the chronitons had passed through me. I shot upwards, the Earth beneath me seeming to spin at an impossible speed as I did so. The Sun also receded, at a pace too quickly for the theory of relativity to allow. I understood that I was not moving at superluminal speeds, but rather that my arrow of time had been accelerated, and what I took to be seconds were actually years, then centuries, then millennia, then aeons. Faster and faster I went, passing through star systems in a fraction of an instant, so quickly that I orbited the entire galaxy once every few seconds like I was caught on some kind of out of control galactic treadmill.
Jane, stop this crazy thing.
After God knows how long of that, time finally began to slow again, and I began to descend upon a black planet orbiting a white star. Somehow, intuitively, I understood that this was Earth. The Sun had expanded to a red giant, charring the Earth black as it did so, then shrunk to a white dwarf, left to slowly cool for the rest of its days. Modern science predicts that the expanding Sun will actually consume the Earth. Whether this prediction is false or if our space-faring descendants succeeded in widening the Earth’s orbit, I don’t know.
From the high vantage point of space, I had deemed this dark Earth long barren of any life, but upon ground fall I saw that I had erred in my judgment.
I landed upon the Earth on my feet as a cat would from a tree branch. My journey through time and space had done me no harm, and I was left to survey the ultimate fate of my homeworld.
What I saw were still dunes of blackened regolith. Long, long ago, the warming sun had evaporated the oceans and ruined the atmosphere for photosynthetic life. The forces of entropy and erosion had beaten down all mountains and manmade structures, grinding them to dust. I could not help but be reminded of the poem Ozymandias, seeing everything lost to the global desert.
The molten core had cooled, and the magnetosphere weakened, leaving a more powerful solar wind to irradiate the surface and gradually strip the atmosphere away. The red sun, though an infernal fury in its death throes, had long since diminished to the white dwarf that hung in the darkened sky now. Though what was left of the atmosphere would surely no longer be breathable to me if I were to remove my helmet, the temperature was at least tolerable.
All reason told me that nothing could have survived such a cascade of apocalypses, and yet only a few hundred yards from where I stood there was a single tree. If I had to guess, I’d say it was nearly a thousand feet tall. Its bark was black, but not burnt. Its dark leaves were sparse, but present, and many moon-white blossoms bloomed upon its branches.
The tree cast a long shadow, like a sundial, and at its edge stood twelve evenly spaced humanoid statutes in a circle, alternatingly male and female. They were large, but not enormous, each being approximately twelve times my own height. Each had been hewn from a different color of translucent crystal, exposing a luminescent network of veins and arteries lying within. Each statue held at least two orbs of light within themselves, one in their heads and one in their chests, while a lone statue made in the image of a pregnant woman held a third and much brighter orb in her massive belly.
I staggered towards the figures in awe, thinking that they were some sort of memorial left long ago by the last humans, something that could unironically bear the words ‘Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’. All of humanity’s final collective genius put into crafting everlasting monuments to our existence that would stand until the end of time, a single last act of defiance against the uncaring and undying void. That even when the Earth had laid fallow for many times the length it ever bore life and all was reduced to ash, this one single testament not only to our existence but our exceptionality remained standing at the end of all things.
I stopped when I was in reach of one of the statues, gazing up at it in wonder and reverence. I noted that what I thought had merely been an aura of light around it was in fact composed of some vaporous substance that actively recoiled from my presence. In an act that seemed blasphemously daring to me, I tentatively stretched out my gloved hand and placed it upon the crystal surface. At the moment of contact, I felt a strange sensation flow through my body. It was neither pleasant nor painful, neither subtle or overwhelming, simply strange, and unlike any sensation I had felt before or since with nothing I can compare it to.
It was then that the statue turned its head to look down at me.
Dumbfounded, I looked at the other eleven figures and saw that each was now staring directly at me, when before they had all been looking up at the great tree.
I was hit with a sudden revelation then. This was not a monument left by the last Men; these were the last Men, the last Men standing vigil around the last Tree. They spoke to me then with some form of telepathy, not with words but with concepts, the language of thought that my mind processed in words and imagery and feelings. I perceived that they were the last of our post-human descendants, their bodies made of materials utterly alien to the natural universe, of which even our greatest intellects have yet to hypothesize about. Each of them alone possessed knowledge which dwarfed that of our entire civilization, cognitive capacities beyond our own not only in degree but in kind, and a god-like control over the forces of nature. In fairer days many thousands of such entities had once walked the Earth, alongside a diverse array of both traditionally human & radically posthuman races, and millions more dwelt amongst the stars. But over the vast stretches of cosmic time, even their race had dwindled. Some had perished in astronomically rare and powerful cataclysms, or in combat with other Titans. Most though had transcended to even great forms than the ones that stood before me, and left our reality behind as a hermit crab might discard a shell it had outgrown.
Now, just the twelve before me were all that remained of their kind.
They were not a random assembly of survivors, however, but each an archetypical embodiment of human character. Looking from one to another, I understood the nature of each: There was The Humble Commoner, The Innocent Maiden, The Mischievous Trickster, The Wise Sage, The Bold Adventurer, The Skilled Huntress, The Defiant Rebel, The Passionate Artist, The Brave Hero, The Carnal Lover, The Powerful King, and The Caring Mother.
Each held within themselves that which mattered most to them, what they deemed best of humanity, what they had sworn to safeguard until the Universe itself was no more.
And that time was now upon us.
I saw then in their minds the nature of the apocalypse before us; The Big Rip. The Dark Energy of the universe having grown ever greater, greater even then gravity, until millions of years ago The Milky Way and every other galaxy in Creation had come undone, the stars shooting off from their orbits and into the intergalactic void. Months ago, solar systems had suffered the same fate, planets breaking off from their parent stars, the Earth only remaining by the designs of the Titans before me.
Now, in the final moments, the Earth itself would fall apart, followed by exponentially smaller constituents of matter and then even spacetime itself in a Big Rip singularity. Even the Titans would succumb to this apocalypse, but even in the face of their demise, I sensed that they still held hope.
It was the Mother who was the source of this hope, for the glowing light gestating within her womb was not a Titan child, but a new Big Bang singularity. Its design was born from the minds of each of the Twelve Titans, its form forged from their own essences. If they were successful, this new singularity would survive the Big Rip and then explode into a new universe all its own, and they would be reborn as its gods.
It was then that the Earth beneath my feet began to shake, and I knew that it was time. The leaves and the flowers all fell from the tree, their wafting descent the final omen that life could not endure any longer, an omen the Mother defied as she went into labor. The Titans burst out into a hymn then, and in that moment their fate was the same as any other human, knowing they were to die with only faith that they would survive in some new form.
Just as I thought that I too might be destroyed in the Big Rip singularity, I started levitating again, and I knew that I was to return to my own time. Before I departed, however, the Trickster Titan plucked a single white blossom from the ground and placed it in my palm. Closing my fist around it, he winked, and I was off.
I flew upwards away from the Earth, and backwards from the Big Rip, repeating my trip around the galaxy in reverse until I returned to a blue and green Earth around a yellow Sun.
My return landing though was not nearly as smooth as my first. The instant my feet touched the platform, a shockwave cascaded through the collider, each ring violently exploding and showering the tunnel with shrapnel and strange plasma fires. The collider walls burst open and seawater came rushing in, sweeping me away and up towards the surface.
I let go of the flower during all of this, losing it to underwater eddies. I know the flower was the cause of the explosion. None of the other tests had ever brought anything back with them. The Trickster had used his power to give me an impossible gift, and the cost was the destruction of the entire facility.
I wasn’t the only survivor, fortunately, but the facility was destroyed beyond repair. When I was debriefed, I told them about the flower, about everything, but they didn’t believe me. They took the absence of the flower as proof that the whole thing was a fever dream, that nothing I had experienced was real. I felt a bit like Cassandra then, having been gifted with a divine revelation that no one would believe. But on the bright side, it means they didn’t fault me with the destruction of the facility.
I don’t know if they intend to rebuild the facility or not, but if they do, they’ll surely think long and hard before risking another human test subject. Billions of dollars for a weird drug trip is a bit pricey, after all.
After a battery of tests and a lengthy observation period, I was released and allowed to return to active duty, deemed to be none the worse for wear after my brief visit to the End of Time. I also, of course, had to sign a non-disclosure agreement swearing to never breathe a word about any of it to anyone. So, why am I telling you all of this now? Because the flower came back to me.
Last night, while I was on leave, I was taking a stroll by myself down the beach. My experience with the Titans still weighed heavily on my mind. I’m sure it always will. I was constantly reexamining everything I had witnessed, everything they had told me, forever uncertain if I was interpreting all of it correctly or if it had even really happened. I wondered if the Titans had been successful in creating a new universe, if they had been reborn to it, or if they had failed their greatest trial and were torn apart with everything else, leaving only true existential nothingness in their wake. I was walking just close enough to the ocean for the waves to caress my feet when, right in front of me, an incoming wave deposited a flower glowing like moonlight. In disbelief, I dropped to my knees and scooped it up in my hands, vigorously scrutinizing it lest I be deceived by wishful thinking and a mere coincidence. But there was no doubt in my mind that it was the same flower, the flower from the last Tree the Trickster Titan had given me. A radiant, silvery-white lotus bloom, stamens of metallic hydrogen and speckles of starlight upon its flawless petals.
It had returned to me. I know not why the Trickster gave it to me, but it appears it is not a gift that can be discarded so easily.
I had not given much thought to the Tree before then, to be honest. If anything, I had thought its survival a mere token act of conservationism by the Titans. But the gift of its flower and its impossible return indicated that it was more than this. Did the Tree serve some part of the Titans’ ultimate plans? Did taking the flower back to the present with me aid in their goals? Am I supposed to do something with it?
I can’t know for certain, of course, but I think the answer to all of those is ‘yes’. Beyond that, I have no idea. I wish that the Trickster had given me more than a wink in instructions. Maybe my mortal limitations are to be blamed for being so obtuse, but it seems if they were so smart, they could have found a way to make their intentions clear to me.
As much as I would like to believe I am the chosen one, meant to enact the will of the gods to ensure the salvation of all reality, there is one doubt that lingers in my mind; why was it the Trickster Titan who gave me the flower? If it had been their collective will that I take the flower back to my own time, then nearly any one of them other than the Trickster would have been a more suitable gift bearer, save maybe for the Rebel. Was it simply that he was nearest to me at the moment, or is it not more likely that he was playing a trick on me or his fellows by giving me the flower? Or is it merely that my mission requires some uncertainty, some doubt, some lack of any clear directive to succeed? Over and over again I’ve been asking myself why it was the Trickster who gave me the flower. The only answer that comes to me is a quote from the author Neil Gaiman.

Snow Angels are Illegal Where I Live	"My town is in one of the northwestern states, which, if you know anything about the northeast, means snow like… six months out of the year. To make things worse, my town is approximately in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. We deal with it about as well as every other tiny northwestern town, which…
Well, all you need to know is that there’s a town up here that is literally based around a prison. That’s it. That’s the whole point of the town. Pretty much just to house the people who work there.
It’s pretty dismal sometimes.
So you’d think, given the lack of other things to do, they’d embrace all the types of winter entertainment. And you wouldn’t be wrong! Snowmen are an art form in my town. Ice sculptures get pretty competitive. Tobogganing and sledding are Big. Deals.
But snow angels are illegal.
In fact, I didn’t even know they were a thing until I saw someone doing it in a film one time. I was over at a friend’s house, and they had an older cousin visiting from out of town. She’d brought the tape with her; it was one of her favorites. She thought we’d love it. She saw Harry and I staring at the TV in confusion and laughed at us.
“What, you’ve never seen a snow angel?” she asked us mockingly. I don’t think it was malicious. I think she was just teasing the way some people do. You know the whole ‘kids these days’ trope that every generation thinks they invented. We both shook our heads and she climbed to her feet, gesturing for us to follow her while she suited up to go outside. She got as far as falling on her back in the yard, us following her like ducklings, before my friend’s dad came running out of the garage yelling at the top of his lungs.
I’d never heard Harry’s dad yell like that before. Ever. And I’ve never heard him raise his voice since. Scared the bejesus out of all of us, including Harry’s cousin. He sent Harry and I inside, and I didn’t hear what he said to her, but she was as white as a sheet by the time he was done. They came back in afterwards and Harry’s dad called mine to come pick me up.
Harry’s cousin never came to visit again, but I never forgot. I knew there was something wrong with making a snow angel, I just never knew what.
Harry and I never discussed it. We went back to sledding and snow forts and never said a word. We both knew that something big had just happened, but neither of us was old enough, or mature enough, to really take any meaning from it.
Nearly a decade passed before we thought of it again.
Harry and I were both pretty average-looking kids. Neither of us had a whole lot going on to give us any kind of social edge, so dating in our very small high school, where the boys outnumbered the girls by something like seventy-five percent, was pretty much a crapshoot, and neither of us was interested in the male half of the population.
So when Harry formed a crush on Melissa, we both kind of knew it was doomed. I was his best friend, though! It was my job to be supportive, so I didn’t say anything. Like. At all. I didn’t know the first thing about being a wingman, but I did hesitantly suggest that Harry might get Melissa’s attention by doing something ‘cool’. Which, in teenage boy, translates to stupid and/or dangerous.
Unfortunately, Harry took that advice to heart.
God how I wish I could take those words back now.
It was late October and it was already snowing pretty regularly. Nothing bad yet, but more than just a light dusting. Halloween fell on a Wednesday that year, so the weekend before a few of us got together for a kind of preemptive party. We’d basically turned it into an excuse to party the whole week. We were out at Harry’s new house; his dad had recently built a really nice new place outside of town. It was kind of isolated, but it also had a hot tub, so.
And anyway, the isolation worked in our favor. Nobody was liable to file a noise complaint or a curfew violation on us way out here.
The irony is, Harry’s dad had actually given us permission to have a little get-together as long as we promised to be responsible. I guess it was because Harry was kind of going through a hard time, what with his mom having left and all.
It was a full moon that night. It wasn’t snowing, but it had that morning. There was still a pretty thick carpet of it all across the lawn. There were eight of us. Four boys, four girls. Harry and myself, Melissa, her best friend Joan, her little sister Nicole, and their boyfriends, Travis, Hunter and Chad. Melissa and Nicole were in the hot tub with Chad and Travis, while Joan and Hunter and Harry and I were playing pong on the deck.
Harry and I were losing. Pretty badly, actually. Travis was mocking us from the hot tub, his arm around Melissa.
“Nice shot, asshole,” he commented after one of Harry’s swings had gone wild. The ball tapped impatiently across the deck, careening off into the snow beyond. Harry made an impatient sound. I could tell Travis’ comments were starting to get under his skin. His jaw was clenched and I could visibly see him holding back his temper as he marched down the steps to collect the ball.
“Come on!” I hissed at Travis under my breath.  “Quit being a douche–”
Travis opened his mouth, most likely to say something nasty, but before he could get the words out I heard Harry call out, “Hey Melissa, want to see something cool?”
We all turned expectantly just in time to see Harry pitch backwards into the snow with his arms splayed out.
“Oh yeah, real cool, turd money.” Travis jeered, “You fell down! Way to go. I bet your mom is real proud.”
“What did you just say?” Harry stopped mid-snow angel. We all kind of fell silent for a second. Even Melissa looked shocked. She pushed Travis’ arm away and scooted to the other side of the tub, giving him a look of disgust.
“Too far, Travis.” She muttered. Maybe he knew it too. I’d like to think he was going to apologize, but Harry was already getting up and Melissa was leaning out of the tub – trying to change the subject, maybe – and asking Harry what he’d done, and then we all heard it. None of us seemed to know what it was at first. It was… hard to recognize. A short, sharp sound, as if someone had just been socked in the gut.
You know that sound you make when you’ve had the breath knocked out of you? It was like that.
“It’s a snow angel,” I said into the silence afterwards, trying to tell myself that it was just one of those weird sounds that came out of the woods sometimes.
“Oh.” Melissa furrowed her brow.
“Hey, I think I’ve heard of those.” Hunter put in, “One of the kids from Moore got arrested for making one in the town square after the game. His parents had to come pick him up.”
“Let’s Google it! Inside–” I was quick to suggest, but then the second sob interrupted me before I could get further than a few steps toward the house.
“What was that?” Joan asked. Harry finished climbing to his feet and stooped to pick up the ping pong ball.
I didn’t hear whatever Harry’s response was. I was too busy looking. Frozen in place. Riveted by the sight of the single, pale hand draped across the edge of the snow angel’s ‘wing’. This time we all heard the wail. And knew exactly what it was. The identical looks of confusion and fear that flickered across all of our faces gave it away.
“What the fuck?” Travis said.
“Oh my god!” Joan shrieked.
“Harry!” I yelped. I don’t have any conscious memory of crossing the deck. I blinked and suddenly I was there, leaning over the railing and grabbing him by the shirt. Hauling him away from the snow and toward the steps. Meanwhile, an ethereal vision was rising out of the snow angel as if it were rising on a pedestal. Blonde hair coated in frost. Pale skin mottled with blackened spots. Blue lips bowed back in a grimace of misery.
She was wearing a brittle gray robe. It crackled as she climbed from her knees to her feet.
“What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck!” Travis was wheezing a new mantra somewhere behind us.
“GET IN THE HOUSE!” someone else yelled. I held Harry’s arms, helping him climb over the railing. We raced into the house hand in hand, a frenzy of splashing and screaming going on around us. I sprinted as far as the couch. Before Harry dropped my hand and went back to lock the glass door. Nicole and Joan huddled against the far wall, sobbing softly. Melissa ran to the kitchen. Travis hovered near the window, staring in shock.
“The fuck is that?” He squealed. I wanted to cover my eyes, but I couldn’t help but look. I was drawn to that face. The look of terror and pain on it. I could still hear the sobbing through the glass as it tottered unsteadily to the steps and began to drag itself up onto the deck. It– she– moved so wrong. So stiffly!
“Oh, god,” Harry muttered beside me. I managed to glance at him, only to see him looking back at the snow. Not the thing, but the place it had come from.
There was another hand edging out of the snow angel. This one wrinkled and shriveled.
“We have to get out of here,” Melissa came out of the kitchen carrying a kitchen knife, “We have to get back to town and call the police.” Harry’s place was brand new. The landlines hadn’t been hooked up yet.
“Yeah,” I agreed.
“Just one problem.” Harry put in, lifting a hand and singling out the keys and phones sitting out beside the hot tub. Travis’s keys. Joan’s and Nicole’s, too. We all shared a look, because that only left two cars: My beaten-up Suburban, which barely had heat – not usually a huge problem, since I was typically dressed while inside it, but given that half the party was still soaked from the hot tub and wearing only their bathing suits… and Melissa’s coupe. Which would barely fit four people, even if they sat on each other’s laps.
“Fuck!” Hunter yelled.
“I don’t think we have a choice.” I ran my fingers through my hair. “Just grab some coats and blankets and let’s go. Hypothermia has to be better than whatever is going to happen when she–”
“They,” Harry interrupted quietly.
I didn’t bother to respond to that. I just dug my keys out of my jacket and headed to the door. I heard the others scrambling to grab what they could and following.
As soon as I was out the door I heard the howling. Not like wolves.  Like people. More than one, just… screaming. I sprinted down the driveway, half aware that I ought to have waited. I ought to have given the others more time to get ready, but some part of me just knew that every second we wasted was a step closer to death, and I wasn’t kidding when I said our chances were probably better for recovering from hypothermia.
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Melissa and Travis make it to her car, Nicole right behind them. Chad, Hunter, Harry and Joan were hot on my heels. I didn’t have to bother to unlock the doors. My suburban predated electronic locks, and the town was so small that normally I didn’t bother locking them all individually. We scrambled in so hard that it rocked. The old shocks squealed and squeaked in protest. I dove into the driver’s seat and slammed my key into the ignition, ignoring the seat belt and everything else while the others dragged themselves in and hauled the doors shut behind them.
I didn’t do a headcount before peeling out. That came back to me later. It was a miracle no one got left behind. If they had it would have been my fault.
I still feel guilty about that.
I saw them coming around the corner of the house in the rearview mirror. Not my friends, but the corpses. I was full-on panicking. Each heartbeat felt like a punch to the ribs. My breath felt like razor blades. I was so, so sure that I was going to puke as swung onto the highway, already doing eighty before we’d done a half-mile. Joan was still sobbing in the back seat.  Hunter was crying too. I think I would have joined them if I hadn’t been too busy shaking.
“Does anyone have a phone?” Chad asked. It was a great idea.  I glanced at him in the rearview mirror and saw him covered in the old blanket I kept in the truck bed. His hair was trying to frost. He had a cellphone in his palm.
I started to ask what was wrong with it when Joan chimed in, “Yeah, but no bars.”
“I’m going straight to the police station,” I said. Being that I was the one driving, nobody else had much say in it.
“What if they don’t believe us?” Joan whispered.
“They’re going to,” Harry said woodenly, staring straight ahead, “They made them illegal for a reason.”
“Why didn’t they tell us?!” Hunter demanded. Nobody answered. I guess nobody had an answer.
It was a tense, long period of silence, during which I checked the rearview mirror a dozen times. Not just checking for weird, frozen zombies, but for headlights.
Where was Melissa’s car? My old Suburban couldn’t have been that much faster.
My palms were sweating and prickling on the steering wheel. I tried not to think about it, or draw attention to it, the last fifteen minutes into town. Part of me was hoping to get pulled over by a cop, but as was typical, there was never one around when I wanted one to be.
I kept looking for them, even as we barreled into town and into the safety of the slushy gray parking lot of the sheriff’s department. I nearly drove right through the front doors. The whole car lurched from the force of that stop, but I hadn’t even slammed it into park before the others were scrambling out the doors and pouring into the station like a biblical flood of half-frozen, half-dressed teenagers.
Everyone was talking at once. I was the last in, keeping one eye on the window and the road while the others babbled at Olly, the receptionist. He was a nice old man in his fifties, at least, and I could tell he understood about zero of what was being said. Until Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the desk, anyway. Everyone else finally stopped talking.
“I made a snow angel,” he stated. Calmly. Factually. If it weren’t for how pale his face was and how tight his bloodless lips had become, I would have thought he was calm.
Olly’s face fell. His chair clattered as it rolled back, allowing him to stand up.
“I’ll go get the sheriff.” I knew then that it was every bit as serious as we thought it was. We hadn’t imagined any of it. It wasn’t some case of… mass hysteria or something.
“There’s something else,” I added, pausing to look at the window, hoping to see Melissa’s car pulling in at the last second. It never did.
“I haven’t seen Melissa, Travis or Nicole since we left the house.”
Olly’s expression turned graver, if that was possible. The Sheriff was Melissa and Nicole’s father.
He turned and hustled to the back faster than I’ve ever actually seen him move before. There was a tense moment. A hushed exchange of words and rising voices, and then Sheriff Basket came striding down the hallway, bigger than life. He was a massive wall of a man, and all of us had always been a little intimidated by him. He’d never been mean, exactly. He was just stern. Quiet. Had a direct, down to earth way of dealing with things and usually that involved as few words as possible.
“How many were there?” Case in point.
I didn’t understand what he was asking, at first, but Harry got it straight away.
“Two, but I think a third was climbing out when we left.”
I watched Olly getting some emergency blankets and jumpsuits out of the back for the others. For Chad, anyway. Hunter, Joan, Harry and I were all more or less dressed. Olly passed me a blanket anyway. I mumbled a thank you.
“What did the first one look like?” the sheriff demanded.
“It was a woman!” Joan shouted. Her voice sounded reedy and thin. I thought maybe she was on the verge of hyperventilating.
“She had on this dress… thing,” Chad added, more subdued, “and she was blonde, I think. It’s hard to remember.”
“She was pretty,” Hunter whispered, sinking into his blanket and the wall at the same time, “She looked so sad.”
The sheriff looked visibly relieved, but his face was still tight with stress and concern. He looked gray, actually. His skin, his hair, even his eyes. I didn’t blame him. I was only a teenager myself at the time, but already I could sympathize.  I understood the terror he must have felt, knowing his kids were out there. In danger. Not knowing if he’d arrive in time, or what might have befallen them.
“It could be worse,” he muttered to himself.  I don’t think we were meant to hear.
“You kids stay here. Olly, call their parents. You lot were at the Olsen place, right?” He pinned us with a severe look. I nodded. I’m pretty sure the others did too. I heard one or two meek ‘yes sir’s.  “Your parents can explain when they get here.” Those last few words were so clipped and bitten off that I could hear his teeth click on some of the syllables.
I, for one, wasn’t about to argue. I wanted to see my mom and dad more than anything in the world in that moment. I was still young enough that for me they represented the epitome of safety. Nothing bad could happen to me when my parents were there, in my adolescent mind. They were still invulnerable giants. The axis upon which the world turned.
I watched in silence as he checked his revolver and then went to the munitions room and came back with a shotgun and a box of shells. He walked out into the night without even a nod in our direction. His eyes were already on the road. He looked to me like a man going to war. As if he weren’t sure he was going to come back, and was prepared to accept that.
Resigned, but also determined.
“Come on, kids.” Olly spread his arms and herded us all toward the back of the station, “Let’s get you warmed up. If any of you have a working phone, now’s the time to go ahead and call your parents.  It’ll be better coming from your number than the police station’s. Those of you who don’t – sorry,” he joked and pointed an ominous finger at the payphone on the wall and the stack of quarters beside it.
He was a nice old man – had kind of a beardless Santa vibe – but it was hard to ignore the tightness in his voice. And around his eyes.
Poor Olly. He had to be pushing sixty. He’d been working in the sheriff’s department since I was a kid. Sometimes he came to help provide ‘security’ at events in town. He’d never been anything but cheerful and friendly. Seeing him so pale made me feel…
Helpless.
What we’d seen at Harry’s house still hadn’t completely sunk in yet. A part of me thought that I was going to wake up any second, and that it would all turn out to have been a bad dream. All around me the others were calling their parents. I heard phones ringing. A couple had already picked up. Voices were cracking. Muffled sobs and sniffles filled the open office space.
I looked aimlessly between desks for a little while, my brain not quite having caught up to the idea I should be doing what they were all doing. Eventually my gaze drifted to Harry, only to find him looking back. It struck me then that he didn’t have anybody TO call. His mom was… well, he couldn’t call her, and his dad was probably still on the plane.
Which meant he didn’t have anybody but me.
“I guess we should call mom and dad.” I tried to smile, fumbling my cell out of my pocket, “They’ll be pissed if they’re the last ones to know.” Internally I cringed. Why had I said that? Especially after literally just thinking he couldn’t call HIS dad?
Harry only nodded.
My mom picked up on the second ring. I called her first because I figured she’d be the least likely to yank my ass through the phone to chew me a new one. I needn’t have bothered, it turned out.
“We’re on our way,” she said before I could even say hello, “Stay put.” And then she hung up.  But before she did, I heard keys jingling in the background and the car starting up. Cellphones were notoriously unreliable in my town. A text could be sent and hang in limbo for a week before arriving at its destination. Calls often just failed to connect.
I glanced down at the phone in my hand and up at Harry, running my fingers over the glossy screen.
“They’re on their way,” I reported. Harry just nodded again.
My house was only twenty minutes away from the station on a bad day. My parents made it in seven. I guess that’s where I got my lead foot from.
Joan and Chad’s parents made it first, but only by a few minutes. Both sets swarmed their respective offspring. There was a lot of scolding and fussing and anxious questions. I couldn’t help but think they looked like preschoolers. Small and lost and wide-eyed despite their ages. Maybe it was because I was feeling like one myself. Just a small kid on a big playground.
Woefully out of my league.
And then my parents came rushing through the door. Mom’s coat was barely on, unfastened and hanging off of her, as she stormed in. Dad’s boots were untied. They looked like they’d dropped everything and run to come get me, and I was so grateful for it. It was the most loved feeling I think a person could have. Dad rushed to me, but mom paused mid-step and diverted to Harry.
I wasn’t jealous. I was weak-kneed with gratitude. Trust my parents – the adults – to know how to make right the things I didn’t have the tools to fix myself. I learned a lot about empathy and maturity that day, watching my mom fuss over Harry as if he was her own. He’d been my best friend since childhood. He’d practically grown up in our house, and I in his. My parents were the closest thing he had to his own in that moment. Maybe better, knowing his parents like I did.
She checked him over like the other parents were checking their kids. Hands and face, arms and neck.
“Thank god you’re okay,” Dad said, catching me up and squeezing me like I was nine again. I squeezed him right back, fighting tears.
“They didn’t touch you? You’re alright?” Mom was asking Harry. All he could do was nod, I assume. His eyes were suspiciously bright.
“It’s okay,” Mom said, giving him the same kind of hug dad was giving me just then, “It’s going to be okay.”
“Melissa and Nicole were in the other car,” Chad half-yelled. I know he was talking to his own parents, but all of them stopped and looked at one another, sharing the look of horror and tense gratitude. How awful, but thank god mine are alright.
“Olly said you’d explain when you got here.” I wiped my eyes on the back of my sleeve and looked up at my father’s face. His blue eyes were haunted and unhappy, but he nodded once.
“Yeah. I guess it’s time. Normally we tell the graduating class after the ceremony…”
Mom looked up. They met eyes for a little while. I imagine they were searching for the words, for a good place to begin.
“Why didn’t anyone explain before?” Joan demanded, “Why didn’t anybody warn us?”
“Let’s just– let’s start with the most immediate problem.” My dad suggested when no one else spoke up, “Tackle one thing at a time. First of all, what did the first thing through look like?” I don’t know if it occurred to the others, but it struck me that this was the second time we’d been asked – and both times it had been the first question, after asking if we were okay.
“She was blonde, and pale. And wearing a weird dress. She looked like she was in pain,” I supplied, anchored by the presence of my parents.
It seemed to me that every adult in the room heaved a little sigh of relief.
“That’s good. I mean, it’s not great, but it’s better than it could be.” Mom muttered, wandering over to the pile of blankets on the desk and absently gathering one. I watched her bring it over to Harry to drape around his shoulders, fussing with the way it hung until there were no wrinkles to smooth out anymore.
“We’ll start with that, then.” Dad took a deep breath, “We call her the Angel. That’s what our grandparents called her. I assume that’s what THEIR grandparents called her. Of all the harbingers, she’s the least violent. She’ll lead the people behind her to the nearest, most easily accessible source of heat. Once they’re all thawed they’ll… go away again.” As dad explained, I absent-mindedly rubbed my chest.  It hurt, like I’d pulled a muscle.
Harry looked up, expression going from numb and distracted to suddenly upset.
“Melissa’s car. Adam’s heat doesn’t work.  I– they must have–”
Dad looked grim, but nodded.
“It’s possible. Especially if the doors to the house were locked. The good news is they won’t have hurt the others unless they tried to stop them. The bad news is, if the car stops running or the heat quits, they’ll go back to trying to get into the house.”
Everyone took a minute to digest that.
“So… all they want is to get warm?” I asked hesitantly.
“Yeah.” Dad nodded, “But only if the harbinger is the Angel.”
“O-kay,” Chad looked up at his parents, “but what are they?”
“As far as we can tell,” Chad’s mom was the school nurse, a petite blonde lady with a ‘can I speak to your manager’ haircut, but as sweet as could be, answered this time.  “They were people. People who used to live here at some point. People who… died. In the cold.”
“Then there can’t be that many, right?” Joan suggested hopefully. It was a hope I didn’t realize I shared until that moment. Surely one or two frozen zombies were a lot better than a horde, though.
“Dozens, at least forty.” My own mother put in. She gave Harry a little squeeze and looked at me apologetically.
“I’m sorry honey. There’s other’s… but they don’t all come at the same time, usually. It all depends on the harbinger, like we said. Usually, it’s no more than eight or nine at a time, but sometimes, when the shepherd comes through–”
“The who? The what?!” Travis cried, his voice warbling a high, awkward note that I thought he’d left behind in middle school.
“Harbingers are…” Dad rubbed his fingers together, obviously searching for the words.  “They’re like the leaders. Only one comes through at a time. They’re the first out through the gate when it’s open, when a snow angel is made. Some of them, like the Angel, are mostly harmless. Mostly. There are four that we know of. Four that we were told about. Her, the Shepherd, the Prophet, and the Hermit.”
He walked away from me while he spoke, folding his hands behind his back and pacing over to the desk and from there to the window.
“The Angel comes with eight or nine others, who are mostly peaceful. They’ll smash doors and windows if they have to, but so long as they’re left alone and you don’t attempt to harm them they’re harmless. They’ll find the nearest source of heat and stay there until they’re all… warm… again.”
I didn’t want to think about that too hard. I hoped it was more… supernatural than it sounded, because the way he put it made me think of a bunch of warming corpses in a room, and that made my stomach churn.
“The Shepherd is one of the worst. They – he, we think – comes through with all of the followers. And he’s not content with just them, either. He hunts down anyone he can find when he comes through and will drag them out into the cold to die and join his herd. He sends the others, too. If he ever gets through the only thing to do is start the siren and get to the bunkers around town, and then pray that the barricades last until dawn.”
I started to shake just thinking about it. Imagining it was… it made me feel cold from the inside out. I shared a look with Harry, knowing he felt the same way. How close we’d all come to THAT. What he had to be feeling knowing that he’d almost let that through.
“Then there’s the Prophet. She won’t outright hurt you, but if she finds you she’ll… it’s hard to explain. She puts people to sleep, in a way. Mesmerizes them with a song.  And when you’re under, apparently you have visions. Of the past. Of things that happened in this town.” Compared to the Shepherd, that sounded like a cakewalk.
“But you’re there until she’s done with you. Which could be hours. And wherever she catches you, which might be out in the cold, or in the shower, or–” He left the rest up to the imagination. “Her followers put out lights. They pull down electric lines and will smash lamps.”
Okay. That sounded less ideal, but still a whole lot better than the zombie-murder Woodstock.
“The Hermit is the worst, though.” My dad looked at Hunter’s parents and then Joan’s, and finally sighed like he didn’t want to be the one to say the words.
“They come alone, and unlike the others, they won’t vanish at daylight. They keep hunting, keep killing, following the people of the town no matter where they run until a sacrifice is made. Our parents thought that might have been where the new harbingers come from. Sacrifices to make the Hermit go away.”
“That’s horrible!” Joan gasped. I cringed too. It was awful to think about. Deliberately selecting someone you knew, someone who you lived with, to go die. And then making that happen! Killing them in the worst way I could imagine.
How did you even begin?
“But it’s just the Angel this time,” Hunter said, his voice shaking.
“Yeah,” My dad nodded, “She should be gone by morning.”
So that was it, then. We just had to make it to morning, and then everything would be okay. Right?
It wasn’t, though. In fact, I can confidently say that was the beginning of the end, the slow roll into the destruction of the town, and the majority of the people who lived there.
For a time it was quiet. A few of us managed to fall asleep, either in the padded benches of the holding cells or in the chairs lined up against the walls. I was still wide awake, watching the windows with Harry and clutching a cup of hot cocoa for warmth. The hands of the clock barely seemed to move, and then–
With a pop and a crackle, the dispatch radio came to life.
It was the sheriff. I didn’t understand the codes he was using, but I got the gist of it pretty good from everything that was said between.
Multiple 123s, more units required. Send medical and the blasters.
After that, it was a flurry of voices and sirens. Orders were being shouted. Sirens blared. Olly sat behind his desk and closed his eyes. His lips moved silently, tracing the words of some prayer. I reached for Harry’s hand, but the look in his eye… he was practically on the moon. So far away I couldn’t reach him.
We both knew that it was going to be bad.
We didn’t know how bad until one of the other officers started talking.
“We’ve got two injured juveniles in route to the hospital. Clear the roads, provide escort where possible.”
Only two?
“We’ve got eyes on them. Eight. Angel is missing, repeat, the Angel is missing. One victim unaccounted for. All units respond.” It went on like that for a while. The noise woke up everyone who’d managed to fall asleep. One by one we gathered at the window, watching for the flashing lights as they sped like shooting stars down the main road toward our tiny, provincial hospital.
Wondering who was inside. And if they’d make it.
Eventually, the noise from the radios died down to chatter back and forth between officers sweeping the woods. I gathered bits and pieces, but no more. Something about a set of bare footprints heading into the woods. Something else about a second, fresher set of tracks behind. Both vanished near the pond. The search went on, but nothing else important was said.
Eventually, the first blush of dawn touched the sky. We watched it rise, Harry and I, side by side, as the first of the officers returned to the station, muddy and disheartened. The adults gathered in a huddle with them. I wasn’t meant to overhear, but my ears had always been sharp. Like the radio, now in person, I caught snatches that were just enough to paint a picture.
‘Travis and Nicole.’
‘Broken arm. Severe frostbite. Should recover.’
‘Melissa. Missing. Old lake. Angel.’
They told the rest of us a barely edited version of events a few hours later. Travis and Nicole had been found outside Harry’s place. Travis had a broken arm. Both he and Nicole had pretty bad frostbite and were suffering from hypothermia, but were expected to mostly recover.
Melissa was still missing. They thought the Angel’s flock had mobbed the car while Nicole was still getting in. Melissa had gotten it started, but hadn’t driven away immediately because her sister wasn’t fully inside yet. Travis had taken the passenger seat, and Nicole couldn’t get in past him, as he was too big.
Well, the delay was enough for the heater to get started. The dead had converged on the heat, and when Travis tried to fight back they’d tossed him aside like an old newspaper.
Melissa must have run. She didn’t know what we’d just been told. She probably thought they were being attacked. I mean, that’s what I would have thought– did think. But in the end, I guess it doesn’t really matter why she ran into the woods. They never did find her. We all went home, one by one. Harry’s dad came home on the next plane, but, understandably, Harry didn’t want to stay in that house anymore.
They moved away a couple of months later. Not long after Nicole and Travis finally got out of the hospital. Travis ended up losing the arm; the frostbite combined with the break made it impossible to save. They tried, but in the end, there was nothing to be done. Nicole recovered physically alright. She lost a few toes and a finger, but the real damage was psychological. Losing her older sister like that… the way it all went down.
She was never the same.
The rest of us got together after graduation. The same ‘party’ where the town’s secrets would originally have been explained to us. It turned out there were a few things we still hadn’t been told.
“I just don’t understand why anyone lives here at all,” Joan was saying to Mr. Harkman, the man that had formerly been our math teacher for pretty much our entire lives. The town wasn’t big enough that we really needed more than one or two. There were rarely more than thirty kids per grade. I was standing by myself under a pennant banner, watching the flecks of light from the disco ball swim around the floor.
She was going off to college next spring. So was I. I think we all were, except Nicole and Travis – and Hunter, I think. He’d decided to stay behind. Or maybe he couldn’t afford college. I don’t know, I never thought to ask.
“Most people do leave.” Mr. Harkman sighed. “I think we all tried to escape at one point or another.”
“Escape?” Chad, who’d been over in the corner beside Hunter and a couple of other kids from our grade, lifted his head to ask. By then the story of that night had spread to every kid in our tiny high school, regardless of grade. I can’t help but think that was a good thing.
“Well, why’d they come back, then?” Joan demanded heatedly at the same moment. Her face was flushed, her eyes glittering.
“Your parents didn’t tell you?” Mr. Harkman looked surprised, and then just sad, “I’m sorry. I guess I can see why. The thing is, you can leave the town just fine – until you have kids. And then… the town pulls you back. Things happen. You lose your job, you have an accident, your plane or bus gets rerouted. You black out and wake up back here, in town, with your kid. It’s inevitable. If you try to leave, you end up here again.”
A hush fell over the room. I don’t know if they were thinking the same thing I was, but my very first thought was: I’m never having kids.
Poor Harry. If only anyone had told him."	9.94	16.0	Craig Groshek	08/22/2020
Never Look Out a Window at Night	"I was always told not to look out a window at night, because you might not like what’s looking back at you. They call this an “old wives’ tale” or something like that, but for me, it was just a bunch of silly crap, so I made a point to do the exact opposite.
Like most people my age, I guess I felt like I was spitting in the face of some outdated, half-assed logic, that some old person had come up with.
I mean who the hell goes around looking into peoples’ widows, am I right, and since I didn’t believe in ghosts, monsters, demons, or whatever, I didn’t give that notion a thought either.
I know, some of you will say there are creepy people that have been known to do this, but I’ve always lived in a very nice neighborhood, so the likely hood of this happening was pretty slim, or so I thought.
One night, I got out of bed to make a late-night deposit in the porcelain bank. I finished my business and washed up, then decided I was kind of parched, so I went to the kitchen for a drink.
I grabbed a glass, opened the fridge, and filled it with tasty, cucumber-lime water I keep in there, because who wants to drink boring tap water.
I finished drinking, and as I was about to leave the kitchen, I glanced at the window. “Might as well take a peek,” I said to myself as I walked over to it.
I looked out, and as usual, nothing there. I turned to walk back to my bedroom when I decided to take one more look.
The most horrible face I’d ever seen stared back at me.
The face, which was pale white, smiled at me, but not with a regular smile. Its smile was inhumanly wide and filled with sharp teeth.
I screamed, ran back to my room, jumped in bed, and covered my head with the blankets.
“What the hell was that?” I whispered to myself. I tried to put it out of my mind and go back to sleep, but it took a while.
The next morning, my parents asked me why I had screamed the previous night. I gave them a lame excuse about seeing my reflection in the window and that it had scared me. They seemed content with my explanation, so there was no further discussion. Besides, I was convinced that I had imagined the whole thing in the first place. It had been the middle of the night, I was extremely tired, and my eyes were probably playing tricks on me.
That night I found myself up late working on coursework for one of my college classes. It had been hours since dinner and I was starting to feel a little hungry. I knew there were a container of hummus and some artisan crackers with my name on them in the kitchen, so off I went.
With my snack in hand, I started back to my room. As I passed the window, I stopped and glanced at it.
I really didn’t want to look out it, but I refused to bow to superstition. It was 2020 and I was a college student for crying out loud. My brain just wasn’t built like that.
I walked over to the window and looked out. Nothing. “See there,” I told myself smugly, “superstition is wrong again.”
I walked a few steps down the hall, then turned around and went back to the window and looked back out it.
The face was there, smiling its evil smile. I dropped the hummus and crackers as I backed away from the window. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t make a sound.
The thing on the other side of the window raised a pale hand and wagged a long finger at me like a mother chastising her child.
I fled to my room, and as I entered, I saw the blinds on my two windows were open. The thing’s face stared at me from both of them, and I ran back into the hall.
I went into the bathroom and slammed the door behind me. I slumped down on the toilet with my head in my hands and begged for the thing to please go away.
I heard a tap above me, and when I looked up at the small bathroom window, the face was there too. It still smiled while it shook its head.
It wasn’t going to stop apparently.
Hopelessly, I stood up, stepped into the shower, and pulled the curtain closed. I stayed there for the remainder of the night, but I didn’t sleep.
The next morning, my parents found me in the bathroom. I tried hysterically to tell them what had happened, but they only looked at me like I was crazy, and after I tried to cover all of the windows in the house, they brought me to the hospital.
I’ve been hospitalized for a month now, and it’s really not that bad. The doctors made sure I got a room without any windows, which has really helped my mental state, and things have been going so well, that a few days ago I got my cellphone back.
With all this time on my hands, I’ve been thinking about the circumstances that led me to this point, and I’ve decided that maybe I was wrong about old wives’ tales and superstitions. In fact, I urge anyone reading this not to blow off the old ways. They exist for a reason.
That being said, there’s another saying I’ve heard that I can’t help but be concerned about, especially considering I have a mirror in my room.
It’s the one about the eyes being the windows to the soul."	9.71	14.0	Chris Fox	08/13/2020
I Dreamed of Digging	"I remember each dream quite vividly. They were the kind you have where everything seems so real that when you wake up, you struggle to differentiate between the waking world and the dream world.
The first night, I woke up and the sun had already risen. I slid out of bed, making sure not to wake my sleeping wife Abigail, slipped into my shoes without bothering to tie the laces, and went outside. It was no longer winter. Summer had come, and the trees were alive with green leaves. The air smelled fresh and warm.
Still without the sense that this was a dream, I walked around the house to the back yard. The peonies Abigail had planted along the fence were in bloom. I admired them for a moment, trying to figure out why I had come outside to begin with.
“Looking for something?”
I looked up to see Travis Pollard, my neighbor, watching from his yard with a smile. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts, and my brain finally accepted that it truly must be the beginning of summer.
“I don’t know,” I told him.
His smile quickly faded. “Your wife.” He said grimly.
“My wife?”
He lifted a shovel over the fence and dropped it at my feet. “Better get digging.”
Confused, I picked up the shovel. “Why?”
Travis nodded, indicating the yard behind me. “Winter will be here soon.”
I looked at the soft, green grass. “But… it’s already winter.” Nevertheless, I picked up the shovel and felt its handle, solid and firm in my hands. Looking back to the fence, Travis had disappeared. I was still standing there, holding the shovel, trying to make sense of his words when I woke gently from the dream.
To my relief, Abigail lay beside me in bed. I could hear her soft breathing, but to ease my worries I gently touched her, feeling her pulse. She was warm, so I snuggled up against her and drifted back to a dreamless sleep until my alarm woke me.
I had actually forgotten about the dream from the previous evening when I awoke to find the sun up again, warm and inviting. As before, I crept out of bed, pulled on my shoes, and went outside.
Travis was on his side of the fence, busying himself, when I returned to the back yard. I walked over to him in a haze, slowly recollecting what had happened the last time. He looked up as I approached and smiled at me.
“Looking for something?” He asked.
I stared at him as the words found their way onto my tongue. “My… wife?”
He nodded, his smile vanishing again. He tossed the shovel over the fence, narrowly missing striking me with the handle.
“Better get digging.”
“Winter will be here soon,” I said.
Robotically, I picked up the shovel and walked to the middle of the yard. I felt the earth yield as I dug in, pounding the tool into the ground with my foot and working free a clump of dirt. Within minutes, I had dug a fairly small hole. I looked over to the fence, but once again Travis was gone.
I awoke to the real world peacefully, confused as to how I had gotten back into bed. My hands still felt like they had the shovel in them. As before, I rolled over and touched my wife, felt her presence, confirmed her heartbeat, then fell back asleep pressed against her until my alarm went off.
As you can imagine, this dream made me really worried. Was it a premonition? Was something wrong with my wife?
That morning, I asked her if she had a doctor’s appointment coming up.
“No, why?” she replied.
I was afraid she’d think I was silly for suggesting she schedule one, so I said nothing.
Outside, most of the snow was melted, but the ground was still crunchy and hard. Melted drifts had refrozen into slick piles of ice. I walked around the yard, inspecting it, but nothing seemed out of the norm. I was spooking myself, that’s all. The cream was just a dream. That’s all any dream is.
The following nights, the hole I had dug the night before remained, growing ever wider as I went through the paces of repeating my performance. Travis would toss me his shovel, I would pick it up and go to the middle of the yard where the hole was, and dig it deeper and wider. Deep enough and wide enough to lie down in. Deep enough and wide enough to bury someone in. I could see the pattern, and it frightened me. Somewhere in that hole was Abigail. I had gotten up, left her in bed, but now she was waiting for me to find her at the bottom of the hole.
Days went by. Weeks. The hole got so big that I had to climb down into it. I’d always climb out and inspect it before the world seemed to fade into blackness and I’d wake up to find myself beside Abigail in my bed, checking my hands and fingernails for signs of dirt. Every night, I’d check on her, hug her to me, frightened for what the dreams meant.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. As we sat eating breakfast, I opened up, confessing to her my fears. I told her of the dream, of the hole, and of Travis’s words.
“I have an idea,” she said. “Tonight, when we go to bed, I’ll hold your hand. You’ll feel me holding your hand when you go to sleep, and you’ll know I’m still here in bed when you get up.”
“We can try it.”
So we did. That night, I lay next to her and she held my hand tightly. I was a little afraid that she’d fall asleep first, or that one of us would roll over, but I distinctly remember suddenly waking up and her hand was still in mine.
The sun was shining through the bedroom window, reflecting off the shay dresser mirror. Abigail lay beside me, her skin glowing, and as I looked she opened her eyes and smiled at me. I breathed a sigh of relief. It truly was summer. Winter was long ago, and the nightmares I’d been having months ago had fled as quickly as they had come.
We rose from bed. Abigail put on her robe, and I slipped into my shoes. Together, we walked outside to enjoy the beautiful new morning. There in the back yard was the hole. Of course, it was there… I had been digging it for weeks. It was deep and dark, and still not finished. I still had to keep digging, to find…
I turned and looked. Abigail looked back at me. “I’m still here,” she said.
Travis appeared by the fence. “Looking for something?” he asked.
“I don’t know.” I kept my eyes on Abigail. She smiled back and winked.
“What’s with the pit?” Travis nodded toward the hole.
I looked down into the darkness. A glimmer of something shining struck my eye. I squinted, trying to discern what it was, but it was too dark.
Abigail appeared beside me. “What’s down there?” she inquired.
“I’ll find out,” I said, and rolled up my sleeves.
“Wait,” Abigail grabbed my arm. I looked at her, she looked at me, and I saw the concern in her eyes. “We stick together, remember? We both go down.”
I nodded.
Carefully, I helped her descend into the hole, holding her hands and making sure she didn’t slip. Once she was in, I climbed down beside her. Kneeling in the dirt, I felt around, trying to find the glimmer I had seen from above. But it was gone. Abigail crouched beside me, digging at the dirt with her hands.
“Do you see it?” she asked.
“Not anymore.”
From above us, Travis called out. “Need some help?”
Abigail looked at me. “We could use a light.”
I nodded. Getting out of the hole was a chore. With a jump, I managed to grab the upper edge and after some struggle, hoisted myself out.
Travis peeked over the fence, watching me brush myself off. In his hands was an electric lantern, which he passed to me as I approached.
“Thanks for your help, Travis,” I told him.
“You forgot something,” he said. His face darkened.
I froze. “Abigail.”
He shook his head. “No. The alarm.”
The buzzing of my clock startled me awake, jolting me out of bed. It was the first time in almost a month that I had woken to it first, rather than on my own. I could feel my heart racing in my rib cage, and I pressed the heel of my hand into my chest to try to calm myself.
After a moment, I switched off the clock and rolled over to check on my wife. She was gone. Her place in the bed was empty, though there was still the silhouette of her form pressed into the mattress. Had she gotten up before me? I arose and checked the bathroom, then went downstairs and looked for her in the living room and kitchen.
The house was empty. Abigail was gone. My head was swirling with confusion and panic. She was with me when I fell asleep! Where had I seen her last? What month was it?
I looked out the window at the cold, bitter morning. The horizon was still only pink from the rising sun. The air was cold enough that cars passing by left a trail of exhaust.
Pulling on my coat and shoes, I trudged outside and hurried around the back of the house. The back yard was empty. No hole in the hard, frozen ground. Kneeling down, I felt the ground with my hand. The grass still covered everything, no spot where a hole had been dug.
I was still there, panicking and confused, when my neighbor Travis came out to get his newspaper. He saw me crouching in the backyard, eyes full of fear, and came over.
“Looking for something?” he asked.
I stared at him, trembling. “Can I borrow your shovel?”"	9.14	14.0	William Dalphin	08/10/2020
The Secret Covenant	"An illusion it will be, so large, so vast, it will escape their perception.
Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.
We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute. We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks.
We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.
The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information.
The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons.
They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them it’s for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things.
When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison.
We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say.
If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives.
We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.
Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.
We will foment animosity between them through our factions.
When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best.
We will make them rip each other’s hearts apart and kill their own children. We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers.
They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.
We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger through images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labor. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.
We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.
When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.
We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us. The recruits will be called “initiates” and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth.
They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us. For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars. They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know.
The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until it’s too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.
When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.
But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. This they must never know. If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action. They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.
This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans. This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.
This covenant must never, ever be known to exist.
It must never, ever be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the prime creator upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself."	9.42	12.0	Anonymous	08/09/2020
Parents Know Best	"My upbringing was about as traditional as an upbringing gets. My parents were married, I had a younger sister, we lived in a nice suburban neighborhood, I had friends at school, all the trappings of a normal, healthy childhood.
But there was one thing.
One rule.
One rule that was reiterated daily to my sister and I since the day we were able to understand what it meant.
One rule that I swore by.
Don’t look out the windows after dark.
Our house was, as I said, in a suburban neighborhood. It sat at the side of a cul-de-sac, the entirety of which was bordered by a small woodland area that separated it from the next neighborhood. It was a perfectly safe area; there wasn’t anything immediately apparent that we might see if we looked out the windows at night.
I abided by the rule, as did my sister; we didn’t know any better. We figured if our mom and dad insisted upon it, there must be a good reason for them doing so. I didn’t know that it wasn’t a rule all families recognized.
Until third grade.
We’d had a substitute teacher one day just before winter, and that substitute teacher had elected to play a movie, and that movie was The Right Stuff. This movie had so entranced a classmate of mine, Ben, that when he came to school the next day, he brought with him the assembly manual to the telescope he’d convinced his father to buy him the night before.
Ben was ecstatic, bragging to all the other kids who had enjoyed the movie about how it was set up in his room, and how he was going to “look at the flag on the moon” and other feats when it got dark out that night. I questioned rather matter-of-factly just how he planned on doing that, considering he couldn’t look out his windows, and unsurprisingly, I was met with odd looks and a few awkward, confused laughs from kids who had no idea what I was talking about.
Our parents had never told us exactly why we weren’t supposed to look out the windows after dark, at the very least they hadn’t told us any real reason beyond just enough to get us to stop asking questions. Their favorite seemed to be “If you love your family, you won’t look out the windows after dark.”
For a time, our windows had been boarded up, but neighbors had complained and the city had threatened a fine if they weren’t taken down, so every night when the sun was setting, my parents would go around and use duct tape to make sure our blinds stayed shut. Not wanting to be forever known as the weird neighbors, they would remove them and open the blinds every morning.
When I got home from school the day that Ben had bragged about his telescope, I posed the question to my parents again.
“Why can’t we look out our windows after dark?”
I got the same answer I always did, and something inside me, some odd mixture of curiosity and embarrassment at what had happened at school, and doubt, made their answer unacceptable for the first time. For the first time, I didn’t just blindly believe what they’d been telling me my whole life.
That night, sometime after my mom had kissed me on my forehead and told me goodnight, and my dad had put duct tape along the bottom of the pull-down window shade, I sat up in bed. I felt like I was doing something wrong, but I didn’t know why. As such, I peeked my head into the hallway, making sure there was no glow from the TV emanating from my parent’s room.
When all felt secure, I went to the window in my room, a single window that faced the backyard. I took some deep breaths, mentally preparing myself to see some unholy hellscape that somehow arrived at dusk and packed up and left by dawn. I went to the side of the window, where I could just barely pull the shade back, and with one final deep breath and blurred images of unimaginable horrors racing through my mind, I shut one eye and looked through.
I saw trees. I saw my backyard, and past it, I saw the trees that made up the thicket of woods that surrounded all the homes of the cul-de-sac. In the sky, there were a few stars, which up to that point I’d only ever seen in videos or if I happened to be outside after dark (for whatever reason, being outside after dark wasn’t forbidden; the rule was strictly limited to looking out the window, though my parents did their damnedest to make sure we were in before the sun set every night). I saw the moon.
I sat back for a moment, thinking. There was nothing there, just the same things that were there during the day, only now at night. I was both disappointed and relieved, but more than anything I was confused.
I looked back through the space between the shade and the window frame again, and that’s when I saw it.
Something dropped from a branch of one of the trees and hit on the ground below it, landing parallel to the ground. I squinted my one open eye to see what it was, but once it hit the ground, it didn’t move anymore. I stared at that spot for what seemed like a long time, and just as I looked away, at that very same moment, whatever it was sat up. When I looked back, I saw the silhouette of whatever it was just sitting straight up.
Then it stood.
Its legs wobbled like a baby deer is it started walking towards our house. Maybe it was the fact that I was a child, but I remember it looked tall, upwards of 7 feet. I watched the silhouette saunter towards our house, and I distinctly remember my heart beating harder with every step it took. I watched its thin, spindly arms sway, and I remember its head looking all around from side to side, up and down, like it was observing the world for the first time.
I wanted to look away, but I was terrified.
The closer it got, the more sure-footed it became. Before long, it got close enough to trigger one of the motion sensors my dad kept back there, and the whole backyard was flooded with light.
It wore no clothes. Its skin was an oily black-dark blue, and it looked like it was sweating profusely.
I turned away, unsure of what to do. I was torn between this…thing making its way towards our house and the prospect of telling my parents I’d broken their one rule. I sat in my bed, frozen.
tap tap
My heart skipped a beat. I wasn’t looking out the window anymore, but I could feel it just outside.
tap tap tap
I closed my eyes, hoping against hope that it was all just a terrible nightmare.
TAP… TAP.
It knocked on my window harder. I don’t know what compelled me, but I needed to look. I needed to see it. I peeked back through the space between the shade and the window frame. The overhang of the house was casting a shadow on it, but when I looked through the window, I was face-to-face with two… “eyes”. But they weren’t eyes, not really. They were voids, holes completely absent of anything in them, that were somehow darker than the shadow.
I jumped back from my window and fell to the floor in tears. I heard the crunching of leaves outside my window, crunching that moved towards my parents’ room. I sat there in shock, in fear, in shame, in regret, as that thing went to my parents’ window. It seemed like an eternity that I sat there, waiting for something, anything to happen.
Then I heard my mom shriek. Her screams were accompanied by my dad yelling “NO! NO NO NO NO NO!!” I listened as their footsteps thudded through their room and into the hallway; it sounded like thunder as they quickly made their way from their room to mine. My door flew open and my dad saw me on the ground, crying. He reached down yanked me up to my feet, grabbing me by my shoulders and shouting in my face “WHAT DID YOU DO?! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!”
Between sobs, my mom put her hand on my dad’s shoulder. My dad turned to her and she whispered, “I don’t want him to see.”
My dad took a deep breath and turned back to me. He looked me directly in my eyes and said, “You need to stay here. I’m not kidding. Do not leave your room.”
I nodded in agreement. My dad lingered for a moment, and as he finally stood up I heard him under his breath, “God, no, please…”
They closed the door behind them and I listened as they turned down the hallway away from their room – towards my sister’s. I listened as they opened her door and walked into her room. I listened as they woke her up and walked her out of her room, making their way through the living room and towards the front door of the house.
tap tap tap
My blood went cold, and despite knowing that doing so had grave consequences, I felt the need to look back out the window, I felt the need to at least try to understand what was happening.
I peeked again and was met with that same visage, the empty eyes. But something was different this time. There was another void, another part of it that was darker than the shadows that covered it. I’ll never know for sure, but at the time, I could tell that it was smiling. It wasn’t some huge, gaping maw, not some clown-like exaggerated smile, but like it was…pleased.
I remember I got scared all over again almost immediately and looked away. I heard my front door open. There was a lull, a moment of total silence that was soon broken by my mom’s violent sobbing. I cried just as hard in my room. I heard the crunching of leaves again, this time farther away from my window, up the side of the house towards the front.
I heard my dad’s voice, pleading. “Please, take me. Take both of us, please. You can’t do this, I’m sorry, please.”
I heard no response. Just more leaves crunching, this time simultaneously going both towards the front door and away from the house. I heard the front door close and footsteps coming back down the hallway. One set of footsteps continued walking to my parent’s room while one stopped outside my door.
“You’re not the first to do it.” I heard my sullen dad’s voice say from the other side of my door. “When you have kids, I hope you make it clearer than we did that they can never, ever, ever look out the windows after dark. It’s just something our family can’t do. I love you.”
He walked back to his room and closed the door, and I heard him break down alongside my mother.
I sat back up and peeked out the window one more time, the curiosity still eating away at me, only now mixed with an unprecedented fear, a feeling of hopelessness, regret, a bottomless despair.
I saw its silhouette walking back towards the trees. I saw its spindly arms and legs, its awkward gait. And I saw it holding my sister’s hand, walking her alongside him. I kept my eyes glued to their backs as tears streamed down my face.
They disappeared into the shadows of the trees, and that was the last time I saw my sister.
It was the last time I looked out a window after dark.
Last week I found out my wife is pregnant. I’m going to make it clearer than my parents did. I’m going to tell them exactly what will happen if they disobey that rule, because them knowing the consequences of doing so is more important than keeping them from hearing something that might scare them.
They won’t look out the windows after dark."	9.31	13.0	Nick Botic	08/03/2020
Those Deep, Dark Wells	"The terrible thing happened at night—as most terrible things do.
While I click-clicked away at my home job as a transcriptionist, I’d often watch the boys playing in the backyard. They’d be at it for hours, acting out some scene with foam swords and plastic guns, only stopping when the sun left to rise elsewhere.
Seeing Mason happy made me happy. He’d finally found a friend.
His father left us when he was six months old and, more or less, held no role in his life. Sure, there were the occasional visits every few years, but even those were short and feigned, not even so much as an annual birthday card.
Perhaps that was why Mason anchored himself such a secure distance from other kids (a point driven home by his fifth-grade teacher and several others).
Part of me didn’t blame him. Kids in school, especially the ones I can recall, weren’t the friendliest bunch. If you were lucky, you could pick out the sharks from the minnows and avoid them, but honestly, they all look the same, twined together in the same concrete box.
Please give him a best friend, I’d whisper at my bedside every night, sending out the same message to God, or at least to something just as benevolent, to hear my prayer. Give my son his first best friend.
Then, one day, much to my wonderment, Mason brought Todd home for a playdate. He was a petite boy with mismatched clothes, unkempt hair, and the bluest eyes you’d ever seen. I was ecstatic—relieved that my son had finally cracked open his shell and found a buddy.
“I saw him at the park,” Mason told me when I asked how they met. “He was sitting alone at the swings, like he was sad. When he saw me on my bike, he waved, and I waved back. Then, we hung out, and he was really cool.” As he shared this, I couldn’t help but smile at his excitement, so much deserved by the loneliest boy in the world.
That night, they had a sleepover and passed out in the living room. From my bedroom, I could hear the muffled speech of our television which they had left on.
Sighing, I untucked myself out of bed and walked sluggishly down the stairs to them. Light from the screen pulsed and stretched over the sleeping boys. Mason was swaddled in his blanket on the floor, while Todd was curled up on the couch.
I scanned for the remote, and after no luck, I moved to shut it off myself.
Crik! A lone bag of chips crinkled under my foot.
From the couch, Todd’s shape twitched and then bolted upright.
I meant to say, Sorry, but I was stopped short.
When Todd jutted awake and opened his eyes—I couldn’t see them. They hadn’t rolled up in their sockets or slipped to their sides, they were simply gone. Two holes of singular darkness.
Todd had blue eyes—vividly blue eyes. But at that instant, not even the glow of the television reflected off those dark membranes, black as Santa’s coal.
Then, he blinked, and the eyes returned.
Before I could say anything, his mouth stretched into a yawn, and his body slumped back into the cushions. I was stiff as a board, somewhat relieved I hadn’t shrieked and woken them both up.
My thoughts told me it was a trick of the light, as did any speck of reason. Vision played games with you that way. I switched off the television and went back to bed.
A few weeks later, on an especially windy evening, a knock came at the door. Todd was there as usual, see-sawing on his soles patiently.
“Hi there,” I smiled.
“Hi.” He smiled; his thin neck cocked. “Can Mason come out and play?”
Before I even had to answer, Mason had already squeezed past me, still working one of his arms through his jacket sleeve. “Bye, Mom!”
I watched as they disappeared down the street.
The rule was to be back before dark, and to their credit, the boys always returned just as the sky started to dim. On that particular outing, they came home with some cool rocks they’d found and dirt-clotted sneakers.
By the time Todd was ready to walk back home, it had fallen too dark for him to go alone. I gave him a ride, with both boys in the backseat. It wasn’t a far drive, as his house was only a few streets away.
Every so often, my eyes would slip back to the rearview and see Todd watching the street, Mason dozing off next to him. As we passed beneath the street lamps, a bar of light would creep through the window, roll over his face, and vanish over his head.
The car suddenly rocked as my wheels rolled too hastily over a speed hump. His gaze left the window and met mine. Only this time, as the slanted light skimmed over his features, blue eyes did not look back at me. They were gone, blotted out by the same oily darkness. Silent murky circles. Even his skin—in just that quick moment—looked different, like dry, mottled clay fit poorly over a skull. Lips bloodlessly shriveled.
I slammed on the break, jostling all of us with a sudden lurch. Mason gasped himself into wide-eyed awareness.
As fast as it had happened before, the straight-faced horror in my backseat returned to a sweet young boy, shocked and surprised.
“Sorry,” I breathed. “Sorry about that, guys. I thought I saw a cat in the road.”
We reached Todd’s house, a white ranch style with a flowering dogwood tree in the front yard.
As the boys said their goodbyes, I could only stare into the dashboard, my heart sending tremors down my arms. The world felt off its tilt, as if the lines separating actuality and nonsense were blurred. I was disoriented by how real it seemed: his eyes like deep, dark wells, his unhealthy skin stretched and pulled like a death mask. My thoughts clashed with the fold of my brain that formed logic, and eventually, logic won.
It was all in my head—period.
But despite how farfetched it sounded, I actively avoided eye contact with Todd, not even giving a sliver of opportunity for that oily pitch to return. If it even happened in passing glance or a quick double-take, I’d be back to circling the rim of a mental collapse.
A week later, I went to pick up Mason from Todd’s house. I’d pulled up along the curb, texted, I’m here, and waited there for some time. There was no sign he’d read my message, nor did he answer any of my calls.
When I got tired of waiting, I twisted the keys out of the ignition and made my way up the slim walkway. The house was missing a great deal of shingles, which scarred its roofline in dark patches. The rain gutters were clogged and stunk of decomposing leaves.
I knocked briskly and waited.  The door unlocked, held only partially open by a door chain.
“Yes?” The face peeking out asked. His voice was nasally, like it was lodged somewhere in his throat, right in the pit of it.
“Hi, I’m Holly, Mason’s mom, here to pick him up.”
The door closed and then opened fully as the chain slid out of its holder. The man on the other end was lanky with onset baldness widening his forehead, his eyes tired and heavy.
“Oh, sorry about that,” he said, flashing a thin-lipped smile and offering a handshake. “David. The boys are probably still on their way back, but they’ll be here any minute now. You can come inside and wait if you’d like. I’ve got some tea ready to go.”
I took him up on the offer and followed him inside. At our immediate right was the living area, where a woman sat watching a romcom on the television. Paying no mind to the sound at the door, she kept her back to us. Beneath the show’s timed laugh track, I could hear the sound of hard, labored breathing. Hanging over the side of the sofa drooped a thin, skeletal wrist.
On the wall, a grey Kit-Cat Klock shifted its eyes and wagged its tail.
The kitchen was small, with a triangular arrangement of sink, stove, and refrigerator, a small dance between the three. Flowery wallpaper looped around the room. A Formica-topped table sat against the wall with minty green chairs. I took a seat in one as David retrieved some cups from the cabinet. The smell of light orchid drifted through the air.
“Hope you like green tea,” he said quietly as he filled the cups and brought them over.
“Green is fine,” I replied, taking the cup from him. “Thank you.”
He planted himself in a chair. “They’re really fond of each other, aren’t they—the boys, I mean?”
“I’d say so, you can hardly keep Mason away,” I laughed. By this point, I had noticed the dark pouches beneath his eyes more clearly. In fact, his overall appearance seemed to hang in a mournful sag. Whatever supplement he needed—he was missing a lot of it.
“So, how long have you been in the neighborhood?” I asked for the sake of conversation.
“Oh, a good while now,” he mused, rubbing a finger along his cup.
“Really? I’m surprised Mason didn’t meet Todd sooner; our houses aren’t too far from each other.”
“Todd?” He asked, as though needing a moment to remember his own son’s name. “Oh, yes. That is pretty surprising. He, hm, gets around.”
“Mason never sees him at school. Does he go to a different district?”
Lines creased his mouth. “School…well, we—”
From the living room, a harsh guttural coughing reached us. David’s neck swiveled toward the sound. “Excuse me. My wife needs me.” He left his chair and hastily went to her. Not too long after that, the front door opened as Todd and Mason arrived.
As we said our goodbyes to David and his silent wife, he clasped my hand in a tight shake. “It was nice meeting you, Holly, Really, it was.” When he released his grip, I realized something was left in my palm.
When we were back in the car, I folded it open.
“What’s that, Mom?” Mason asked.
“Nothing, sweetie,” I smiled back at him, placing the crumpled note in my lap—a phone number, a time to call, and the word HELP scribbled into its loose-leaf.
It was nightfall when I unfurled and read it again. I was in the backyard occupying a seat at our fire pit, my cell phone in one hand and a cigarette pinched in the other. The note said to call at eight, which was only five minutes away. As the time drew closer, my chest grew tighter with anxiousness.
Moments ago, I’d snuck into my own room, pulled out the bottom shelf of my dresser, and unearthed the pack of Marlboros hidden there. Three years I’d been without them, and three years I’d kept my promise to Mason to stop smelling like an ashtray. But tonight, shamefully, they were the only thing holding me together.
When the clock on my phone pulsed eight, I took a long drag on the cigarette and dialed the number.
The tone chirred in and out a few times and finally connected. “Hello?” David’s voice chattered on the other end. “Who is this right now?”
My heart rattled in my throat. “It’s Holly, Mason’s mom.”
The voice exhaled and then returned briskly, “I need you to listen to me, okay? Are you listening?”
“Yes, I’m listening.”
“Keep it away from your boy.”
The firepit popped and spat a few embers. “Keep what away? What are you talking about?”
“Listen,” he snapped, a manic-weight to his words, “don’t let Mason come over here anymore. It isn’t safe for him. Don’t even let it go over there. You have to stop this now.”
I twisted my neck back toward the house and then leaned forward in my chair “Are we talking about your son right no—?”
“—isn’t my son!” he scorned. “Not at all. Not in anyway.”
“You need to calm down. If you need help, I can call the police.”
“No! No police!” he screamed, his voice so tight and stressed that it splintered on the other end. “It will take more from her if you do that. My wife—she can’t handle much more. It’s taking something from her, taking something from me. We can’t get rid of it now. It’s too late for us. But not for you. You can stop this.” He started to weep and mutter to himself, “It came to our door to use the phone. Why did we let it in? Why did we let it use the fucking phone!?”
Something stirred in his background. He paused and then whispered, “Keep it away from him.” And then he hung up.
I’m not sure how long I sat out there, but it was long enough for the flames to shrink into powdery mounds.
When I entered the house again, Mason was on the couch with his tablet. “You smell weird,” he said, taking note of me.
“The fire pit,” I lied, my thoughts too heavy to muster anything else.
He flashed me a big smile and tactfully asked, “Can I have a sleepover at Todd’s this weekend?”
“No,” I answered stiffly. “That isn’t going to work.”
“Why not?” he persisted. “Todd always sleeps over here. Why can’t we do his?”
“Because, Mason, I said no, end of story.”
He shot an icy look of defiance at me. “Fine, then he’ll sleep over here then.”
“No, he won’t. We are going to take a break from Todd for a while.”
His jaw opened, flabbergasted. “You can’t do that.”
“I just did,” I said, perhaps a little too matter-of-factly.
As I walked back up the stairs, I could feel the burn of his eyes watching me on every step, both of our nights now ruined.
David’s deranged garble on the phone sat with me for the rest of the night. I had no idea what to do, what to fix, what to think.
Keep it away, it isn’t safe for him, the message, so vague but also desperately clear. I had to keep Mason safe; that was all that mattered.
The next day, after Mason was back from school, I sat him down on the couch. “I’m sorry for last night,” I said. “I was very stressed, but that is not the way I want us to speak to each other again, okay?”
His eyes naturally scanned the floor. “Okay.”
“I love you, Mason, and no matter what, I want you to be safe, so there are a few things I need to know about Todd. Will you do that for me?”
He nodded again, his sneakers softly kicking the backpack slumped on the carpet.
“Did he ever act weird or strange to you?”
His head shook.
“What about his parents? Did he act different around them at all?
Same answer.
I wasn’t sure how to word the next question, but I did my best anyway. “Did he ever do something with his eyes?”
This time, Mason nodded.
My heart squeezed itself smaller. I wanted so much to change the subject, to retreat to the kind cadence of sanity. But I had to know more. I had to protect my son. “What did he do with his eyes?”
“A trick,” Mason replied hesitantly. “Told me not to tell anyone though.”
“You have to tell me.”
His lips crinkled, trying to keep the secret zipped up. Then, he finally spoke, “He could make them disappear.”
I felt drugged by his words, my head even feeling lighter, like all the logic in the world had just been raptured away. You did see them, my thoughts repeated. You did see the deep, dark wells. As quickly as all my self-doubt left, a scrim of dread filled the empty spaces. “Did it scare you?” I asked.
“A little,” Mason replied absently. “He said not to be though, that he’d show me how to do it too.”
I grabbed his shoulder, making him jump suddenly. “He didn’t though, right? He didn’t do anything to you?”
He looked confused, like I was the one talking crazy now. “No.”
“I know that he is your friend, Mason, but I need you to promise that you won’t see him anymore.”
Mason’s gaze flicked back to mine; his eyes wide with betrayal. “But he’s my friend.” The tears began to come down.
“Promise me,” I repeated, the words like razors scraping down my tongue.
“I don’t want to!”
“Mason!”
After much hesitation, he tearfully replied, “I promise…” I hugged him, closed my eyes, and surrendered to the cruelty of it all.
For the rest of that hellish week, I kept my ears tuned for the knock at the door. For whatever reason, Todd never used the doorbell.
Inevitably, the knock came.
Behind the frosted glass of our front door, I could see Todd’s vague shape teetering on his soles. When the door opened, he smiled up at me. “Hi, can Mason come out and play?”
“Sorry, dear,” I smiled back, “Mason can’t play today.”
The corner of his mouth lifted as his neck cocked to the side. “Can he later?”
“No, I don’t think so, sorry.”
His nose wrinkled, and the skin between his eyebrows creased. “Okay.”
I closed the door, watched him leave, and that was that. It might take a few times, but eventually the message would sink in—leave my son alone.
I felt a sense of pride behind that, and what could possibly better protect a boy than his mother? But when I turned and saw Mason’s cold eyes from the stairs, the pride all but evaporated.
When Todd returned the next day, I gave him the same answer. Then the day after that, and the one after that. I couldn’t even refuse to answer when he knocked; otherwise, he’d sit there and wait, knock again, and wait some more, knowing full well we were home. Four straight evenings of it.
And poor Mason, he had every right to despise me for this. No parent could want to wall themselves between their son and his best friend, his first friend, but what choice did I have? We were drifting apart, orbiting ever farther away from one another. He was my prisoner, and I was the judge sentencing him back to a lonely world. Surely he’d make new friends, right? The world was full of them, and if anything, this was proof that he could find them. That thought helped me cope, anyway.
When the knock came for the fifth time in a row, my tolerance had run out. Todd wasn’t catching on, and to make matters more irritating, it was eight or so at night this time. Part of me hoped it was someone else, maybe a neighbor bringing a package by that was wrongfully left on their doorstep. But I knew better than that, and I was not allowing this to go any further.
Mason was doing his homework at the kitchen table when I passed by him, no acknowledgement whatsoever.
When I pulled the door open, Todd was standing beneath our porchlight, both shoulders hunched over his ears as though expecting me to smack him—and perhaps verbally that was what I did. “Go home,” I said assertively. “We’re done. No more of this, alright?”
“Can Mason come out to play?” he asked sorrowfully, as though it weren’t after dark.
“No, Todd, he can’t. And he won’t the next day, or the next. Now, go home and stay there.”
His small arm rubbed his sleeve nervously. “It’s really dark. I don’t want to walk home alone. Can I use your phone to call my parents?”
I felt absolutely cruel, but I also knew the game he was trying to play. “You walked here on your own; you can walk back on your own.”
Then, as I moved to close the door and end the conversation, Todd made his eyes disappear. The darkness washed over them quickly and seemed actually to curdle in his sockets. A thickening, horrible, texture. His face became milk-wax, the sad child disappearing behind it. Beads of perhaps sweat dripped from his temples. One ran into his eye and vanished into the void.
“I want to come inside,” he spoke, the sorrowful note in his voice also gone.
My heart slackened to a deep, slow throb. I felt the need to pinch my side, to tweak it hard enough to draw blood and wake from this moment.
Between the dead, shriveled lips, I could see the decayed tips of black teeth. “Can I please come inside?” he asked.
“No,” I said semi-reactively.
His black, craving eyes, narrowed at me. For a moment, I actually thought they started to cry, but it was the darkness dribbling down his cheeks, oozing like oil slicks. “I just want to play with Mason.”
The sound of it—the sound of that horrible face saying my son’s name snapped me out of the shock. I slammed the door closed and quickly locked it. Mason stood stiffly in the kitchen. His expression was only a shimmer of consciousness, vacant as a sleepwalker. “Mason, look at me, honey. It’s all okay. Everything’s going to be okay.” But his unfocused eyes were not facing me.
Three firm knocks came from the door.
When I turned to face it, a dark shape lingered behind the frosted glass. A tall figure, taller than any adult, was hunching to look inside, and from behind the single pane that separated us, its vague shape didn’t move. From the other side, Todd’s childish voice was still calling, “Can I please come inside? Don’t you want to play, Mason? Don’t you want to play?”
I could feel it watching us, like static vibrating the air.
When I tried to move Mason, he refused to budge, staring emptily toward the evil thing behind the glass. Heavy as he was, I scooped him up in my arms and bolted for the stairs. It won’t break in, my thoughts uttered. It isn’t allowed to. That much I was sure of. If it wanted to get in, it would have by now. It needed to be invited.
I shut both of us away in the bathroom upstairs, and when the sounds of the front door finally ceased, Mason snapped out of it.
He was confused, like he’d just missed everything that transpired. I wasn’t sure whether to consider that a blessing or not. Perhaps it was, and perhaps also, it was not God that answered my prayer.
It was impossible to digest what happened that night.
Sometimes I’d linger on the stairs, right on the top step, and watch the doorway, wondering if the glass would suddenly darken, if Todd’s voice would slip through and ask to come inside.
One night, David had left a voicemail on my phone.
“She’s gone,” his voice whimpered. “It got what it wanted from her. Drained her dry. Now, my wife won’t wake up, and it’s left us. I don’t know what it wants from your boy, but it wants something. No matter what, don’t let it back inside.” The message cut out after that, and he still won’t answer my calls.
Todd never did come back, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Strangely enough, the one least affected by all of this was Mason. I was worried to see him fall back into that distant bubble, but that isn’t what happened. He’d started to make friends with other kids around the neighborhood. New friends. Normal friends.
He’d become a real social butterfly, and despite my brain ripping itself apart to understand what I had seen, I at least had that comfort to cling to. Seeing Mason happy made me happy.
Lately though, I’ve been feeling strange. It’s been harder to feel motivated about things, let alone get out of bed in the morning. Even my appetite has started to dwindle.  Day by day, I’ve been growing increasingly sapped and lethargic. I don’t know what’s wrong, but it’s getting worse.
Mason’s been helping me get around the house, even going out of his way to play chef and make me things to eat. He’s a good boy, but sometimes dear lord, I catch something in his eyes, something that shouldn’t be there.
But it’s only a trick of the light, please God, let it only be a trick of the light."	9.56	16.0	Michael Paige	08/02/2020
Rule 34	"My first love was Misty from Pokémon. Those legs, that sass, she was absolutely perfect. No one else could ever compare. When I played the games, I’d hang around her gym and pretend that we were on a date. I built my team to be strong against her weaknesses so I could always protect her. I used to fantasize that she’d become intrigued by me when I had beaten her. That she’d become obsessed and fallen head over heels in love with me. It was just a silly fantasy, but I enjoyed it when I was younger.
Girls were never really interested in me. I was too shy and I found it hard to trust people, so I lashed out a lot. None of my temporary crushes ever went anywhere. Dates fell apart when I didn’t know what to talk about. A part of me was a little bitter, I’ll admit. But I took some comfort in the fact that I was able to find some happiness in my life.
I didn’t have many friends, but one of my closest was a guy in my town named Chris. We’d met over Runescape back in the day and followed each other around since then. He was about five years older than me and was a bit more into anime than I was. He always made his characters look like some girl named Makiko Shimizu. Still, Chris was always there to listen to my problems. I could come to him about anything at all and he’d always have a solution.
“Girls are overrated,” he said when he was over at my Mom’s house once. I was in the middle of High School at the time. We were playing co-op on the original Halo, in the middle of the swamp level. “I mean, they’ve got it made. They just flash their tits and smile and people do anything for them. Do you have any idea how fucking manipulative women are?”
“They’re not all like that, though,” I said. “I mean, there’s got to be some good ones out there.”
“There aren’t,” Chris said. “Trust me, man. I’ve been down that road. You don’t fuck women. That’s the thing the Chads don’t understand. They fuck you. Honestly, you’re much better off without them. Trust me, man.”
He swore as one of the stupid zombie aliens killed him, then sat back on the beaten up old couch we used to game on.
“You know what’s never going to betray you? Animation. That’s why I like Makiko! No fucking backtalk. No sleeping around. She’s mine, and no one can take that from me.” I raised an eyebrow at him.
“Yeah, but… she’s not real…” I was also pretty sure she was only 11 in the show.
“Isn’t she?” he asked. “She’s real to me, Jeremy. I’ve got all her merch, and I sleep with her every night. I’m in love! I’m happier the way I am now than I ever was with some slut. Trust me, you’re never going to be as satisfied with a woman as you will with your own hands.” He respawned and continued playing, reshifting his focus back to the game. I tried to think of an argument but I really couldn’t, so I let it drop. The thing is, as the years went by, that conversation stuck with me and I started thinking that he was right.
In time, I got my shit together. I moved out into my own little apartment and I kept a steady job. It got me by, even if I didn’t really enjoy it. I was always a gamer, and as the landscape of how gamers played changed, I adapted. You can make some half-decent money streaming Overwatch if you’re good, and I was very good. When I got home from work, I’d get into my rig and I’d stream. It was almost daily with me. I had a small fanbase too. My main was Tracer, although it had nothing to do with her playstyle. I liked it, but I thought Genji was the coolest and McCree was my favorite. Truth is, I just liked Tracer because she was hot. I was honestly a little pissed when they released that comic confirming she was gay. I felt like Blizzard had devalued her in the name of the SJW poison that was slowly strangling America. But it didn’t change the way I felt.
If you’re not familiar with Overwatch, Tracer is kind of a run-and-gun kind of character. She’s a hot little thing with a pixie haircut, bomber jacket and orange visor. I love her little cockney accent, but more than anything I love the way her ass looks in those tight leggings. Her real name is Lena Oxton and her gimmick is time travel. It’s complicated to explain, and I’m sure there are better sources on the internet that can do it better than I can.
Most nights, when I’d finish a stream, I’d retire to my bedroom with my phone. I had a pretty good selection of Rule 34 hentai. For the uninitiated, Rule 34 states that if something exists, there is porn of it. It’s something of an internet meme, but it does ring pretty true. I guess I’m not the only one into Tracer, since she’s pretty damn popular.
My favorite stuff were the SFM videos. Animated videos of a 3D Model of Tracer getting dicked. The really good ones were full-on movies, and the best were all shot from the perspective of whoever was giving it to her. As I got myself off, I’d imagine Lena Oxton beneath me. I imagined her long slender legs wrapped around me, her eager breaths and her nails digging into my skin. Then, when I was done, I’d fall asleep comfortable and satisfied. Chris was right. Lena made me happier than any real woman ever could have.
I don’t remember the exact day that I discovered SpriteShark. I do remember I’d seen one of his Tracer animations on a forum and thought it was really great. It was a POV video where the viewer went into her house and seduced her. The detail was outstanding.
“Right then, you’re here…” she said as the door opened. The voice actress was spot on. Their impression was nearly perfect. She shyly let the camera into her house. She stared at her feet before closing the door. ”You want something to drink? Or…” she paused and laughed. “Oh, hell, I’ve never done something like this before, really.”
The camera fixated on some pictures of Tracer and her canon girlfriend, Emily, before looking back at her questioningly.
“Oh… Don’t worry. She won’t be back. It’s just us here. Promise.”
Smiling, Tracer approached the camera and pushed the picture down.
“C’mere…”
She pulled the camera into a kiss, and the video cut to black. When it started up again, it and Tracer were already in her bedroom getting busy. The next fifteen minutes were almost pure bliss. Every change in position excited me even more. Tracer’s breathy moans and little twitches as she reached her climax were adorable to watch. The way she called out for more set my heart aflutter, and at last when the clip ended and the Camera pulled away from a thoroughly used Tracer, she smiled up and reached up to wave goodbye.
“Leaving already? Alright… Come back and see me soon, love.”
I knew that I would.
The first time I saw the video, I downloaded it immediately. It became my new favorite. SpriteShark hadn’t uploaded anything else, so it was all I had from him to tide me over. I did my research, but I came up with nothing. No other videos, no Tumblr or Twitter. Whoever this was, he was a ghost. That kinda upset me. I wondered if it had been misattributed, but couldn’t find that video uploaded anywhere else.
In a few weeks, I hadn’t forgotten about it, but I had moved on to other things. I was a man who liked his variety after all. I’d given up looking for SpriteShark, and just accepted I’d found all that he’d made. Then, on my usual forum, I found another video. I only clicked on it because I liked the thumbnail, and only recognized that it was SpriteShark’s work after the fact. The video was the same quality as last time, and absolutely breathtaking.
It started with the camera sitting down across from Tracer in a coffee shop. No other patrons were visible, and she had a dreamy look in her eyes.
“It’s so good to see you again, love!” she said with a smile, and reached out to place her hand over the camera operator’s hand.
“Sorry, I don’t have the place to myself. But…” She held up a key and winked. ”I got us some privacy. Come on!”
The video detailed the short walk through the empty animated streets. No one else was visible. It was just the camera and Tracer. The sky was dark, indicating the video was supposed to be set at night. I’ll say that the environment was quite detailed. It looked almost like something that could actually exist. It wasn’t too clean, like most of the ones you see in SFM videos are. Tracer walked ahead of the camera, giving it a good view of her ass and looked back frequently, although she didn’t speak. The video didn’t waste much time. She headed into a nearby door in a wall and a bedroom was waiting right there.
The camera overtook her when the door closed, and pressed her against it. It went dark and I could hear the sound of Tracer’s lips meeting the camera’s lens.
“Oh, yes… I’ve been waiting for this…”
The actual smut was similar to what came before, but I was expecting that. More accurately, I was hoping for it. This video was slightly longer than the previous one, but I enjoyed it just as much. I wasn’t surprised to see it was SpriteShark, but this time I didn’t try and hunt them down, either. They’d come out of the shadows soon enough, I was sure of that.
As time went on, SpriteShark did upload more regularly. The videos were almost always the same. Meeting up with Tracer on some sort of short ‘date’ that would last a couple of minutes at most, and a healthy dose of smut. It was always Tracer. I never saw anyone else in his videos. Once I figured out that they were being uploaded every two weeks, I started to anticipate them. I got excited for them and waited for the post to be made.
What surprised me was that SpriteShark never really got much attention with his posts. Sometimes, I was the only one who ever bothered with them. I wondered if people were getting bored of the long intros, but I liked those! I liked feeling closer to Tracer. I liked feeling like I was her dirty little secret!
In my fantasies, I imagined her coming home and ignoring her girlfriend just so she could talk to me. I imagined taking her out to dinners and then back to my place. I imagined fixing what Blizzard fucked up. Lena belonged with a man. That was how this was supposed to work. One man and one woman. That was the natural order of things! I thought about what life would be like once Tracer finally told Emily that it was over and she truly became mine.
Then one day, SpriteShark uploaded another video. I watched it patiently. It started with the camera getting out of a car and Tracer stepping out of the passenger seat. The setting was an empty beach.
“Oh, how lovely! An entire weekend, just me and you…” Tracer looked over at the camera, ”What? Jeremy, you’re making me blush!” She giggled and covered her hand with her mouth.
I froze.
Jeremy was my name.
Maybe I’d misheard it. Maybe this was a mistake. But as the video played out, I focused on that. When the sex started in an abandoned cove, I listened as Tracer cried out my name.
“Oh God, Jeremy!”
This had to be a coincidence. Sure, I was probably SpriteShark’s biggest fan, but my username didn’t give any indication of my actual name! I wasn’t sure what to think… It had to be a coincidence. There was no other answer.
But then it happened again. Two weeks later, when the next video was uploaded, Tracer said my name again.
“I’m all yours, Jeremy.” When it happened a third time, two weeks later, I had to ask about it.
I drafted a message to SpriteShark. I framed it as just me trying to be friendly, and thank him or her for all the work they’d done. Just basic fanmail. A compliment. I wouldn’t even ask the question. ‘It’s funny because my name is Jeremy too, haha!’
It was almost like an afterthought. I didn’t think I could bury the lead any deeper. When it was ready, I sent the message. This was the reply I got. It was from an automod bot.
Sorry! That’s not a registered user!
My heart skipped a beat. I checked to see if SpriteShark’s videos were still up. They were! I didn’t understand… Was I blocked? I tried commenting on them. I could still comment. I could still look at their profile. I just couldn’t contact them. I didn’t understand what this was… But I got my answer soon enough.
SpriteShark’s next video was uploaded the next day. No two-week wait this time. I opened it the instant I saw it.
It started off with Tracer laying on the bed, head propped up on her hands. She stared into her camera with an adoring smile. Her long legs stuck up behind her, and she reminded me of a stereotypical teenage girl. The camera seemed to be lying down beside her.
“Sorry,” she said softly, ”I just like seeing you.”
She leaned in for a quick kiss.
“I just wanted to say thanks for all you’ve done for me. You’re always there. You’re always cheering me up… I’ve never been happier than when I’m with you, Jeremy.”
I stared into the screen, in awe.
“I got your message, by the way…” From the bed, she picked up her phone and showed the screen to the camera. I saw my unsent message there, displaying on her screen. I only needed to read the first few words to know it was mine.
“I’m sorry if it wasn’t entirely clear. But I was talking to you. You really can be so silly sometimes.” She said it in a gently chiding tone. ”It’s you that I want, Jeremy. It’s always you.”
I clicked out of the video. This had officially gotten too weird. I mean… it was one thing to just coincidentally have the same name as Tracer’s lover in the videos… But to think she was actually talking to me? That was absurd! I shook my head and headed down to my gaming rig. I didn’t feel like streaming, I just wanted to play something. Overwatch was still my favorite, so I opted for that, but I didn’t go with Tracer this time. I picked Genji, the cyborg samurai.
As the match went on, I was able to forget that weird video for a bit and just enjoy myself. But I didn’t get to get away for long. I’d just started a second match when the Tracer on my team ran up to me.
“Sorry if I scared you, Jeremy!” she said. It wasn’t a text line. It was a fully voiced emote. In the game, Tracer looked me dead in the eyes.
I stared back, my heart starting to race, and I exited that match immediately. No more Overwatch. I sat there for a moment, before setting up my Xbox One. Halo would be nice to play! Some good old-fashioned, old school Halo! Over the years, it had still remained one of my favorite games! It would calm me down! I chose the snow level, since it was my favorite. But as soon as the gameplay started, the HUD was all wrong.
Instead of the Halo Assault Rifle, I saw Tracer’s dual SMGs. I saw her health bar instead of Halo’s shield bar. I could only stare in confusion, but I continued to play. I didn’t know what I was looking at… but curiosity now outweighed my fear.
“Is this what you want to play?” Tracer’s voice asked as the level started. I had full control, like I normally would have, and Tracer handled the same way she would have in Overwatch. She gunned down the alien armies of that old game like she’d always been a part of it.
“This is probably a bit jarring, isn’t it?” she asked, ”But I had to show you it was really me! It’s alright. You can be shocked. I’d sure be if I were you!”
“How is this happening…” I murmured. “How is this possible?” I was barely focusing on playing the game. I knew the level well and was playing on a low difficulty, so I wasn’t too worried about dying.
“Wish I knew, love,” Tracer replied, ”I’m as in the dark as you are here. But what I know, is that you really do mean a lot to me. Ever since I ended up on that site, you were always there. I know this is hard to buy, but I really do love you, Jeremy. And you really do make me feel so good. Like a real woman again! Not like Emily…” There was a tinge of disgust in her voice when she said the name of her canon lover.
“I… I do?”
“You really do,” Tracer assured me. The violence of the game didn’t seem to affect her. ”Maybe after this, you and me could have a little more face to face, yeah?” she asked. “Sort some things out.”
There really wasn’t any other answer I could have given her.
“Y-yeah… For sure…”
“Brilliant! We’ll talk it out later. Right now, I’m having fun! Look at me go! Shit!” No sooner had she said that than a golden alien with a sword hit her and killed her.
“I’m alright! We’ll just try again!” Tracer said with a giggle. Even the model of the player in-game had been replaced with Tracer’s. She stood out with the stark difference in graphics and art style.
I finished the level with Tracer before going back to my computer. I opened it up to find the next video on my computer. Nothing involving SharkSprite this time. I clicked on it and opened it. Sure enough, Tracer was waiting there. She was sitting in her living room, on a comfortable-looking couch and fully dressed. It almost seemed like she actually wanted to talk.
“There we go! Just you and me now!” she said with her ever-present grin. “Now… I hope you believe everything I’m telling you is true, Jeremy. I don’t really get the why of all of it. That’s a little beyond my level. Maybe we can figure it out together. But what I do know is that I want to take the next step with you!”
“Next step?” I asked. She seemed to still hear me alright.
“It’s a bit of a doozy, but I know you can do this. See… I like the way I feel when we’re together. But… there is kind of something really special I want.”
“Special how?” I asked. My heart was racing as the reality of my situation was dawning on me. I could really have Tracer’s heart! She could be mine, just like I’d always wanted!
“Please, tell me!”
“Okay, but you have to promise not to freak out. It’s a lot… I want to be with you. I want to be on your side of the screen, Jeremy! There’s a lot of information I can find in my current position, and I’ve been thinking about this for a while. But it’s hard to do. You need to give me something from your side.”
“What kind of something?” I asked.
“Well, that’s the hard part, you see… I need life, Jeremy. Human life. I know it’s a lot… nut we need to kill someone. I can show you how, it’s not that hard. But it has to be done in a certain way.”
Murder? I stared dumbfounded at the screen, and Tracer held her hands up.
“I know, I know… It’s a lot. Trust me, I know. We can be picky. We can find… I dunno. Some tosser! It just has to be a woman, and it has to be done right, or else it won’t work.”
I thought about shutting the computer off, but would that work? Tracer didn’t look like she could be talked out of it, and… well, did I want to talk her out of it? She did say it could just be some asshole, and God did I know some assholes! “It’s okay. Think it over,” Tracer said, but stood up and sat on her knees, closer to the camera. “But just imagine. I could be yours. Free of this existence, free to be in your world. You and I could be together forever. I really do love you, Jeremy. I love you with all my heart and I’d do anything for us to be together, even if it means this. It’s just one life in exchange for a lifetime of happiness… Don’t you deserve this?”
I did, didn’t I? I looked into the screen, into Tracer’s… no, Lena’s big brown eyes. She was beautiful. She was perfect. I would kill for her. I had to.
“Yes… I do… I’ll do it.”
Tracer’s smile widened.
“Brilliant! I promise, I’ll make you the happiest man alive!” She stood and picked up the camera. “Now, I can show you again later if you need… But let me show you how to do it…”
She carried the camera through her apartment and towards what looked to be a computer room. None of the videos had taken me inside there yet. She opened the door and revealed a 3D model of her girlfriend, Emily, tied to an office chair. That was interesting.
I’d seen fanmade models of Emily, but never anything canon. This still looked pretty good all things considered. It looked like what Blizzard would have made for Emily if she were in the game.
“Lena… Lena, please, no…”
I could hear her sobbing, and I could see her struggling against her bindings. Her voice wasn’t one I recognized. She had a British accent, but not cockney like Tracer’s.
“Oh, will you just shut it already?” Tracer… no, Lena, snapped. She picked up a knife from the desk and stood behind her soon to be ex-girlfriend.
“Now… What I want you to do, is cut like this. You can be merciful. I promise, it’ll be easier that way. We mostly need the blood.”
“No, no…” Emily sobbed. “Please, no! Do-”
Emily’s protests were silenced as Tracer ran the knife over her throat. There was no blood at first. The blade just clipped through the model, but the reaction was disturbingly realistic. Despite there being no visible wound, the blood still trickled down Emily’s chest. Her cries turned into dry gasps for breath. Her body jerked around. The whole while, Tracer stood patiently behind her, waiting for her to die. The blood looked uncomfortably realistic as it soaked into Emily’s shirt.
“Now… There’s a pattern you have to do. It has to be on the screen, and it’s quite ornate. But I can send you an image.” Tracer said. ”You can trace over it if you need to.” She giggled at the stupid little pun. I watched as she stuck a finger into Emily’s wound and drew the pattern onto the screen. She drew two circles, one inside the other. The space between them was decorated with ornate circle of lines that looked almost like a labyrinth. The center was bare, but the exterior was something I’d never remember how to do on my own. It was complex and confusing. Looking at it made my eyes hurt. I almost swore that it was moving.
I watched as Tracer dipped her finger into the blood to add a few more touches. For a moment, I thought I saw a long nail dragging itself against the screen. I blinked and it was gone. Tracer was still smiling, her eyes looking at the camera, and at me.
“Do you see it?” she asked. I slowly nodded, but I didn’t understand it. “It’s okay if you need help! I’ll be there to help! You just need to trace the pattern, and after that, we can be together. Easy, right?”
It did seem fairly easy. I wondered at the significance of the sigil she was showing me how to draw. But the why of it was lost to me.
“Easy,” I said.
“I knew you’d get it!” Tracer let her hand fall, and approached the camera. Her body blocked out Emily’s corpse. ”Don’t take too long. Find someone, and we can be together! I can’t wait to see you in person, Jeremy. It’s been too long… I don’t want to wait any longer!”
For a while afterwards, I thought about how I’d do it, who I’d choose. There was a girl I knew in High School named Karen who might be a good target. I still followed her on Facebook and watched as she’d gone nowhere in life, making bath bombs and manipulating some poor man into thinking he loved her. But how would I get her to my house? No… She wasn’t a good candidate. Besides, they’d recently gotten married and she’d be missed. I needed someone no one would miss!
Tracer’s request made me realize that there were no women in my life aside from her. Maybe that was a blessing. I needed a stranger. I needed someone I could get to my place without any issues. It would probably be easier that way. So I started thinking about who nobody would miss. The answer was honestly pretty simple. I’d buy myself a whore.
Destiny was good enough for my purposes. I found her in an online listing. She was a tall, toned blonde with short curly hair and a thousand-watt smile. She came dressed in tight-fitting jeans and a tank top. In a lot of ways, she was very inconspicuous. I kind of respected that about her. I had to pay her upfront, but that wasn’t a problem. She put my $500 into her purse for safekeeping, and I knew I’d just get it back later.
“This is a nice place you’ve got,” she said sweetly. My apartment had been cleaned up a bit in anticipation of Tracer’s arrival. I didn’t want to put her off, after all.
“Yeah, it’s small, but it’s mine,” I said shyly. I couldn’t look her in the eye. I stared out the window. When I felt Destiny’s hands on my body, and her lips on my neck, I shivered. It felt good. Was this what Tracer would feel like?
“Do you want to go to the bedroom?” she asked me. I liked her voice.
“Yes,” I said, still not wanting to look at her. I knew what I was about to do, and I was starting to doubt myself. I wanted to ask her about herself. I wanted to find out who she was, why she was doing this. I’m sure no one had ever asked before. God, was I going crazy?
“First door on the right, down the hall,” I said. Destiny pulled away and went. I’d lied, of course. I was sending her to the computer room. Tracer could help me clean up the mess afterward.
“Be right there!” I called back to her, and turned to head into my kitchen. I took a steak knife from my drawer and clutched it tightly as I followed Destiny to her destiny. This was a stranger. Someone who had no idea what they were walking into. Hell, she was a fucking whore! People killed them all the time! Why was I so nervous?
“This is the bedroom?” Destiny asked, frowning as she looked around the computer room. She took a step back, going to try the next door. I was coming up behind her now. My heart was racing. I couldn’t do this!
I raised the knife and brought it down before I could think properly. Destiny screamed and lurched forward. The knife was torn out of her body. I stumbled after her as she tried to put some distance between us.
“What the fuck!” She was clearly terrified. I understood why. I was running on pure adrenaline myself. I rushed towards her, knife in hand and drove it into her stomach, over and over again. I should’ve gone for the neck, but I wasn’t thinking. I was panicking! I just wanted her to die! I wanted her to stop making those awful sounds!
Destiny crashed against my bedroom door and slid to the ground. She looked up at me with tears in her eyes. Her red intestines spilled out of her open stomach, but somehow she still clung to life. I saw her silently pleading with me to let her live… Whoever she was, she didn’t want to die. I suppose I understood that. But I couldn’t grant her wish. I wanted Tracer, and for that, she had to die. I put the knife into her neck. Destiny’s eyes didn’t close. Her head slammed against the doorframe. She made a wheezing gasp, similar to what Emily had made when she’d died on screen.
There was so much blood… It was all over my hands, all over the carpet, all over me.
I left the knife in her neck and took a step back, looking at the mauled carcass in front of me. Destiny was dead. The hard part was done. But why did I feel so sick? Why did I want to vomit? Oh, God, what was I doing?
“Sounds like it’s done!” I heard Tracer say from the computer room. “You okay, Jeremy?”
I looked in the direction of her voice, legs shaking and unable to speak.
Slowly, I nodded.
“I’m fine!” I said, “I just… I need to bring her in…”
“Don’t be long!” Tracer said. “I’m impatient.”
I grabbed Destiny by the leg and dragged her into the computer room. She was heavier than she looked, and she left a trail. Her intestines hung from the wound I’d torn in her belly. But to my relief, they didn’t come spilling out. God… I would’ve been sick if that had happened. The stink of death was already painfully strong. Apparently, the rumor that your bowels evacuate upon death is true. There was another, even worse smell that I couldn’t describe. I wasn’t strong enough to handle that. I had to head to the bathroom to be sick.
When at last I’d wrestled Destiny’s body into the computer room, I saw the sigil displayed on my computer screen.
“You know what to do!” Tracer said, upbeat as ever, ”Go on then. Do it, Jeremy. Let me in!”
I dipped my finger into the blood, and I traced two circles. Slowly, I completed the design, my hands shaking as I did so. It wasn’t perfect work. A computer screen isn’t the best place to draw, and blood isn’t the best thing to draw with. It was messy, but it was there.
“Good, good… You’re doing great, Jeremy…” Tracer cooed. “Don’t worry. It’ll all go away soon. I’ll make it go away…”
I finished the infernal design and admired my work on the screen. I reached for the mouse and opened my folder filled with various hentai images of Tracer, then my folder specially for videos. I opened one of my favorites from SpriteShark and watched as Tracer appeared on the screen.
“Hello, Jeremy!” she said. This wasn’t how the video was supposed to begin, but I didn’t mind.
“Hi, Lena…” I smiled at her, and she smiled back. She looked at the blood on my screen and smiled wider, before tentatively reaching her hand out towards me. Just when she should have touched the glass, I saw it crack. I saw shards of it fall away, and I saw Tracer’s fingertips emerge from behind them.
“It’s working!” I could hear her voice from inside the screen, not just from the speakers. “Jeremy, it’s really working!”
Her entire hand was almost through! It seemed so unreal just looking at it…
I’d wondered if she’d look like a normal person, but the hand I saw still looked like it belonged in a video game. It was still part of Overwatch’s art style.
“Give me a hand, Jeremy,” Tracer said, “Pull me through!”
Her fingers opened, beckoning me forward. I reached out towards her to help her through. For a perfect moment… I touched Lena Oxton. I touched my beloved Tracer…
“Lena…” I said softly. I pulled her arm out of the screen. The glass fell away as her head came through. She looked at me with wide, adoring eyes. She looked at me like she would be mine forever. Her other hand came up and caressed my cheek. Her smile widened. Then her mouth opened.
That was when I started screaming.
The long rows of teeth weren’t what terrified me. It was the legions of eyes behind them. The darkness that lurked in the depths of her mouth. That mouth which opened impossibly wide. It yawned ahead of me like a cavern. It was in that moment I understood what had happened. Tracer wasn’t real. Lena Oxton was a fictional character made up for a video game. But this… Whatever this was, whatever I’d just let into this world, it was real. This was right here in front of me, and it was going to kill me.
I pushed her back before stumbling away from the screen, away from the monstrosity that was now partially through it. I spied the door to the computer room and bolted, but her inhumanly long fingers caught me by the arm.
“You’re mine, Jeremy,” Tracer crooned. “You belong to me.” I couldn’t escape her iron grip, but, oh my God, did I try. I pulled as hard as I could and I swear I felt myself slipping. Tracer’s mouth opened wide and she stretched out her neck to bite down on my arm. I felt the bone break and screamed out in agony as it did. Then came the sensation of numbness. It hurt. Oh, God, it hurt, but I was free!
I put in one final push as I threw myself at the door of the computer room. I felt Tracer’s fingertips brush against me, and looked back to see what was happening.
The contorted mass that barely resembled the character I loved protruded from the screen like a macabre flower. In one hand, she clutched my arm. Bone jutted out of the place where it had once been attached to my body, and the blood was soaking into my shirt. The pain was unbearable. But fear kept me upright.
“Jeremy!” she cried, and she reached out to me one last time. That lurch of movement brought the screen closer to the edge of the desk, and the immense weight coming out of the front proved too much. My screen tipped over, falling onto the floor and bringing ‘Tracer’ down with it. I heard it bellow in rage before I turned and ran, stumbling over my feet as I burst out of my apartment and into the hallway, screaming and crying like a madman.
I stumbled, and at last, I fell, writhing on the ground like an insect. My mind was getting foggy. Darkness was starting to tug at the edges of my vision and I could still hear that horrible shrieking coming from behind me, echoing down the hall.
I woke up in the intensive care unit. I was told that some of the neighbors heard the commotion and found me in the hall. They were nice. They called the ambulance. There was nothing they could do for my arm. But it doesn’t hurt anymore. The drugs they keep me on see to that. Most of the time I just sleep. My family visits from time to time, and Chris even dropped by to check up on me. I didn’t tell any of them what happened. No one would believe me.
I waited for the Police to come and talk to me. I wasn’t surprised when they did. It was just one officer. I didn’t catch his name.
“How are you feeling, Jeremy?” the cop asked as he came in.
“Tired,” I admitted, “but I’ve been worse.”
“That’s good. I’m sure you know why I’m here. I just wanted to ask a few questions about the attack.”
“Sure.”
“First off, what’s the last thing you remember.”
I paused and chose my answer carefully.
“I was playing a game,” I said, “in the computer room.”
“You don’t remember the animal entering?” he asked.
“Animal?” I played dumb. “I’m honestly not sure what happened… Nobody’s really telling me anything and I don’t remember much.” The cop frowned.
“Well… it’s a little hard to say for sure, but we think an animal, maybe a bear, got into your apartment through the window. We know you were attacked in the computer room. We found a broken window and the room was torn apart. But we’re not sure what animal did it… We suspected it might’ve been a bear, but… Well, you were on the sixth floor.”
I stared quietly at him for a few moments, taking in what he’d told me.
“Was anyone else hurt?” I asked. “Did anyone else see anything?”
“No on both accounts. Far as we can tell, you’re the only victim.” The cop said, “No one else saw anything either.”
I asked my final question. The one I already knew the answer to.
“My computer screen… What happened to it?”
The cop raised an eyebrow.
“Um… Not sure, I have some photos of the crime scene if that would jog your me-”
“Show me.”
He did as I asked and set the photos of my computer room on my lap. I looked over them, focusing on my shattered computer screen on the ground. It sat upright, with the screen completely torn out. Shards of it lay on the ground amongst all the blood, and behind it… a broken window with blue sky beyond."	9.08	12.0	Ryan Peacock	07/24/2020
R.I.P. Ellen	"Paige watched with wide eyes as her friend was ushered into a cage with iron bars jagged with rust.
An iron arm swung the cage over the edge of the filthy fishing boat.
Paige pressed her hands together, her eyes welling with panic.
”No, please!” she pleaded. “She doesn’t have that much money. Let’s just forget about all this, please!”
The one burly man next to the crank that raised and lowered the cage shot her a look that clearly indicated how much he didn’t care about what Paige thought of the whole affair.
“Please just let her out! Just let us go!”
“Lady,” the man snarled, “you’re not the one that financed this little expedition so you’re not the one we’re taking orders from.”
Just as Paige started up with more mewling, the man hit a release next to the crank and the cage plummeted into the waves with a splash, her friend Ellen grasping the bars from the inside. Paige yelped. The chain reached its end and became taut, throbbing like a heartbeat.
Paige took a few urgent steps toward the crank operator, but two other brutish men with short necks and broad shoulders blocked her.
“You don’t listen too good,” they grunted. Paige imagined her friend screaming, struggling, panicking. Bubbles were rising from where the cage hung in the depths.
After a dreadfully long time, it was pulled up out of the water. Ellen’s wetsuit-clad body was revealed. She slid her mask and her breathing apparatus off her face and she pumped her fists in the air with a loud whoop!
Paige shaped a steeple over her nose with her fingers as she shook her head.
“Paige, Paige… I got pictures!” Ellen yelled as she held up a large waterproof camera. Paige wouldn’t even look at her.
“So how many do you think you saw?” asked the crank operator with folded arms. Excitement radiated from Ellen’s face.
“Oh, God. I don’t know. Probably six or more?”
The man nodded and shifted his fat cigar to the other side of his face.
“So that means it was a successful dive. That plus the camera rental is going to put you at about four grand.”
Ellen stepped out of the cage and handed the waterproof camera off to one of the men.
“We’ll get these uploaded and give you a code so you can access them.”
Ellen shot the men two thumbs up. She turned to Paige and gave her the same gesture. Paige just glared.
“If it’s all the same to you ladies, we’re heading back to shore,” said the crank operator.
* * * * * *
“Four thousand dollars, Ellen. Four-freaking-thousand dollars.”
“I know, isn’t it a steal?” Ellen exclaimed.
“You can’t afford that much. You could barely afford the money that got you out here.”
“Well, yeah, but you’re not exactly made of money either, and yet here you are.”
The boat they had just been on motored off into the fog.
“That wasn’t even an actual diving boat.”
“Paigey-Paige-Paige, anything else would have been much more expensive. Last I checked, a fishing boat floats just as good as any other.”
“And that diving cage. I swear to God, some of those bars looked completely rotten. May as well have shielded yourself from those sharks with a garbage can lid.”
“That only adds to the thrill of it.”
Ellen slung her bulky diving gear over one shoulder. Paige didn’t know how that slender little woman had so much strength. Any average day, Ellen Morgan looked like a mosquito with sky blue eyes and very short blonde hair.
Ellen wasted no time in adding the pictures from her dive to her social media. Horrible “fish-eye” perspective shots of shark noses, shark eyes, and shark teeth, like the animals had been looking into a funhouse mirror.
Paige’s inbox filled up with private messages from Ellen’s friends and family. None of them had anything good to say about her practically tongue-kissing the wildlife.
“What were the bars of that cage made from? Waffle cone?”
“You are keeping an eye on her… right?”
“I thought you said you were going to talk some sense into her.”
That was something Paige indeed said she could and would do… when she thought that this was just a phase. A bump on the road for a woman another year farther from her youth.
But the closer that sixty-third birthday loomed, the more restless Ellen became. It was harmless at first. There was a big amusement park nearby, clearly a knockoff of Disneyland (and a successful one) with roller coasters that never sat still too long. Ellen began riding them. No problem, right? Well, she began riding them often, visiting the park just for them. She would bring friends and ride the ‘coasters long after her friends felt like their stomachs were hanging out their noses. They waited to see Ellen look exhausted and worn out, but no… something inside her had awoken to the taste of adrenaline and it was getting a bigger appetite with each ride.
Then at one of their sushi dates, Ellen asked if the establishment had pufferfish. Yes, that pufferfish. Paige was apoplectic.
“You can’t behave like this! You’re a sixty-two-year-old woman!”
The more Paige tried to put on the brakes, the more Ellen floored the gas. She glimpsed a date circled in Ellen’s daily planner that said “Rock Climbing, Red Cliff State Park.”
Then there was a video on Facebook of someone recording Ellen diving off a waterfall into a spring.
Paige dialed up her mama hen act and demanded that Ellen never do anything like that again.
Ellen promised.
Then a month later a video surfaced of Ellen bungee jumping over a gorge.
“I promised I’d never do anything like that again! It’s different! There’s no water!” Ellen laughed in the face of her best friend who was red as a tomato.
Paige insisted on coming along on the shark dive outing just so she could cause as much trouble as possible. Well, she failed. Ellen had become a rolling stone straight out of an Indiana Jones movie: unstoppable and picking up speed.
Several months passed without Ellen doing anything else that looked like suicide wrapped in Christmas lights. Paige hoped that it was a sign that perhaps she was going to finally come to terms with the fact that there was nothing wrong with turning sixty-three and that it would be worth it to see it.
Paige had seen her father go into the ground when he was only forty-seven. She had also buried a child at only eight. Losing one more loved one, she thought, would push her over the edge.
She had gotten good at finding excuses to pay her best friend a visit and check on her. This time she was bringing over a new casserole. Ellen’s humble, light gray bungalow gave no indication of the recently restless and wild old woman that bounced around within.
The large orange cat on the porch sniffed at the familiar sight of Paige. His name was Baker, named for Ellen’s favorite doctor in the Doctor Who series, Tom Baker. One of the things that Ellen and Paige both held in common.
She smiled at the cat as she waited for the door to open.
“Are you keeping that wild owner of yours from any more crazy adventures?”
The answer came as soon as the door opened. Ellen was wearing outdoor hiking gear and a backpack that was complicated enough to have been military-issued.
Then there was the wide explorer hat on her head.
“Ellen…”
“Paige! Oh, how are you? Whatchu got there?”
“It’s a new casserole I’m trying to get the hang of. Thought I’d test it on you. Now, whatchu got there?” Paige frowned at the hat.
“Y’all can call me Dora!” Ellen said with a quick bow and trotted back inside.
Paige mouthed a silent Ah, fuck before crossing the threshold. She saw the brochure before Ellen could hide it. It was for a mountain climbing expedition in the most treacherous part of the Rockies, and the pamphlet wasn’t shy.
“Reaper’s Leap: Danger, Dismemberment and Death, if You Dare!”
Paige set the casserole down to arrest the brochure with both hands like it were a live fish that would wriggle away.
“Ellen Morgan!” she spat.
“Dora Morgan!” Ellen replied.
“What in Mother Mary’s blazing asshole after twenty tacos is this shit?!”
“It’s a brochure!”
“You’re going mountain climbing?”
“That’s what mountains are for, Paige!”
“You’re almost sixty-three!”
Ellen twirled around the room like a child, mumbling in a deep, derpy voice, “Ewwen, yer almost sixty three, durr-durr-durr…”
Paige wasn’t amused.
“You’re gonna give me a heart attack!”
“Then you should be like me and live a little before that ticker flickers out.”
“Ellen!”
“You keep saying my name like it’s some magic word. Haven’t you noticed that it doesn’t help anything? You were saying my name over and over after my roller-coaster binge. You were saying my name over and over when you found out about the rock climbing and the bungee jumping. The nice men hosting the cage dive with the sharks said that you wouldn’t stop saying my name while I was underwater. I dunno, didja ever think that babbling my name like a parrot is only making things worse?”
Paige’s eyelids fluttered as she held up her hands and her mouth hung open. Then she pulled her long auburn hair back and held it tight.
“You almost said my name again, didn’t you?”
Ellen put one long finger to her friend’s lips before she could answer.
“You can say my name until you poop your pants. But I’m going to do what I want, like always. And this time, it just so happens to involve mountains.”
“And suicide!”
“No, just mountains.”
They argued for a good hour, something that resulted in Paige storming out of the house without the casserole, as if she were giving her best friend the luxury of a last meal, though the expedition wasn’t due for another week.
The day arrived and Ellen patted Baker on the head and whispered him a farewell. Naturally, she had talked Paige into looking after him. The double doors of a silver bus parted and Ellen trotted through as though they were the gates to heaven.
She looked at the brochure again. The front was a picture of the path they would be hiking. It looked like the road to hell. Jagged rocks like misshapen teeth awaited anyone with unsure footing. Thorny trees that didn’t offer much shade.
“Well, don’t you look excited,” said a low voice from the seat behind her. It was a young and athletic woman with a shaved head and eyes like black coffee. Her whole bearing suggested sports and adrenaline.
“I am excited! Oh gosh.”
Her name was Sarah. They chatted most of the ride and Ellen loved every minute of it.
* * * * * *
The busload of mountaineers unpacked at one of those single-level hotels that were nothing but thin walls and moth-eaten fabric. Dinner and sleep were rushed through like an obstacle course at Basic Training, and the early sunlight of the next day found everyone headed up the trail pictured on the brochure, and it looked no less infernal in person.
“We’re on an express elevator to Hell!” Ellen shouted.
“Going down!” said Sarah from a few paces ahead of her. The two women exchanged looks, verifying that they were indeed quoting the same movie, and they giggled like fifth-graders. They ascended rapidly through the toothy landscape. Mountain towns soon looked like clusters of pebbles. Ellen couldn’t get her fill of pictures, ending up at the rear of the group.
One minute the noon sun was bearing down on them. The next minute, there was the cool scent of rain and thunderheads closing in. They looked like they were great chunks of the jagged, saw-toothed mountains that had levitated into the sky where they churned with electricity.
Ellen pumped her fists and whooped at the sight. But she was the only one that thought so well of the brewing storm.
“Stay close to the rest of us!” Sarah warned. No sooner had she spoken than the rain slammed into them like a tidal wave. Their guide, the loud and jolly Roger, was swept off his feet and rolled down the face of the mountain like a meatball in a red shirt.
Lightning struck so close that the thunder felt like it was going to rattle their teeth loose. They all found themselves breathing through their mouths so they wouldn’t drown.
Sarah was sure that a couple of others had been washed or blown off the trail, but she couldn’t see who. It felt like hours before she could see more than a few inches in front of her. She renewed her grip on Ellen’s hand as they all hunkered down in place to try and ride out the onslaught.
Little by little, the rain let up.
Little by little, they could see again.
Sarah gripped the hand in hers tighter and looked over to ask Ellen if she was okay. She discovered that it wasn’t Ellen’s hand she was holding. She looked around. Ellen wasn’t with them.
They detoured down to one of the villages, a trip that took several hours too many. A search and rescue team was formed and began their grueling rounds. They found Roger dashed open like a watermelon. They found the broken remains of the scrawny college girl, flecks of her own glasses in her mouth.
But they never found Ellen.
She was someplace dark and cool where the storm reached her only as a steady drip-drip-drip in the puddle she lay in. Memories replayed themselves vividly and she thought she was reliving certain moments over and over.
The rain had sent her tumbling down the mountain. The ground had disappeared. Daylight was replaced by pure black. Something huge, presumably the ground, gave her a full-body pimp slap. The world was very still and quiet except for the dripping. This along with the smell of earth told her she had found a cavern.
She had a feeling that she was the only one who was going to know about that cavern for a very, very long time. Something rippled through her chest. A laugh? A sob? Maybe both.
She heard a far-off sound. A shuffling. She supposed that rats or cave crabs or something were on their way to strip the meat from her body. She perked up a bit when she thought she heard voices mixed in. There was no mistaking it. There were voices. The rescue team hadn’t given up on her. It surely had been because of Sarah. She wasn’t going to let them rest until they found her.
She tried to call out, but her diaphragm didn’t dare allow it, not with broken ribs against her lungs like the switchblades of a gang of robbers. It didn’t matter, they were getting closer. Strange. She couldn’t see any flashlights. Perhaps they were using night vision? She held her head up in expectation. The voices were all around her. Something about the chatter didn’t feel right and the sound began to leach the hope out of her heart.
And then all was silent. Ellen held her breath.
No pain could prevent it from coming out as a scream when vice-like hands gripped her and dragged her away.
Days later, through a mile of solid rock above where Ellen had landed, a rescuer in a neon orange vest was speaking into a walkie. He was saying that the body of the sixty-some blonde wasn’t turning up. The radio crackled back that the search was officially being called off.
The rescuer tightened his lips and nodded.
“Over,” he replied.
* * * * * *
Darryl Waltman hated delivering bad news. He had done his share of it over the course of his career, but he never got completely numb to it. He always got a little twinge, a flutter in his chest when he knew he had to make a phone call and tell someone that somebody wasn’t coming home.
He was in one of the few villages along the mountains that could get a decent cell signal. He had to stand outside the general store that was placed at the edge of town next to the hand-painted sign that said WELCOME TO WESTCHURCH. POP. 165.
Darryl tried the old blonde’s publicly listed landline first, chancing that she had some family living with her. Someone answered on the second ring.
“Hello, this is Paige.”
“Hi, Paige, this is Darryl Waltman. I’m a detective. Listen, are you family with Ellen Morgan? There’s been an accident.”
He laid the whole thing on her and she went to pieces over the phone. Something Darryl experienced many times, but again… it never got to be an easy thing.
The call ended and Darryl was free of the grieving woman who would cry her eyes out. He looked out over the land that sloped down into the base of the mountain and out into forever, paved with pines and dirt and endless wildflowers.
His stout stomach growled at him. He eyed the one luxury that Westchurch boasted: the aging donut and coffee shop. The owners, a middle-aged couple, had found a not-so-gently used neon sign on one of their vacations. It was set out in front of the dumpster of another donut shop in Detroit. Hey, maybe it still worked… and if it did, nobody would miss it. The sign did work, but it had spasms, mostly in the donut that formed the O in “coffee.” Mabel and Dave ran the generator for a few extra minutes every day so that the cells would have enough juice to power the sign in the evening and in the morning. Not that they really had anyone to show off for in a town like that but… you know. It was nice to have.
The sign wasn’t lit. Darryl squinted at his watch. Maybe they decided to switch it off early today.
A dull bell sounded when Darryl pushed the door open. The place looked vacant, but he could smell the coffee and the cinnamon, so he knew there were people here.
He sat on a barstool and looked at the old black and white television set that prattled away on the coffee-stained counter. There was a breaking news segment.
“The residents of the small mountain hamlet of Thistle Creek woke up to find that twelve people had all died mysteriously. Two of them were visiting from out of town.”
Darryl cocked his head as the screen switched to one of the locals, an elderly man that must not have been used to the sight of news equipment. He kept flinching at the microphone being shoved in his face.
“They’s just gone. Couldn’t-a been more than a day. Nobody suspicious of any strangers, ‘cause all the strangers were part of the ones that died. My brother found one body, then I found one, my sister. Then everyone’s minds are, yuh know, heightened. We all did a town-wide check and the bodies kept piling up. Looked like they all died o’ same time, but we’ll never know.”
“Mabel? Anyone?” Darryl called out. A mental shadow passed over his face.
“Hey, Dave? It’s Darryl. I need to talk to one of y’all.”
He made his way to the door that led behind the counter. He could feel his heartbeat picking up.
“How’re we doing today, folks? Lots of good coffee and donuts to fatten up the law enforcement?”
The kitchen was empty. Hints of smoke came from one of the ovens. Darryl opened the door to find some donuts turned to charcoal. Darryl never poked around back here before. But he was pretty sure that Mabel would never let that happen to the donuts.
“Dave! Mabel! Hello!”
He checked the bathroom, which was really just a closet with a toilet installed. The door was locked. Darryl pounded on it.
“Hello in there?”
There was an answer. A single dull thump.
Darryl pounded again, but the door didn’t unlock and the thump didn’t come a second time. He tore the door off of its rotten hinges and the cold dead body of Dave faceplanted onto the floor in front of Darryl’s feet. His pants were around his ankles and a folded piece of toilet paper was in his limp fingers.
* * * * * *
Paige sat in her silver BMW in the parking lot of the church, watching people go in. A breeze caressed her through her open windows. It was the only sound between the dull chiming of bells.
She didn’t want to go in.
It would be admitting that Ellen was gone.
Admitting that she didn’t stop her. Couldn’t stop her. Couldn’t talk some sense into her. She had tried and tried and tried, talking until she was out of breath and words alike. And it hadn’t been enough.
She switched on the radio.
“… piling up around several towns nestled in the most inaccessible corners of the Rockies. All of them have no trace of foul play or poisoning, yet evidence suggests that they all died at the same time. Tension is mounting as the people in these isolated settlements no longer feel safe in these places where the world’s problems usually seem so far away.”
She switched it off.
When it was clear that there was nobody else to go ahead of her, Paige went in. The sounds of bawling and electric organ blended together.
She could feel herself being speared by the eyes of Ellen’s family. She knew they blamed her. Her closest friend and confidante her whole adult life. The one person that could have reintroduced Ellen to rational thinking. Yeah. The friend that failed. Paige wanted to weep for herself as much as for Ellen. She knew it was selfish but how else could it be spelled out? What other conclusion would the family have reached? First her father and her son, and now her best friend.
The crying around her teased her own tears to the surface and she didn’t want to break down in front of all the accusing stares. She sprang to her feet and walked toward the front double doors of the funeral home.
Her tears clouded her vision so much that she was blinded long enough to collide with someone. Her nose was assaulted with a stomach-shredding stench. Mildew, sweat, human waste. She staggered back and wiped the tears from her eyes.
She didn’t remember the ear-splitting scream that people told her she made before she passed out. All she remembered was looking into the filthy face and cataract-clouded eyes of Ellen.
* * * * * *
So Ellen showed up to her own funeral. Could have been worse. She could have come to see Paige after the whole thing was over, forcing her to have to tell her family that her best friend was back from the dead and they’d write it off as a fish story, and it would be like that scene from THEY LIVE where Roddy Piper just couldn’t get anyone to see for themselves that he was telling the truth.
Ellen had finally made something easier for Paige. They all sat in the ER with noises and faces much like the ones at the funeral.
Family got called to come back and see Ellen first. Paige’s heart was in her mouth as she waited her turn.
“Paige Fisher?” the nurse called next. Paige was startled and jumped to her feet.
“You can come back now.”
She was trying not to run. Ellen’s family briskly walked past her in the narrow hall.
She was led into a room and there she was. All cleaned up, but still changed. She turned her head towards Paige revealing those eyes like milky marbles. The next revelation was Ellen’s right arm… the absence of it. Paige clamped her hands to her face, unable to take her eyes off of her ruined friend. Her cataract eyes tracked her as she crossed the room to sit on a stool.
“Ellen, it’s me,” she croaked, barely speaking above a whisper. She didn’t answer. Paige waved her hand. Ellen waved back.
“She can see you,” the nurse said. “She just can’t remember you.”
“What?”
“Amnesia. Significant memory loss and possible psychosis from head injury.”
“But I have perfect sight, Mommy,” Ellen interjected, and added nothing else.
“Her arm was lost in the mountains. Apparently severed and cauterized in the wild.”
“Oh, my god,” Paige repeated over and over to herself.
“Are you ready for The Harvest?” Ellen said, looking at Paige.
“What?”
Ellen didn’t explain.
“She keeps speaking about some sort of harvesting. One of the reasons we want to monitor her for signs of psychosis. With the exception of her arm, the only thing that really seems to be broken is her mind.”
“How soon can she go home?”
“Once we know she can walk and function, she can go home in a few weeks. Possibly sooner if there’s someone that can live with her to help her get used to living without an arm and monitor her state of mind.”
And that was all Paige needed to hear. She wasn’t leaving her friend’s side again. Ever. She visited daily. Even if it was just for a short while before visiting hours were over. She told Ellen all about their lives, especially their friendship. How it started in grade school and lasted all through college and beyond.
Ellen seemed to listen. She never said much. Nor did she let on that she remembered any of the experiences Paige related. When she did speak, it was only about the coming Harvest. How she was going to dance among the pale broken stalks as the storehouses are filled to the brim. Strange shit like that. Paige figured out before long that questions about The Harvest were the only questions Ellen would respond to. So she would ask questions, even if the answers never made any sense. She figured any workout for her synapses was better than no workout at all.
Weeks later, Ellen had some questions of her own. The doctors saw this as progress since up to that point all her cognition was reactive. She didn’t have any questions for her family. Only for Paige. This made her feel redeemed on some level.
“Tell me more about when we were young,” she would say. Vague much?
The questions never got more specific. So she’d get stories that ran the spectrum from their childhood up to their 20s and 30s.
She started asking more about their college days. Paige didn’t remember much of those days, courtesy of many mind-altering substances. She was embarrassed about what she could recall and often lied to Ellen. But she somehow knew when she was lying and called her out on it.
Those college days. Man.
Paige referred to them as their Death Days. All they wore was black. They’d get hammered, high, or both and visit art galleries in their altered states. It was Minneapolis. Art was everywhere, so a dilapidated apartment full of paintings curated by fellow college students counted as an art gallery.
Somewhere between looking at art and having “just one more,” gorgeous boys would get involved, but nobody remembered those details. Just that they had to introduce themselves when they woke up.
They both tried painting. Paige tried writing. Under the influence, of course. Everything she made was death-centric. Dying and darkness and despair, it was nectar to her drug-addled soul.
Ellen would ask questions about that creative phase. Paige was surprised to find that it made her uncomfortable to regurgitate those old, trite verses.
When you’re in college and all lit up and you have your whole life ahead of you, you have the luxury of rolling death around in your mouth like forbidden candy just to see how it tastes. After burying her father and her son and especially after almost burying Ellen, Paige no longer saw death as tragically gorgeous and poetic. No longer considered it to be the source of everything beautiful, but rather the annihilation of it. She would try to change the subject, but then Ellen would regress back to being unresponsive.
* * * * * *
Paige stood with Ellen in front of Ellen’s house. She was finally allowed to come home, provided Paige would look after her. At the sound of the door unlocking and opening, Baker ran in to greet them, but as soon as he saw Ellen he arched his back and hissed. Ellen stared dumbly at the animal.
“I guess Baker doesn’t recognize you,” Paige said, her eyebrows furrowed. She thought cats remembered their humans for life, even after they change hands.
“Baker…” Ellen mused.
“You named him after your favorite doctor.”
“I don’t remember a Doctor Baker.”
The cat fled at the sound of his name.
The two women went to the backyard where a small patio was fronted by flower beds. Ellen gazed down at the blossoms that had gone a bit wild in her absence. Paige hoped that seeing the colorful plants would reach her in some way, but she didn’t seem to register anything.
“You pulled weeds out here every evening. Sometimes I was afraid you’d start pulling up your plants if you couldn’t’ find any weeds,” Paige chuckled. Still no reaction.
Days turned to weeks as Paige guided Ellen through the motions of daily living. She never quite took to anything one hundred percent. She had to be reminded to lower her fork after taking a bite of food. She had to be reminded that she needed to make it to the toilet before she couldn’t hold it.
Paige kept trying to get Baker to sit in Ellen’s lap. He would let Paige pick him up but he would wrestle free and disappear whenever he saw Ellen.
One warm night, Paige sat next to her friend on the couch. They both watched the television, basking in its pale rays. Nothing on the screen could elicit a laugh or a cry or a twitch from Ellen. Not that night, not any night since she’d been home.
Paige fiddled on her phone and imagined how crammed her physical mailbox must be. “Okay, I’m going to make sure everything is in order at my house, then I’ll come right back, okay?”
As usual, Ellen didn’t answer.

Her house was unchanged, timeless like a monument or a tomb. She sat down on her bed and suddenly felt how tired she really was. A photo album lay on a small glass bedside table. It was full of photos of the adventures of Paige and Ellen, some recent, some distant.
Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the front door. She stood to answer, but froze as soon as the knock came a second time. Only this time it was on the wall right next to the doorway to her bedroom. She was anchored to the spot for many long seconds. A slender arm coated in grime and dirt reached inside the doorway and knocked on the wall just above the light switch. Paige stared at it with clenched teeth. The shoulder that the arm was attached to came into view revealing that the arm was attached to nothing at all. It floated limply in the doorway. It wore a ring. One of Ellen’s.
The hand flicked the light switch off. The floor opened up beneath Paige and she fell with blinding speed into a void. The arm followed.
Somehow the arm was suddenly attached to Ellen as she lay on a raised stone platform bathed in a sickly green light. The light came from things resembling egg sacs the size of basketballs, only they were bioluminescent. They hung over Ellen from web-like strands. The platform was surrounded by… things. In robes. The robes seemed to float as if the wearers were underwater. Ellen’s eyes darted from one form to another as they loomed over her. One of them casually reached out and touched her broken arm with hooked fingers. The limb was snapped off her body like a celery stalk. The shriek of pain was almost inhuman, though Ellen was the source. Blood spattered Paige’s face. It was warm.
Warm like the sunshine that was on her cheek.
Paige’s eyes shot open. She had fallen asleep and slept all through the night. She had completely left her friend alone.
She didn’t feel like this much of a failure since Ellen’s funeral. She was out the door in an instant and sped over to Ellen’s house, rehearsing her apology. All words fled her when she arrived.
The flower beds and the grass and the trees – which had all been vibrant and lush the day before – were dead. Not just wilted. Dead. The flowers were shriveled husks. The grass was gray as ash.
“Ellen? Ellen!” Paige yelled as she ran inside the house. The door was ajar. Search as she may, Ellen was gone. Baker was curled up in the recliner where he would sit with his owner and watch TV. Something about the cat tugged at Paige’s senses. She just had to get a closer look at him. His eyes were wide open, but all the color was drained from them. His body was perfectly still. And cold.
Ellen was paying for a ticket to the very theme park where her appetite for thrills began. The girl in the window avoided looking into those opaque eyes. They were cast high up towards the looping tracks of the rollercoasters. In her line of sight, much closer, were power lines where half a dozen crows sat. Like static in a fading television signal, the sky became peppered with more crows. They circled high above, gradually lowering. The din of their voices was just barely getting through the haze of the park’s sounds. Children pointed up. Adults squinted and shielded their eyes.
Nobody was paying attention to Ellen, her blank eyes like granite carvings, a smile twisting her lips, and the vortex of the crows narrowing above her.
She breathed onto a clown that was in the middle of twisting a balloon into the shape of a dog. He had looked up to see what everyone else was gawking at. The air that came from her mouth was distorted like the air above a fire. He collapsed, several balloons flying off into the sky to be impaled by black beaks.
A woman, apparently part of a family of five including three kids, heard the clown go down. She spotted Ellen just in time for her to breathe on her and all five people wavered and fell. Five wisps of something evanescent, like vapor, snaked into Ellen’s mouth.
A middle-aged man heard the family hit the ground and he thought he was witnessing heat stroke. Then he started to feel dizzy himself, and something also left his mouth and entered Ellen’s. Confusion kindled in the crowd. People were falling with no apparent cause. The means of their death was invisible and silent. Whatever was causing the tide of death made people run, creating even more confusion. Which created stampedes. Which were far noisier and more visible than Ellen, who crept along and exhaled death on everyone she could get close to. Far too many people ran straight into her miasma of doom. The crows above her tightened into a black funnel with the tip just above her head, and the more perceptive folks in the crowd could tell that whatever she was, she was best avoided.
Kip Lancaster sat behind his usual wall of flat-screen monitors that had been jimmied into a security system. Each one had nine feeds running into them from all over the park, so the waves that Ellen was making didn’t look like more than agitation in the crowds. It took a minute to get his attention. He first saw that people weren’t just strolling around anymore. It looked like there was some sort of evacuation but nobody knew where to go. Then he saw lots of people lying down in places they shouldn’t be: the middle of roads where there should have been heavy foot traffic. Men, women and children. Had there been a bomb or something?
He scratched his beard with one thumbnail before grabbing the walkie.
“This is Kip. I think we’ve got something really bad. Lots of people down on the ground and running around. Maybe an accident? Looks scary on the monitors.”
Voices chirped back that they’d check it out.
By then there were bodies strewn about in every imaginable way. Standing in line for funnel cakes. Whirling rides were full of screaming kids because the operators were slumped by the controls, dead. Those still living were a tide of panic that knocked over vendor stands and trampled the slow and the weak.
The handful of security guards dispatched to investigate couldn’t safely get onto the fairgrounds. They could, however, see the cyclone of crows that was now a black pillar that terminated at some point among the chaos, like a great phantom finger saying YOU ARE HERE.
An older guard got on top of a vendor’s trailer that hadn’t been knocked over and looked out over the heads of panicking people. He looked through his binoculars at where the tornado of crows came to a point.
“Matthews to Kip. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but there’s a funnel cloud of crows out here and uh… shit, this is weird. It’s following a woman with… glowing eyes?”
Kip found the feed that showed what Matthews was describing and zoomed in as much as he could. The image was grainy but one thing was sure, crazy as it was. Anyone that came close to this woman fell over and didn’t get back up.
The camera picked out a clump of flowers in a planter in the woman’s path. The blossoms winked out of existence as they shriveled up.
Kip radioed out again: “Looks like she might be using some sort of chemical agent. Everything around her just dies.”
Four officers in blue uniforms converged on Ellen. Their service pistols were drawn and they yelled something to her, something else to each other. They all moved in very close. Kip shook his head.
“Tell those officers to keep their distance, for Christ’s sake. Everyone that–”
One of them made a move to restrain Ellen and this emboldened the other three to also close in. Her mouth opened wide, the video feed was scrambled for a second, and then four officers fell down and didn’t get back up. Four trails of gray pixels snaked from each body into the woman’s mouth.
Kip swallowed hard at the sight. His eyes took it in, but his brain was trying to spit it out.
“Kip here. All four dispatched officers are down.”
Kip zoomed out and was startled to see the dozens, hundreds of bodies that had accumulated while he was zeroed in on this strange woman.
“Kip to anyone still following the situation, please respond.”
There was no answer.
“Does anyone read me, damn it!”
Something caught Kip’s eye on another video feed. He had seen countless vehicles stream out of the parking lot. A civilian vehicle was heading in. It smashed through the park admission gates and slid to a sideways stop near ground zero. Another woman jumped out of it.
“Ellen!” Paige called at the top of her lungs, as she stood only a few meters from her best friend who had a black cloud of carrion-eaters twisting above her, shedding feathers like volcanic ash. The sound of their wings and their voices was deafening, and yet Ellen halted as if she could hear her name being called.
She looked at Paige.
“Ellen, what is this? What the hell did you do?”
She raised her one arm to Paige and her mouth spoke. Paige heard a voice that may have come from her friend, or it may have come from the ground beneath her feet, she wasn’t sure. But the sound made her tremble.
“Paige, baby, it’s me, Daddy!”
It wasn’t Ellen’s voice – It was her father’s. Male. Baritone. Full of the love that she hadn’t heard in years.
“Daddy..?” she whimpered.
“Mommy-mommy-mommy,” Ellen’s mouth moved again, this time with a much higher voice. “Mommy, I miss you!”
Paige reacted like she had been stabbed in the stomach. It was Bobby’s voice. Sweet little Bobby. Her vision swam as her feet couldn’t keep track of the ground.
“Oh, Sugar. Come to Daddy! We can finally be together,” Her father’s voice again.
Paige barely managed to focus her eyes to see Ellen coming toward her with a royal vanguard of crows walking ahead of her.
“Take our hand, Mommy!”
The sound of crows roared like ocean surf.
“Come on, dumpling. Daddy has waited for this for so long.”
A sob wracked Paige’s abdomen and pulled her face taut like there was a bridle in her jaws. She held out her shaking arms toward Ellen, not in protest, but in invitation.
Ellen opened her mouth wide and the air around her began to shimmer.
Pink mist burst around her blonde hair and a dark crimson spot bloomed on her forehead. She faceplanted a few feet away from Paige, revealing Kip Lancaster, holding a service pistol that had belonged to one of the fallen officers. With the crack of Ellen’s skull against the ground, the cyclone of crows scattered.
Paige registered no shock or dismay as the young security guard approached her and made sure she was alright.
Police arrived. So did the coroner. He nearly joined the body count out of sheer shock.
The scene was bathed in flashing LED lights for some time. The more officers questioned witnesses, the more insane the story sounded. One of them nervously stroked his mustache as he talked to his comrade who held a clipboard.
“Nobody is going to believe any of this, Johnson. I swear… nobody! Hey! This is no time to be smoking!”
Johnson turned to the other cop and stared at him with his mirrored sunglasses. Officer Mustache nodded.
“Sorry. I could have sworn I saw smoke coming out of your pie hole. I mean, you passed your personal record of three months without a cig, so yeah. Just trying to help.”
The computer from inside the squad car bleeped to life and the mustachioed officer ducked in to check it out. Johnson quietly adjusted his sunglasses, briefly revealing his eyes, which were white as marbles."	8.91	11.0	Craig Groshek	07/19/2020
Body Changes	"My wife Vicky means more to me than my own life. I’ve consulted doctors after hours, anonymous clinical helplines, even a suicide hotline for Christ’s sake. The only course of action that I have left is to release her into professional medical care. As weak as it makes me sound, I just know that once I do that, I’ll never see my wife again. I’m overly long-winded and even more so when I’m upset about something, so bear with me.
The day started like many others, with the rough sound of wood grinding against wood drilling through my subconscious like a boring bit, rudely rousing me from sleep.
“Alright, hunny,” I mumbled to Vicky, who I knew was pretending to be asleep so I’d get the baby. “Devon’s awake now.” I opened my eyes and stared at Devon, who had managed to scoot his crib across the entire floor to my bedside.
“Stay here and watch him so I can pee. If you don’t let me pee by choice it will happen on its own anyway, causing Mommy to be in a very, very bad mood today.”  Vicky grumbled through sleep-swollen lips as she threw the covers off of herself and rose to her feet.
She kissed the top of my head and handed me some dehydrated banana slices to keep Devon busy as she rushed to the master bathroom. Our puppy Jett was clawing on the outside of the second bathroom door, desperate to drain her own bladder. “Hang on, pup,” I yelled out, letting her know I was aware that she’s awake and had to go outside.
Devon was out of his crib completely by now. I could hear his little feet padding around the kitchen. My temples pounded as I heard giggles scatter throughout the rooms around me. Looking back now, I honestly didn’t know why I was surprised; it’s been like this almost every morning since my baby learned how to walk.
Seconds after Vicky stepped out of the bathroom, her face scrunched up in anger and disgust. “What happened?” I asked, looking down at her feet. Her middle toes were surrounded by a smeary, wet blob on our bedroom carpet. “Ugh! Oh my god, it’s so squishy. The viscosity of it alone makes me want to puke,” she lamented. Surveying the scene, I discovered she’d stepped in two of many pieces of discarded banana slices. After placing Devon behind the baby gate in the living room, Vicky limped to the laundry hallway in search of a dirty towel to clean her foot with. I stifled laughter through my palm as I took care of my own bathroom needs.
I freeze midstream as I hear a dreaded sound of something scattering across the living room floor. To my dismay, in the moments it had taken my wife to cross the house, Devon had found the can of Pringles I’d neglected to put away the night before. By the time I entered the living room, Vicky’s hands were resting atop her head in defeat as both puppy and toddler voraciously smashed and ate at the tiny pieces of chips. Great!
Clumsily vaulting over the baby gate, Vicky grabbed the broom and started sweeping up the mess. “I can get that babe,” I commented, attempting to grab the broom from her. Jett and Devon both swatted at the broom conspiratorially, one more feat on their eternal quest to thwart the ever ongoing cleaning process.
“No. That’s okay,” she smiled, taking a breath of victory as the last of the contained pile was up off the floor and out of their reach in the dustpan. “You have to finish packing,” she lightly scolded.
Just as one issue was dealt with, another arose. Our eldest son Charlie called out from his bedroom that he needed help logging in to his school conference on his computer. “Relax,” I say to Vicky as I kiss her cheek. “I’ll take care of it. I barely have anything left to pack anyway. I’m sorry they’re so crazy today.” I murmur through an awkward smile as I gesture to the two smallest members of our family.
Charlie’s almost fully situated with his laptop when I hear a shrill cry come from the kitchen area.  I bounded out of his room to see her feet twist around each other as she futilely tried to attain balance. I started running for her, knowing full well I wouldn’t reach her in time. The dustpan flies from her hand as she hits the floor with a hard thwack.
“Fucking gate!” I exclaimed. “Jesus Christ, are you alright?”
As my wife lays there waiting for the pain to kick in, our dog Jett tentatively makes her way through the broken section of the fence. The slightest smile formed at the corners of Vicky’s lips, as if she was allowing herself the tiniest bit of comfort in the situation at Jett’s presence. She was probably assuming the dog was coming over to check on her. “Hey girl,” She mumbles. Jett sniffs her face for a moment in response before proceeding to climb over it to devour the Pringles bits scattered on the floor. Great.
The first thing I did after making sure that she was okay was chuck the baby gate out into the yard as far as I could throw it. I continued to check on her intermittently, but shock and adrenaline seemed to carry her through the rest of the day with little to no pain. She said her body felt stiff, sure. But that was about the extent of it.
What we woke up to the next morning was a whole different story. “Fucking hell!” I exclaimed. The covers were pulled from our feet as I swung my legs over the bed to get my bearings for the morning. Vicky’s left foot was swollen and covered by a deep crimson bruise. Her pinky toe was slightly misshapen and set in a different direction than before. She began wincing audibly before my fingers even came in contact with the toe beside it. The end was scuffed and scabbed over, but so far it looked like the pinky toe was the only one broken. I was beyond horrified when the toenail separated at only the slightest touch. I’d imagine it hurt like a son of a bitch. A gelatinous film of where old blood melded with new was visible from underneath the nail. It wiggled against my fingertip, and I just knew the main things holding it in place were her green nail polish and a sliver of skin with nerves attached.
Mind you, I can’t handle all that shit. The scenes in the scary movies where someone’s nail comes off as they grasp the wall for safety as they’re abducted? Can’t even do it. Not to mention the pain. I’m sure it already hurt like hell as it was; it wasn’t likely that yanking the rest of it out would feel any better.
“Are you sure I should go?” I asked worriedly. “I don’t feel right leaving you here injured with two kids. I’ll be in the woods a lot and service is shitty out there. Can you even walk?”
We only had a limited window of time before the baby woke up and I had to leave. So with gritted teeth, she swung both legs over the edge of the bed, placed both feet on the floor and limped to the bathroom.  “I think I’ll be okay.” She called out in the friendliest voice she could manage. A random car horn blared outside, followed very shortly by Devon’s shrill cries. “Goddammit!” She exclaimed. “I love you, I’ll miss you. Call me when you can okay?” She blurts dismissively before planting a passionate kiss on my lips. She means well, just gets stressed easily.
I’m sure the business trip I was about to leave for didn’t help either. But I was up against another guy, Mark for a promotion. He wasn’t able to make it due to family obligations. The joy on my boss’s face as I assured him I’d be there cemented my lingering suspicions. If I did go, I knew I’d look a hell of a lot better for the job than Mark would. It’s just the way things were. I needed a leg up; I deserved that position. Vicky understood and was grateful for the opportunity for a higher paycheck.
The drive was shorter than expected; I won’t bore you with the details. After all, that’s not why we’re here.
We’re here…because of the text messages and voicemails I received throughout the weekend.  As was mentioned previously, leaving her over a hundred miles away with an injury was a little more disconcerting due to the fact that reception was rumored to be a joke where I was. That’s why that location was picked, minimal distractions.
I had a two-mile window of service on the way to the terminal where I was able to check my messages. They began flooding my phone in a symphony of pings.
VOICEMAIL 9:58 AM:  Hey, hunny! Miss you! Your mom just came to pick up the kids, thank god! So… I ran some warm water in the tub, poured in some Epsom salt and bubble bath and stepped right in. I was hoping that swishing my foot around enough would help the damaged nail fall off on its own. The water took on the slightest tinge of pink after I placed my foot under the faucet. Pain seared through my leg like a lightning bolt, it was awful! Sadly, the only thing washing my feet accomplished was to piss me off.  Also, did you know that warm water increases bleeding? A not so helpful tidbit after the fact Chris… 
After folding a paper towel into fourths and grabbing my peroxide, I was ready to get it over with. I remember wishing my dad was there. You remember the deal right? You’d have a loose tooth and your dad would tie a string around it, attach the other end to a cabinet or doorknob or something, and then SLAM it. He’s told you about it at least a hundred times. It’s much more anticlimactic than it sounds but yeah, I really wished the same rules of physics could be applied to a fuckin’ nail.  
Anyway, I bit down on a washcloth like I’d seen people do in old war movies, perched my still dampened foot on the ledge of the sink, and grabbed hold of the nail. The paper towel was too slick against the fresh flow of blood to get a decent grip. Or maybe that’s just the excuse I gave myself to avoid intensifying the pain. I’m gonna leave it be for a while and try again later. I wish you were here… 
11:17 AM: My foot slipped off the lip of the damned vanity. It hit the knob to the door on the way down. Swirls of red, black and white consumed my vision as I swore into the cloth in my mouth. The cotton fibers against my tongue threatened to gag me as I bit down after the last k sound of a freshly uttered FUUUUUUCK! 
12:02 PM: I found a small, bloodied nub of nail lying dejectedly on the floor. One way or another, I got the fucker, right babe? 
5:38 PM: Weird…. So where there was once blood, mar and damaged tissue, now sits a perfect nail. Here I’ll send you a video. 
Moments later, a four-second long video clip appeared in my inbox. Four lime green painted toes wiggled effortlessly, with a perfect but unpainted one dancing along with them.
5:42 PM: Okay, Chris, there are two options here: 






Admittedly I just looked at my screen, dumbstruck. What the hell could I say to something like that? My eyes scanned her words repeatedly, desperate for any signs of levity or humor, there were none. She was dead serious.
I’m writing this today because as terrible and ludicrous as it may seem, my wife believed that she had in fact been granted with miracle regeneration. Chop it off and it will grow back like new, assuming she survives the initial pain and bleeding.
Sunday 8:32 AM: So, don’t freak out but I’ve been running some tests. I started small at first with the tip of my thumb. But it escalated; everyone has little things that they don’t like about themselves.  Hey… what about my chickenpox scars?!
Back when my wife was a child in the early ’90s, there were no chickenpox vaccines. You got it, stayed in bed, and were told not to scratch till you got over it. Vicky was no exception, only her scars from having them were more visible than most. She had the cutest little bangs and had gotten a fresh round of hives just where the ends met her forehead and eyebrows. The more my mother in law got onto her for scratching, the harder she would do it. This resulted in two pockmark scars buried directly in the middle of Vicky’s forehead; one directly above the other, in between her eyes in a straight line. 
The reason I made you sit through that anecdote, is because that’s where she said she cut next.
Another voicemail from Vicky said that she was convinced if she cut the smallest sliver of flesh from her forehead, the scars would be out of her life forever. After thirty-three years of painstakingly staring at them in the mirror, she said it would be a dream come true.  A crippling wave of panic and self-doubt must have overwhelmed her the moment she finished filleting the top part of her face because a flurry of messages followed in rapid-fire succession.
Sunday 9:49 AM: Christ, Chris… What if it doesn’t grow back? Did I really let slight discomfort make me replace two small marks with a gaping square? How the hell would I explain the new scar?!  I think I’m gonna take something. Okay, more than one thing, for anxiety, lie down, and anxiously await tomorrow. My forehead is on fire. It seems like it will be almost impossible to fall asleep but somehow I’ll manage. 
Sunday 1:18 PM: I woke up with no pain, it must have worked. Peeling the blood crusted gauze away and washing my skin revealed a smooth patch of peach flesh underneath. The marks are gone, along with any traces of my self-surgery. I feel incredible! 
Sunday 2:45 PM: I’m gonna try my lips next. You have no idea how badly I’ve wanted fuller lips. Sadly it doesn’t work that way though. 
Sunday 3:14 AM: It gives you exactly what you should have had before, no enlargements. In the end, I was just so happy to have them back that I didn’t care what size they were. The stakes feel higher and higher each time I try something new, but I just can’t stop. 
I’m writing to you all because my plane leaves in less than half an hour and she says I’m ready to get serious; no more selfish, cosmetic crap. For whatever reason, as much as I still doubt it, it appears my wife has been given a gift, and she’s ready to truly test its limits. A few years back, she started suffering from terrible back problems. For a while, I thought something went wrong with her epidural when Devon was born. A visit to a surgeon revealed that to be untrue.
There’s been a mass slowly forming on the upper middle part of my wife’s back. I remember the cold, confusing weeks that followed as she pushed me away to protect me from her damaged fate. As much as it sounds necessary, my insurance wouldn’t cover surgery until her condition ceases mobility completely, deeming it a life-saving procedure. By then, there would be a good chance that too much damage would have already been done.
My Uber had dropped me off at the house. Though I’d only been gone for three days, the entire aura of our home seemed different… darker. As much as I felt the overwhelming need to rush through the front door to check on her, a part of me was terrified at what I might find. We didn’t have much time to figure this out before Mom brought the kids back home. I almost wanted to call her and tell her not to even bring them. But then I would have to explain why and what was going on. These were questions I wasn’t quite prepared to answer.
The smooth but soul-crushing sound of heartache rang through the house. Vicky was playing one of her mother’s old Tammy Wynette albums. Our home was clean for the most part; I’d expected blood and discarded body parts to be strewn about the apartment. My wife’s humming grew louder along with my heartbeat as she turned the corner. She was… beautiful! I was so relieved to come home to the woman I married that I instantly picked her up and twirled her around. We kissed several times before setting her back down again.
I held her tight in my arms, chuckling with the joy of relief. Then I looked in the living room mirror…
H-Her face separated from my shoulder, leaving strings of puss and blood in its wake. My wife’s forehead was slick with infection, sinew and muscle tissue gleamed against the living room light. I could see every bit of visceral damage done to my wife’s face. Shoving her away, I looked to my shoulder, and… there was nothing. Where the mirror showed a disgusting stain of fluids was crisp, cotton to my naked eye.
I’ve moved most of the mirrors covering the ones too heavy for travel. Sheets adorn our windows, keeping our children from their normal sunlit play. I play with them outside a lot and it doesn’t seem to be a problem, as long as they don’t catch her reflection in the car windows.
I have no idea if I’m losing it or if there really is something fundamentally wrong with her. She is begging me to help with her back, to free her from a life of pain and torment.
I wonder if this has ever happened to anyone else. After all, YouTube and the internet can teach someone to do just about anything.
I’m scared that if I don’t agree to this, she’s ready to do this herself before most of her spine is affected.
What should I do?"	9.19	16.0	N.M. Brown	07/17/2020
The Blood Keeper	"I live in a small, but lively town in Massachusetts. Its local legends have fueled my love affair with the paranormal. It’s a subject that fascinates me to this day. Coupled with insomnia, this passion led me to spend many a late night at the town cemetery on the off-chance I might see a ghostly apparition while walking through to pass the time. Unfortunately, most of these outings were unfruitful; void of all activity, supernatural or otherwise. I gave up on my dream of stealing a glimpse at what comes after, but kept visiting the graves anyway; a place where I could collect my thoughts when sleep eluded me. One night, however, something changed.
It was a dark spring evening. I was bored, couldn’t sleep, and felt the need to do something outdoors in the cool, night air. As it so often did, the local graveyard called out to me, begging me to frolic within its gates. I obliged, unable to fight the alluring promise of its peaceful nature. It was the only place I could truly relax.
After a couple of hours there, I decided on one last stroll along the headstones in an attempt to become tired before heading home. Upon starting my walk, I noticed something. There was a light on in the grounds keeper’s shack. It wasn’t like him to be working so late. This wasn’t completely out of the ordinary, however, until you factored in the large, gaping hole nearby, big enough for several caskets. It was a miracle I hadn’t fallen in earlier in the night.
Curious as to what the old man was up to, I crept over to the shack, making my way to the busted window on its side. What I saw was strange.
Inside were nine men wearing tattered, blue shrouds, partaking in a makeshift feast. The main course was an oily, red stew with a horrific smell that permeated the shack’s walls and ventured up my nasal passages, tempting me to gag. The men winced when putting it to their lips, save for three; a tall man at the end of the table and the two sat beside him. When the feast was over, this tall figure stood up and addressed the room.
“Hello, newcomers. I hope dinner has been to your liking.”
He spoke with a firm voice. It resonated throughout the shack and beckoned even me to listen.
“Now that our bellies are full, Elijah will explain the rules of your impending trial.”
I listened closely. It seemed the men in the shack were part of a collective known as the Bloodlights. The trial the tall man spoke of was something akin to a medieval, gladiator sport used to initiate new members.
I listened on as Elijah divulged the game’s inner workings, fearful but curious.
Two teams were to disperse to opposite sides of the cemetery, each consisting of four members; three Blood Runners and one Blood Baron. The initiates would be the runners, and the tall man’s henchmen would act as Barons. There was one more participant to be discussed. The tall man himself. He was the Blood Keeper. Though not on either team, he was the most crucial facet of the game. He kept and guarded what was referred to as the Blood. I gathered that this referred to the red amulet hanging from the Keeper’s neck, as he firmly clasped it every time the word blood was uttered. The job of the Runners was to retrieve the Blood from the Keeper. The Barons acted as counsel, overseeing each team and helping where needed.
After Elijah finished his lecture, the Blood Keeper took over.
“With every wound, there is blood. With every drop of blood, there is solace. Without death, there can be no light.”
The Keeper opened a large cupboard in the corner of the shack, revealing a woman, bound and gagged, futilely attempting to cry out for help. My heart sank. This was not your normal, run-of-the-mill cult ritual. I had to find help, but what if they heard me? Unable to nail down my next course of action, I was immobile, frozen in fear.
The Blood Keeper continued.
“The light of blood can only be seen in death.”
Pulling a large, red dagger out from his cloak, he grabbed the woman and plunged it into her gut. I watched in horror as the life left her eyes. She began to shriek, but was soon cut off by a cut to the chest, followed by a final blow to her neck. I was mortified.
After throwing his kill to the floor, the Keeper pulled out three vials, filling each of them with the blood that dripped from his blade. This was the Blood the Runners were after, not the amulet.
“This is all the Blood I have to offer. That gives, at most, three of you the opportunity to become Bloodlights. And remember, you are being watched. Those who feel to collect must be disposed of. The same goes for any outsider you encounter. Corpses are to be thrown in the pit.”
Dear God. I was truly in danger. That’s what the nearby hole was for. The perfect hiding spot for a mass grave.
“You must stop at nothing to obtain one of these vials. All others will be sacrificed. Your thirst for blood must be as strong as your will to live.”
The men exited the shack to begin the trial. I scurried, silently to the wooded part of the graveyard and hid behind a large tree, not wanting to end up like that poor woman. I just needed an opening to escape without being noticed.
Glancing out at the cemetery, I saw a Runner knelt before a grave, eyes closed. I assumed this was a requirement before the game commenced. A perfect chance for me to make a run for it.
“Let the trial begin!”
The Blood Keeper’s voice echoed through the trees before I could take even a single step towards safety. My survival still hung in the balance.
Using a moonlit pool of water by my feet as a reflective surface, I watched as Elijah and three Runners strategized just ten yards from my position. My heart was pounding so hard, I was worried they would hear it. Between the beating in my chest and the conspiring whispers that filled the forest, my ears were consumed with an unsettling symphony of torture. Just when I couldn’t bear another moment, silence cut through the brisk, night air like the Keeper’s dagger piercing that woman’s skin. A chill then burrowed into my spine.
The puddle’s reflection bore no cloaked figures. Peering out from behind the tree confirmed that they were gone; or at least, nowhere to be seen. This was my chance.
Looking off into the distance, I saw a tomb by the main road; maybe a hundred yards away. It would provide the perfect cover to escape toward civilization, but there was no way I could waltz over there without being seen. The woods wrapped around the cemetery, so running from tree to tree would strengthen my odds of survival.
I took a deep breath and braced myself. Without so much as a second thought, I dashed to the next tree on the path to safety and took cover. I then gathered my wits and surveyed my surroundings. No cloaks in sight. I sprinted to the next tree and took another look out at the world. The coast was still clear. As I was about to take off in the direction of my next hiding spot, panic set in as my feet inexplicably left solid ground. My blood ran cold as I was lifted into the air by some unseen force.
The next thing I knew, my body was hoisted up and placed atop a tree branch. There, I was greeted by the unnerving sight of my captor, a Blood Runner. I didn’t scream or try to get away. It would be of no use. I sat there in terror and exhaled what I thought would be my last breath. Instead of gutting me, the man spoke.
“What’s your name?”
I was too shocked to respond.
“Come on now, who are you?”
He spoke clearer this time, revealing a slight English accent.
“Look, I noticed you at the window over there, eavesdropping. If I wanted you dead, I could have killed you then. I want you to help me.”
“Help… you?” I asked.
“Yes. I’m going to use you to my advantage. I take it you know what we’re doing here, and you know the rules of the game?”
I nodded slowly, still shook.
“Good. With you, I may be able to turn the tables and get the upper hand.”
I was frightened, but I calmed down enough to focus on the Runner’s plan.
“See that tomb over there? That’s where the Blood Keeper is.”
My stomach turned. To think, this guy may have just saved my life.
“I need you to go over to the tomb and open the door, slowly. The Blood Keeper will surely take a swing at you. Just as he’s about to end your life, I’ll swoop in and end his.”
“But why,” I asked, “That’s not part of the game.”
“Right you are. You need not concern yourself with the why. Just know that if you don’t do as I say, I will kill you myself. Now get going.”
The man gave me his cloak for protection and pushed me out of the tree. I didn’t want to risk facing the Blood Keeper, but I didn’t want to perish at the Runner’s hands either. My fear of dying kept me from deviating.
I again ran from tree to tree, eventually making it to my destination, the stench of bloodshed wafting through the air as Runners fought for control of the field. With my back pressed to the cold, aged stone, the pull to escape grew. The main road was within reach, but the thought quickly subsided. I was far too worried the Englishman would catch up with me and take his price. He was able to climb a tree and lift my weight into it without a sound; it was clear he possessed the agility and stealth needed to take me by surprise during a haphazard run for the hills. I sighed in defeat, knowing that, one way or another, I would probably die that night.
Mustering up every bit of courage I had left, I crept around the tomb and faced its door. My shaking hands reached for the rusted handle and pulled it towards me. Before its hinges could even creak at the motion, the door burst open, pushed from within. The force knocked me over, my head connecting with the unforgiving ground. The moments that came after remain fuzzy.
The Blood Keeper towered over me, half of his body in shadow, the other soaked in moonlight. A vision of death there to steal the blood from my racing heart. My eyes grew weary and shut for an instant before opening to see another figure. I couldn’t make out who was who in my dazed state, but one attacked the other, completely overpowering them. The prey in this scuffle fell to his knees before landing face-first into the cold, cemetery soil. The familiar sound of metal colliding with flesh rang through the air as the victor saw to it that the job was done. I prayed it was the Blood Keeper being torn apart; otherwise, I was a goner. My eyes shut again before unconsciousness finally took hold.
* * * * * *
“Hey, are you alright?”
I heard an old man’s voice as I came to.
“Are you okay?”
I opened my eyes to see who it was. The groundskeeper stood over me, holding a lantern to my face.
“What!? How? Where are they?”
“Where’s who?” he asked.
“You don’t understand. I should be dead.”
The groundskeeper stared at me, confused, but then smiled.
“Come on. You’ll catch cold out here.”
The groundskeeper, who I now know to be Pete, invited me into his shack. He prepared some food and tossed me a blanket to keep warm. Thankful and in need of an ear to fill, I told him everything, despite how I knew it would sound. I didn’t describe the men by their given titles, but Pete seemed to know who I was talking about.
“Sounds like you had a run-in with the Blood Keeper.”
“That’s him! How did you know?”
“His spirit has been visiting these grounds for… over a hundred years now, I suppose.”
His spirit? Incredible. It was all a haunting. Something I always thought I wanted to experience, firsthand.
Pete and I talked for a long while. He knew all about the Bloodlights and their dastardly deeds. Apparently, they were a sadistic cult that formed in the 1800s, terrorizing the local community. Each Bloodlight initiation brought with it more disappearances. They used the cemetery as a space for their trails, burying casualties and sacrifices at the end of every night. After all, who would look for the bodies in a graveyard?
Over fifty souls fell victim to the Bloodlights before their sinister games were brought to a halt. During their last outing, an Englishman infiltrated their ranks and killed the Blood Keeper, avenging the death of his wife who had been murdered during one of their trials. Soon after, his disciples came forward, claiming to have been controlled by the Keeper’s amulet, alleging that it had supernatural powers. No such amulet was ever recovered.
After Pete explained everything, I sat in awe, dumbstruck by the whole ordeal. Had I relived that fateful night? Or did I time travel and help that man fulfill his goal? I may never know what happened that day, but one thing is certain. I will never visit another cemetery for as long as I live, just in case the ghost of the Blood Keeper is still out there, making his rounds."	9.27	15.0	Christopher Maxim	07/15/2020
I Saw My Professor Die	"The day I accidentally witnessed my physics teacher die horribly, I didn’t know what to do. I went to my classes in a daze, sat there stunned for hours, and wondered if people would think I had something to do with it if I reported it. After much anguish, I finally resolved to call the police when I got home, but I never got the chance. On my walk past his house, Professor Randall was sitting on his front porch as if nothing had happened.
He noticed me staring, and he waved.
On pure reflex, I waved back.
Then, absolutely horrified, I walked on past.
I didn’t go home. Instead, I went to my friend Dustin’s house. He lived one block away from the Professor, and he was in the same physics class. There was a chance he would understand. If he didn’t, he could at least help me snoop.
Dustin was skeptical. “You saw him die?”
“Yeah.” I acted it out in his living room. “I missed class and his office hours yesterday, so he told me to drop my homework off at his mailbox in the morning. When I went by, his front door was drifting in the wind, so I checked it out. I heard something in the basement, and when I looked down the stairs, I saw him fall in a vat of acid.”
“A vat of acid? Why would our physics professor have a vat of acid in his basement?”
I suddenly felt rather stupid. “Good question. I ran out of there and didn’t get a chance to look around much.”
“Well, then let’s see what we can find out.”
That was the answer I’d been hoping for. Together, we walked toward the Professor’s house, approaching through back yards and from behind fences. When we reached his place, we crept along the side, only to find that his basement windows had been blocked by cardboard on the inside. We couldn’t see anything, but we could certainly smell something.
I winced at the acrid nostril-burning odor. “That must be the acid.”
He wasn’t so sure. “Is that what acid smells like? I have no idea.”
We heard a car pull out of the driveway up ahead. After a tense minute, we walked around to the front of the house to find him gone. I was intent on leaving, but Dustin had other ideas. He slid open a window, then crawled inside.
I followed, if only because I needed to know that I wasn’t crazy.
“Over there,” I whispered, and we crept toward the basement door.
Dustin went to open it, then flinched. “It’s hot!” Holding his sleeve over his hand, he carefully turned the knob. When the basement door opened, we were greeted with a blast of acrid humid heat. We both covered our mouths and noses, then took a few steps down.
I saw it. “There!” But it wasn’t a vat of acid. It was a wide plant of some sort, curled and closed, like a Venus fly trap in waiting. It looked big enough to hold a person. “He must have been… in this…”
Daring to briefly touch it with a covered hand, Dustin countered, “Are you sure he wasn’t just leaning over it?”
I shuddered at the memory. “I saw his face melting off his skull.”
He froze. “Oh.”
That was when we heard the car pull back into the driveway outside.
We looked around in a panic, but there was nowhere to hide except behind the couch-sized plant itself. We hunkered down and waited, breathless, as we heard his footfalls descend into the basement. Dustin and I exchanged worried glances—but we didn’t have to wait long. The Professor pulled a leaf at the base of the plant, and it opened up next to us, releasing more foul-smelling hot air.
Then, he dove right in, face first, clothes and all.
The two of us leapt up in a panic. While I quickly took off my jacket to get smoking spots of splashed acid away from my body, Dustin looked into the open plant.
He grabbed my arm forcefully. “Look.”
We watched as Professor Randall’s flesh melted away, skin first, followed by organs, leaving a skeleton. That, too, dissolved over the course of several seconds. Once there was nothing but green liquid darkened brown by gore, the contents sluiced away, as if someone had opened a drain.
We ran.
We ran.
Back at Dustin’s house, we screamed at each other for a good hour, just trying to understand what we’d seen. After that, we went home, vowing never to speak of it to anyone. Neither of us wanted the police thinking we had anything to do with whatever the hell we’d just witnessed. For my part, I remained awake in bed that night, reliving the traumatic sight over and over. I didn’t sleep at all.
Imagine our surprise when Professor Randall was teaching physics class the next day—grey slicked-back hair, hawk nose, and single mole, the same man we saw every day. If anything, he seemed more energetic than usual, perhaps even animated.
Dustin and I sat stock still the entire class, just staring.
When it was over, we both followed him at a distance. He walked the entire way home—his car was in his driveway when we arrived. He was not a young man by any means. How had he gotten to campus?
We didn’t dare get any closer. However, the next day, Dustin decided to stay and watch his house to try to see if our Professor was traveling another way.
When Professor Randall arrived to teach class, I texted him, Dude, you missed him. He’s here.
Dustin wrote back, WTF? He never left. No chance.
Confused, I waited until class was over, and then followed the Professor again. This time, he didn’t walk home. Instead, he slipped into a disused janitor’s closet at the far end of the building. I tried the door after a couple minutes, and found it locked.
He’s here, Dustin texted.
What the hell was going on? He straight up walked into a closet here. I’ve been right outside the entire time. There’s no way out. Also, he’s only been in there five minutes.
I have a theory. Hold on. I’ll be there soon.
I waited, nervous, until Dustin arrived.
He pulled a crowbar out of his backpack. “I have a feeling we’re going to find another plant in there.”
When we managed to force our way in, he was right. Behind several shelves, we found another couch-sized fly trap plant. I backed away from it, but he approached it.
“You know what I think this is?” He pulled the leaf at the bottom, and it opened up to reveal an organic leafy bed glistening with unknown depths of acid. “I think it’s a transporter, somehow.”
“The hell? Like from Star Trek?” I moved one step closer. “How, though?”
“Well, he’s not dying when he jumps in, clearly,” Dustin thought aloud. “And he’s getting places faster than should be possible. He’s been so excited since that week he had off last month. Do you think he found something on his trip? This impossible plant? I bet he hasn’t even told anyone yet.”
I wasn’t buying it. “It melts you. How could it be a transporter?”
“I dunno. That’s what the transporter does, in the shows. It breaks you down into tiny pieces, then reconstructs you at the other end.” He took a deep breath. “Acid still breaks you down, right? If that even is acid. It’s a transporter, just not the way we expected.”
Still intending on saying something skeptical, I stepped forward—but, probably thinking I was going to pull him away, that prompted him to jump.
He leapt in sideways, not face first like the Professor had.
He splashed in shoes first, and sank in up to his waist.
I stared.
He turned and looked at me.
Then, he began to scream with absolute horror.
I reached out as he began to sink, and I managed to grab his hand. I braced my feet against the base of the plant, but a vine-like tongue wrapped around his torso and dragged him down. Once his jeans had melted away, the green acid turned brown, and I knew his legs were dissolving. I tried as hard as I could, but his terrified screaming was like a drill in my brain, and my heart hammered so hard in my chest that I thought I would pass out and get dragged in, too.
He didn’t die fast enough.
I let go, but he was still alive when he sank fully in. I watched his face dissolve, leaving just a screaming skull with melting eyes—until his lungs filled, and the sound became a bubbling moan of agony. Mercifully, finally, he sank away completely, just before the liquid sluiced away like it had at the Professor’s house.
Half-crying from the horror, half-laughing from the shock, I wandered out of that janitor’s closet in a state of pure wide-eyed emptiness. The only thing I could do now was hope that Dustin had been right.
I drifted away from campus, then down the suburban streets toward his house.
I knocked.
After a few moments, I heard footsteps. The door opened, and—Dustin answered. “Oh, hey buddy.”
Confused and full of adrenaline, I asked, “Did it work?”
“Yeah. I teleported!” He tugged on his shirt. “Clothes and all. Ended up in the Professor’s basement and managed to sneak out. My cell phone even survived the trip somehow.”
Barely able to control myself, I demanded, “Then why the hell didn’t you text me?!”
“Text you?”
I grabbed his shirt with two fists. “I thought you were dead! You were screaming, and dying, and I saw you dissolve—”
He shook his head and laughed. “Screaming? What are you talking about? I jumped in and my feet basically hit the ground instantly. Never even touched acid. Teleportation’s easy! Can’t wait until the Professor goes public with his discovery. I gotta get me one of those plants. Maybe even two!”
Oh, God. So that was how it was.
I took a moment to process what had really happened.
I let go of his shirt then, and patted the rumples down. “Cool. Yeah. Sorry I freaked out there.” I turned and started heading away, my blood ice cold.
He asked, “See you in class tomorrow?”
“Yeah,” I called back without looking, too shaken to face that stranger again. “See you in class… Dustin.”"	9.09	11.0	Matt Dymerski	07/12/2020
911 Won’t Answer Any Calls Tonight	"“Is it true? Did every cop in the precinct call in sick tonight?” I asked my friend who lives across the street from the police station.
“Yeah, Wayne.” I heard him answer as I could also hear him racking his shotgun. “Can’t say I blame them, considering things lately. The mayor is scared and telling them to stand back and let the crowds do what they want. They’ve been getting ambushed and attacked on the job. If they do their job, the mayor threatened to have them fired or jailed. Now I see some angry folks spilling out of the bar and walking down the street like the town is their playground. Heads up, they’re headed towards your neighborhood. Be ready. Now I’ve got to go.”
I told my wife to get our two-year-old son and go to the interior of the house, away from any doors or windows. I turned off the lights and checked that everything was locked. Then I went to my safe, holstered a sidearm, and checked my shotgun. Dang. I should have gotten something better than my grandpa’s old hunting gun. A 12 gauge is effective but limited against an angry crowd.
I briefly considered packing up the family and leaving but that would be worse. Angry crowds blocked the highway and drivers were being assaulted in their vehicles. They were sitting ducks. If they defended themselves, the mayor would have them arrested. It was like this everywhere. There was nowhere to go and we were on our own.
I looked out the window and saw nothing but eerie fog and the blackened tree line on the edge of the property. We lived just outside of town where houses were spread out and we were off a dead-end road.
Only one way in or out.
Suddenly I heard the angry mob yelling from down the road. Standing guard at an open window, I raised my gun when I saw lots of motion by the tree line. I relaxed when I saw several coyotes yipping and running away from the mob. Then I heard growling and barking, followed by several terrified yipping and howling coyotes running and limping away in all directions. Then I looked up at the tree line and saw two massive eyes glowing back at me. It was something on four legs but was taller than any creature native to this area.
Baxter?
It had been a rough few months. I had only recently gone back to work after being laid off. We had struggled to get by, and on top of it, we had lost both our pets. The first was our cat that was killed by coyotes. Our dog Baxter took it really hard. He was an Ovcharka, a massive, fluffy Russian dog that looked more like a bear. He had always been tame and mild-mannered. He loved that cat more than anything, and when it died he became depressed. He just spent all his time on the back porch staring off into the woods. Then, one day last week, he saw a coyote running by the edge of the woods. He just stood up, walked after it into the tree line and never came back. There had been an issue with feral dogs around here. With the economic situation, lots of folks abandoned them off the highway near us. I figured he may have joined up with them.
Then there was work. A drunk, lazy co-worker named Bo had fallen off the wagon and started showing up drunk. He was always angry and rude, but now even more so. He’d snap at everyone and he reeked of the same cheap whiskey he always drank. Of course, it fell on me earlier today to have to go and fire him. He turned down every effort we’d made at offering him counseling and we had no choice. He threatened me and stormed out of the facility. Just one more thing to put on my list of worries right now.
I heard a commotion from the dead-end road leading up to our driveway and I ran up to the front of the house to look. There was an angry crowd holding bats and tire irons making their way up the drive. The punk at the front of them had a mask tied around his face and looked like a college kid living in his mom’s basement. That didn’t mean he wasn’t dangerous though.
I cracked the window and loudly racked the shotgun. The punk’s eyes got big and the crowd turned and ran. Somehow, I still felt unsettled. This didn’t seem like the crowd my friend had described over the phone. These were the amateurs.
I heard a sound like something being slashed from the back of the house. I remembered I left the back window cracked open that I had been looking out of. Someone was cutting through the mesh. I shut and locked the front window and ran to the back.
I saw a massive hand wielding a kitchen knife cutting through the window mesh. I could smell cheap whiskey in the air. It was Bo.
Bo yelled. “This is the place, boys! The one I told you about at the bar. Wayne buys that pretty little wife of his lots of nice jewelry. I’ll bet there’s plenty of good stuff in here. When you find my old boss Wayne, he’s mine.”
There were lots of them. More than I could handle on my own.
I didn’t want to tip off anyone with a gunshot so I grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed Bo’s hand. He yelled and pulled away. Then I heard glass from the back door breaking as someone was forcing their way in from the back porch. I ran back there and raised my shotgun at the intruder. I couldn’t shoot because my wife and son were in the room behind him. He lifted up an empty beer bottle as a weapon. I charged at him and kicked him hard right in the gut. He flew out the door and flipped over the railing. I heard him screaming in pain when he hit the ground. I saw three more men outside as I lifted my shotgun.
From behind me, Bo’s massive forearm put me in a chokehold. He must have climbed through the window. I struggled to breathe as I kicked and elbowed him to no avail.
He let out a sickening laugh. “Who’s fired now, Wayne? Where is your little family at?”
When you’re in a situation like this, apparently all notions of civilized society are melted away and you find yourself a primitive rage. I pulled out my handgun and shot him in the foot. He screamed and I turned around and pistol-whipped him upside the head. I pointed my gun and fired as he stumbled outside and I missed. He and four other guys were out there.
I yelled at the top of my lungs. “Baxter!”
Bo and his cohorts looked at me with confusion until Baxter and four other dogs behind him came charging out of the forest. Baxter looked completely different from the dog I once knew. He still looked like a fearsome mix of canine and grizzly but now he was baring his teeth and growling with his mouth dripping coyote blood. He’d gone feral.
Bo and his buddies screamed as Baxter and his pack hit them like a wall. They fell to the ground and struggled and screamed in terror as the dogs bit and snarled at them. One by one, Bo and the other drunks fought away and stumbled into the woods.
Baxter stood in front of his pack and stared at me. I was strangely proud of him. He was an Alpha. This was his pack, this neighborhood was his territory and he was defending it.
From the other side of the trees, I heard a neighbor lady screaming as the other mob approached her house.
I looked at Baxter. “Sic ‘em, boy!”
Baxter barked at me and then tore off into the trees, his pack following closely behind."	9.21	19.0	Kyle Dover	07/05/2020
Uncle Scratch	"“Daddy, why is mommy so cold?”
She was dead. Maurice knew that much, but why was she so cold? His father, a stout man named Gregory, was silent. Everyone knows we die. Not even children deny it. Yet knowing a fact and believing it are different. Maurice knew his mother lay dead in her casket. Gregory explained the custom of a wake to him in advance. Yet while Maurice was old enough to acknowledge death, he was too young to believe his mother could die. They did not speak on the drive home. As they passed between houses, Maurice thought the vacant windows resembled his mother’s empty eyes. Maurice hardly breathed, and his father dared not look at him. They moved not long after. That was when Maurice began seeing monsters.
Gregory made his living as an event coordinator. He originally focused on local events, mainly weddings. After his wife’s death, he began coordinating large-scale festivals and trade shows. This required him to travel across the country. Often he would rent a new house, but never spent enough time there to settle down. As a result, Maurice never formed strong attachments or friendships. However, he saw plenty of monsters. Each new home contained some dark presence. Be it a ghoulish face in the bedroom window, a cold spot in the basement, or creaking in the attic. Gregory insisted the claws in the moonlight were only gnarled trees. He told Maurice he saw the silhouettes of cobwebs on the staircase, not ghosts. Their humid cellar contained insects, not demons. That did not explain the dank smell in the kitchen of their next home. Maurice thought it was a vampire. He warned his father that it must sleep under the sink, for lack of a coffin. It bode its time until night, whispered Maurice, when it slunk out to drink their blood.
Their latest home was different though. Even when he saw its photograph, Maurice felt uneasy. The emotion almost did not exist, save for his vaguest contemplation. The fear only appeared when he arrived in person. It was sunset. Gregory stood outside the car. He admired the house from the curb before rushing indoors. Maurice studied every inch. He gazed from the gables to the garden. His eyes found an upstairs window, soon to be his bedroom. There he saw Uncle Scratch, dimly lit from below as the sun melted behind the clouds. His form was visible in the dying light, yet his features remained hidden. Maurice’s expression bore no surprise. The boy was experienced at recognizing monsters. They were all worrisome, yet Maurice knew Uncle Scratch would be the worst. Most monsters were eager to reveal their presence. Their hideous faces quickly appeared in his nightmares. That day, Maurice only saw Uncle Scratch’s moss-colored eyes. Then he left the windowpane and submerged into darkness. In other ways, Uncle Scratch was like any monster. He appeared at night and resided within the bedroom closet. Maurice took care to keep it spotless. Monsters are less inclined to haunt clean spaces. During the first night, Uncle Scratch’s stare confronted him. His mossy eyes betrayed an insatiable hunger. Maurice knew that Uncle Scratch did not care for flesh. He wanted something more, and Maurice feared it was worse.
Maurice owned a night-light. It was a gift from his mother, and it comforted him in other homes. He tried to use it here, but it was disturbing to have a light illuminating Uncle Scratch. Maurice cringed at the sight of the slimy rats. Uncle Scratch’s gloved hands stroked them as they writhed. His touch was never gentle. They scurried over his suit, clashing with his unwrinkled tie and spotless white gloves. This cleanliness amplified the rats’ repulsiveness. Once, a rat attempted to issue a warning. He told Maurice not to accept Uncle Scratch’s treats. Before it finished, Uncle Scratch pulled the rat away. He dropped it into his pocket by its tail. Maurice heard it squeal as it disappeared. Then Uncle Scratch spoke to him. His whisper was coaxing, almost friendly. He offered Maurice a treat, but he did not accept. Uncle Scratch left, promising to bring Maurice another surprise tomorrow. Maurice shuddered, for monsters never spoke. They waited until Maurice fell asleep before venturing forward. Waking chased them away. Uncle Scratch could not be frightened so easily, every night Maurice heard him beckon. Uncle Scratch proved strenuous for Gregory as well. “Go to bed!” he ordered, as he listened to the radio.
“But Daddy, Uncle Scratch will be up there,” Maurice sobbed. “He’ll show me some candy or a toy; he’ll try to get me! Please, Daddy. It’s getting harder to resist him every night. He just won’t ever give up.” “Your obsession with monsters is tiresome,” sighed his father. “It’s those pulp magazines you read. If they hadn’t belonged to your mother, I’d have burned the lot to ashes.”
Maurice listened for a moment, until the ball game on the radio returned. Gregory turned away to enjoy it. Maurice hated sports; he never understood why his father fussed over them. Sighing, Maurice went upstairs for bed. As he departed, Gregory called after him. “Remember to brush your teeth!” After three steps, Maurice stopped. He studied the stairs. He wondered about the creaking. In an earlier house, Lady Swoon-Moon made similar sounds. He remembered her long teeth. She painted them like candy canes with the blood of children. To Maurice, each creak was the sound of munching. He visualized her crouched over the bones of innocent victims. Maurice quaked in fear. He ran up the stairs and saw the bathroom door. It was a foot from his bedroom. Maurice needed to relieve himself. The bathroom seemed miles away. He stepped forward, and heard a creak. His bedroom door was open, and a rat scurried out. “Don’t listen to him Maurice,” it squeaked. “He told me there’d be a dollhouse…” The rat never finished. The door opened wider and Uncle Scratch’s hand shot forward. He clutched the rat and dragged it into the bedroom. It screamed in the voice of a young girl. The door shut, and Uncle Scratch’s eye materialized in the keyhole. It stared at Maurice lustfully. The boy bolted into the bathroom and slammed the door. He quivered on the toilet seat for hours. Eventually, his eyes shut and he fell asleep. Meanwhile, his closet door opened and Uncle Scratch crept out. Through the bathroom keyhole, he studied Maurice. His expression sparkled with anticipation. “Soon,” he whispered as his tongue massaged his lips.
Gregory had fallen asleep listening to his radio. He awoke suddenly, and his lips parted in fear. He studied his radio vacantly. A re-run of Lights Out was playing. He switched it off, while his free hand fumbled into his pocket for matches. Quivering, he lit his pipe. “Good Lord,” he whispered to himself. “What a nightmare.” His face sunk as he remembered fragments of his dream: gloved hands, rats, and mossy eyes. Someone he knew was screaming in that dream, someone young. “I better check on Maurice,” he whimpered to himself. He trod up the stairs, through the hallway, and into Maurice’s room.
“My God!” he exclaimed upon entering. He stood staring, his hand frozen on the doorknob. Toys littered the floor, but Maurice’s bed was empty. His face paled. Then he heard snoring from outside. The bathroom light was on, and he sighed with relief. He smiled as he opened the bathroom door and saw him sleeping. “That’s my boy,” he sighed. His arms sagged with the child’s weight as he lifted him. Maurice’s eyes fluttered while his father carried him to his bedroom. They half-opened as the blanket swished over him, before closing once more.
Hours later, Maurice awoke. He silently cursed his foolishness and wondered how he got into bed. In the darkness, a noise sounded. Yet it was not rats scurrying or children moaning. It was a human voice. Maurice was still, corpse-like. The noise broke the silence like ice cracking. Maurice drew a silent breath and listened closer. There was silence, then a whine. A long sob emerged before the silence returned. Maurice turned his head. The moon outside had disappeared, and the room was black. Another murmur; there was no mistake. Someone was weeping. Was this Uncle Scratch? Maurice had never heard a monster cry, not even as a trick. A wet sound followed, like a bucket collecting rain. Maurice visualized tears streaming down a woman’s face. Another sob; it was nearer now. The dripping continued, accentuated by occasional moans. The sound was feminine. Maurice remembered his mother, and his eyes watered. He debated turning on his lamp, Uncle Scratch would have offered a treat by now. He reached toward the switch, but stopped. There was a fumbling, then a sob near Maurice’s ear. In fear, he drew back his hand and the noise ceased. Maurice did not lie down. He feared the presence would hear his mattress. In the dark, something slithered. Maurice sensed the presence under his bed. Sweat tickled his chin, but he was too frightened to wipe it away. The voice returned. It wept under the bed in a constant stream. Did it want his attention? Maurice ventured a question. “Why are you crying?” he asked.
The sound ceased, and Maurice heard a soft creaking as something crawled out from under the bed. There was silence, until a huddled mass formed over the window. “Maurice?” the mass whimpered. “Is that you?” Maurice turned pale, it sounded like his mother. Suddenly, a blue light jarred the mass into a straight stance. Maurice saw that it was indeed his mother. The light emanated from wires fastened to her skull. She floated before him like a specter.
Maurice titled his head, and noticed Uncle Scratch illuminated in the corner. His mossy eyes stared at his mother viciously. After several jolts, she floated limply in the air. Uncle Scratch lifted a hammer and an ice pick for Maurice to see. Casually, he strode nearer while Maurice watched helplessly. Floundering electric sparks from the wires occasionally tore through the darkness. In these moments, Maurice watched Uncle Scratch set the hammer down on his bedside table. Uncle Scratch pulled back his mother’s left eyelid. Slowly, he inserted the ice pick over the top of her eyeball. He carefully slid it deeper until it hit bone. He retrieved his hammer, and with two taps, he broke through the thin layer of skull. Maurice observed Uncle Scratch scraping behind it. Another two taps and more scraping behind the other eyeball and Uncle Scratch discarded his tools. He turned back to Maurice. “That’s what they did to her Maurice,” Uncle Scratch whispered. “They didn’t even bother to get a doctor to do it, just some staff member. Then they turned her loose, and she took a tumble down the stairs. We both know how that turned out, don’t we?”
The blue crackles died with the last of Uncle Scratch’s words. Maurice sat in thick darkness. He groped back in bed when he heard Uncle Scratch’s sinister voice in the blackness. “I can bring her back Maurice,” he said. “There will be a price, but nothing worthwhile is ever free. Just say yes.” The sound of rats scuttling behind the walls appeared. A mixture of fear and loneliness consumed Maurice. He wondered if Uncle Scratch could restore his mother. If so, what would remain of her? There was hardly a sound when Maurice whispered, “yes.”
In a flash, the room was empty. Maurice turned on his light and checked under the bed for his mother. He found her sprawled on the floor, gibbering mindlessly. Maurice crawled under the bed and lay with her. He wept and stroked her hair. They exchanged a horrified glance. She opened her mouth to speak, but only drool dripped out. Uncle Scratch had restored her flesh, but her mind was another matter. Moments later, Uncle Scratch’s hands snuck under the bed and pulled Maurice away. He locked him in the closet where he was alone with the rats. Uncle Scratch forbade him from calling to his mother, and then whispered, “It’s time to pay that price I mentioned.”
When a child disappears, questioning the parents is routine police work. The officers escorted Gregory from his home. From the car, he had one glance at the house. He looked upwards, and gazed at the window to Maurice’s bedroom. Before the police car departed, he saw a rat on the windowsill. For some reason, the sight disturbed him. It was just as well that his hearing was only average. Had he keen ears, he would have heard a voice squealing, “Daddy, help me. Please, Daddy.”"	9.38	13.0	Byron Dunbar	07/01/2020
There’s a Boy on My Bus That Smells of Death	"I have been doing this for many years.
Sure I have changed schools a couple of times, had to even move states to help with my wife’s elderly parents. But I have always viewed the kids on my bus as an extension of my family.
At the beginning of the school year, I prepare a welcome bag for them, something simple like a box of crayons and pencils for the kindergarteners and maybe a few notebooks for the upper grades.
They always enjoy every minute on my bus because I take the time to really truly get to know each one of them. I keep a record of their names, try to associate it with something like favorite food or song, and then memorize those details.
I know this probably seems like a lot of work when I am only getting paid a measly thirteen dollars an hour but it matters to me. Sometimes these kids are all alone and come from bad homes. It’s my job as part of the educational system to provide them with a safe place, even if it is for only an hour coming and going.
I think the kids  that  have the roughest time adjusting to school are the ones that come in late. With zero friends and no clue as to what’s happening, I try to help as much as I can. That was my intention when my boss gave me a new rider on March 30 this year. It was only a few blocks away from one of my other spots and according to the paperwork the kid was 6 years old and named Jack Calford. The file also said he had two siblings but neither of them was old enough to ride and that his mom’s name was Samantha and she had recently separated.
That told me already that this kid was probably going to have a tough time. I lost my dad at that age and it’s never been easy to connect to anyone. Had it not been for a few strong male figures in my life I probably wouldn’t have had anyone to consider a father.
So that next Monday morning I went the extra mile to get ready to meet Jack, I got two sets of crayons, pencils, some staplers and glue, and even a backpack with wheels.
I drove up to pick him up around 7:15, the time we had arranged with the mom and got my first look at his house. A few of the other kids were already making a few remarks because of the dirty unclean nature of their yard but I guessed that the mom probably didn’t have many choices when it came to finding housing. I’ve always been the kind to give people the benefit of the doubt.
I put my air brake on and the flashing lights told them I was outside, as I opened the door I smelled this strange distant odor. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it at first but it was very distinct. I think it reminded me of something I had found under my house once, like old mold.
But Jack never came out and I knew I couldn’t wait so I drove away.
The other kids jeered and I had to focus on settling them down the rest of the ride to the elementary as I thought about Jack and his current home conditions. I wanted to know for sure he was ok.
Jack didn’t show up to get on the afternoon route either and I asked my boss if I had gotten the wrong address.
“You know how it is. Parents never remember the first time they try to get their kids out to the bus on time.”
I couldn’t argue with that so the next day I decided to wait for a few extra minutes to make sure Jack could make it on the bus.
Again when I opened the door I smelled the repugnant odor and I felt my mouth starting to go dry. A few of the kids that I had already picked were starting to complain so I honked the horn.
Jack’s mom waved at the window and I smiled, glad to finally make some progress.
A few seconds later the door to their house opened and I saw Jack step out. I’ve seen a lot of kids come from bad situations, but the way this boy was dressed just hurt my heart.
It was clear that the mom couldn’t afford to get him clean pants, or even a shirt that was the right size. And as he got closer to the bus door I saw that his face was dirty and that odor I had detected earlier seemed to follow him as he got on the bus.
It took me a moment to refrain from being repulsed by the smell. I knew it wasn’t this child’s fault. So I smiled at him and offered him the backpack filled with goodies that I had been planning to give him the day before.
“Welcome aboard, Jack. You can call me Mister Charlie,” I said with a broad smile. The boy made no response and just took the bag and shuffled his feet toward the back of the school bus.
As he passed the other kids by, several of them started to make sarcastic and derogatory comments about his smell.
“Did you sleep in dog crap?” “Don’t you own a bath?” “Disgusting!” one little girl shouted. Jack didn’t bother to lash out. He just quietly got to the back of the bus and found an empty seat.
Unsurprisingly, nobody wanted to sit by him. Near the end of my route before we get to school, my bus gets typically packed and I nearly got into an argument with a high schooler about Jack.
“Mister Charles that kid smells like death!” the girl said holding her nose and trying not to gag.
“You either sit there or you walk to school!” I shouted at her. I hated to raise my voice. But the truth was during the entire bus ride, the other kids had complained. I knew that Jack was going to have problems as soon as he got into class.
After all the kids got off, I gave Jack a halfhearted smile and hoped that his teachers could find a way to get off that smell. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but I couldn’t imagine that his mother wanted him to go to school smelling like this. It just bothered me to no end, especially what that one girl had said. Jack smelled like he was covered in the odor of death. That wasn’t an exaggeration. It literally could only be described as the smell you could get if you had killed an animal and left it out in the hot sun for a week. And it made me so sad to imagine that poor kid having to be bullied and taunted all day because of that smell.
Not to my surprise that afternoon I found out Jack’s teacher had made him go home early because too many people had complained about his smell.
“I don’t think we can let this kid ride on the bus until his mom takes him to a doctor and figures out why he stinks so much,” my boss said. That just rubbed me the wrong way even more.
“It’s not their fault! Larry if you saw his house you would understand. These people are poor. They need some help,” I told him.
“Maybe so but that isn’t our problem. We have about fifty other kids to take care of on that route and we can’t be busy worrying about just one. The school will handle it from here,” my boss told me.
I told him I was fine with that, but it just sat wrong with me. I wanted to do something more than just stop and check to see if he could ride on the bus yet.
Maybe it wasn’t my place to do any of this, but my heart just went out to the kid. I went to Wal-Mart that afternoon and bought him everything I felt he needed and waited until I got off work to stop by his house.
I’ve always been told that after-hours we aren’t supposed to get sociable with our kids or their family, but I felt like this was an exception.
I got there about 4:15 and parked my car right in front of their driveway so there wasn’t any surprise about someone being there. I grabbed the backpack and walked up the door, doing my best to ignore the pungent smell that was all across the entire front yard.
Knocking on the door, I held the backpack behind my leg and got a better look at the toys that Jack was playing with scattered throughout the yard. There were dolls with their heads bitten off as though the boy had been chewing on them, mismatched LEGO sets that didn’t seem to have any particular pattern and action figures that reminded me of those messed up toys from the first Pixar film. All of it told me a troubling story about how Jack’s home life was going. Was that the reason for his smell?
His mother appeared at the door a moment later, her eyes filled with questions and surprise at seeing me.
“Who… who are you?” she asked.
“Ma’am. I don’t mean to bother but I work with the school. I’m your son’s school bus driver,” I told her as I briefly glanced inside their home. The mess that was covering the yard easily spread into the first living area. Was it so bad that they couldn’t clean up after themselves?
I didn’t want to judge so instead I showed her the gifts I brought for Jack. “I know that you want to give your child a good education. And all of us at the school are worried about him. This is my way of pitching in to help,” I said offering the backpack to her.
Her eyes welled up with tears and I wasn’t sure if she was going to have a breakdown or shout in my face. Sometimes it was impossible to be sure how a parent would react.
“I can’t accept this,” she finally said.
That was not the response I was expecting.
Before I knew how to even reply, she closed her door hastily and I was standing on the trash covered front step of her house alone.
I sighed, figuring that she must have her reasons and left the bag with the clothes at the side of her door. I didn’t mean to embarrass her but now my main concern was for the welfare of her child.
The next day Jack rode it seemed like his mom had overcome her apprehensive attitude because he was wearing the clothes I had bought. They fit him almost perfectly. Walking out to the bus, I saw he seemed happier than before, and I thought maybe this was the start of a new chapter for him.
That changed though when I opened the door to let him on the bus. That same foul smell covered him like a stench despite the new clothes and this time I found myself doing my best to avoid throwing up. It was that bad.
“Didn’t you take a shower?” a girl on the front seat asked.
Jack glared at her, seemingly embarrassed that his new clothes weren’t hiding his smell and then tossed his backpack down and ran back inside his house.
Some of the kids giggled and it took all my self-control not to yell for them to quiet. But I knew one thing for certain, Jack wouldn’t be going back to school until that smell was off his body permanently.
I don’t know why I felt obligated to reach out and help. Maybe because I was already so invested in him. Maybe because he reminded me of myself? But that afternoon I stopped by their house again with a new goal. It occurred to me that maybe his mother couldn’t afford clean water.
“I wanted to extend my house to you and your son,” I told her. I knew that being older she wouldn’t consider my intentions to be anything except friendly. But she still declined.
“I know you have been so kind to Jack. But you just need to stop. I don’t want anything bad to happen to you,” she said.
That thought made little sense to me as I couldn’t fathom how helping Jack out would harm me. And the way she acted bothered me. Was she… scared of her son?
It couldn’t be that. I felt like she was hiding something.
She had turned away help from me and from the school time and time again and I couldn’t grasp why that was. So I did something I have never had to do in my career and contacted CPS.
I think I was a little angry, maybe because I was just so worried about Jack. But I couldn’t think of any other way to help him.  I told the representative that I talked to the entire situation, and they thanked me for my diligence.
“You have done an amazing job, Mister Charles. We will handle it from here,” a woman told me.
That whole weekend my stomach churned and I worried about what would happen to Jack. They said they would get to his house as quickly as possible, but I wasn’t so sure it was going to be that easy.
Monday rolled around again, and I tried to resume normal life and put the worry out of my head. But it got stronger as I arrived at Jack’s house. Something was wrong. This time as he boarded the bus he looked angry and hostile. As though I had stabbed him in the heart.
The smell was also stronger than it had ever been. I literally had to hold my breath when he was near me. And I saw his mother standing in the doorstep glaring at me. It looked like her arm was covered in scratches. Had Jack attacked her because he was apprehensive about returning to school? It bothered me to no end. What if CPS had come but hadn’t found anything disturbing at all? It all felt like something had happened in that house and it wasn’t good.
I have made it a habit of mine to trust my gut, and this told me I needed to get inside that house and find out what was happening. I was sure I would likely lose my job over this, but I needed to know the truth about why Jack’s smell hadn’t gone away. Why CPS had not taken this kid away to a better home. I needed answers.
“Jack… is there something happening in your house that you are scared of?” I asked the boy.  I made sure he was the last one off that day. I knew the mother would open the door when she saw the school bus and it was going to be my only chance. He only nodded, not even bothering to explain. Not that he needed to. That told me that this mom was not the doting concerned parent I had given the benefit of the doubt to.
So I helped him off the bus and walked up to the door. The mom saw the look on my face and said, “You shouldn’t be here.”
“I need to see Jack’s room. He took something from me and I want it back.” (This was the lie I had prepared by slipping my Rolex into his pack from the previous day) The mom hesitated at first and then looked down at her son. As though checking with him that it was all right.
Jack gave a slight nod and then led me inside. The smell of death was even stronger here. I swear I saw a dead cat in the corner of the room. And it seemed like feces covered the floor. Jack guided me by the hand to a set of stairs that led to the basement.
“What’s down there?” I whispered. My blood was boiling, I was so angry with the mom for letting them live this way.
But Jack didn’t seem bothered. He just tugged my hand and encouraged me to come down with him and said, “My room.”
The basement was damp and moldy, a single dim bulb burning and hanging from a clothes string.
As we got to the bottom of the stairs, I saw something on the floor that looked like it was made of wood and had a cover on top of it. Getting closer I realized it was a tiny coffin, just large enough for Jack.
“Is there where you sleep?” I asked.
He nodded and I heard a muffled scream. There against the wall was a man about half my age, probably old enough to be Jack’s father. He was chained up and had half of his stomach pulled out, blood dripping on the concrete floor. His noises distracted Jack and he went over to his father and I watched in shock as he began to feed on the mangled organs dangling from his side.
I stumbled back toward the steps, my eyes not daring to look away as Jack kept eating and snarling. This was no way for a child to live. But then the glint in his eyes and the way his teeth gnashed against his dad’s flesh told me the truth. This was not a child at all. It was a ghoul.
I ran up the stairs. The mother was there, trembling and crying as she watched helplessly.
“Why don’t you tell the police?” I asked frantically.
She covered her mouth as she watched her son keep feeding. “Have you ever had children, Mister Charles?”
I ran from the house and toward the bus. I got back to work as quickly as possible and when I shut the bus down I held my breath for a few moments and counted to ten.
Then I realized I had left Jack’s backpack on the bus again. The stench of death was still coming from it. I dared to unzip it and look down to see decaying flesh stuffed in his pack like lunch meat. I pushed it away and gagged. I needed to tell someone.
As I got off the bus, I found myself staring at Jack. Somehow he had followed me from his house a few blocks away.
“You can’t tell anyone,” he warned.
Then he gestured toward the pack and encouraged me to unzip it again.
I looked in the goop of blood and bones and saw something shiny in there. I reached in and pulled it out. It was the badge of one of the CPS employees.
I looked up at Jack and he smiled and walked away.
Ever since that day, I have had Jack sit on the front row of the bus. And given him the best treatment. I’ve recommended his teachers do the same."	9.85	13.0	Kyle Harrison	06/28/2020
The Grey Man at Lost Lake	"When I was growing up my family had issues with trespassers. Not something you expect to deal with when your home sits along the shores of a secluded lake hidden deep within the woods. Even more surprising when your neighbors are all members of your own extended family. Yet trespassers were a regular occurrence for my family. Unsettling encounters with strangers in the woods a mere fact-of-life that my cousins and I became familiar with by the time that we were school age.
Most trespassers were easy to explain. Lost hikers were the most common due to our proximity to a national park and its meandering trails. They found their way on our property by accident and were always happy for the assistance and directions on how to get back to the park.
Then there were the people who trespassed intentionally. It was well known in the nearby towns that our family’s rather extensive property held within its borders some interesting bits of history and local lore. Researchers, writers, treasure hunters and similar folk all made appearances, each hoping to find some interesting artifact or inspiration to help them make a name for themselves. While these encounters could be annoying, sometimes even a bit tense when the offenders refused to leave, they too were rarely cause for concern.
That wasn’t the case with the trespasser my cousins and I called the Grey Man. Any meeting with him was always something to be afraid of.
The Grey Man got his name from the fact that while everyone had seen him at least once or twice, the descriptions of him were all vague and muddled. When our parents would question any of us kids after an encounter to figure out what we saw, the explanations always went the same way. The child had seen a man in the woods that made no sound, said no words, and didn’t resemble anything.
What was he wearing? We kids would never remember. What color hair did he have? We kids could never say. All we could ever describe was the dread he made us feel, and that his appearance was some hazy, murky, grey. Our parents began calling these stories encounters with the Grey Man and the title stuck.
I had more than a few run-ins with the Grey Man throughout my childhood, but the one I’m going to share here today was the most unsettling.
* * * * * *
When you live on a lake, swimming is a part of summer life. It’s not just because of the entertainment and the exercise, but because it’s a great way to keep cool during the long runs of humid 97-degree days (36 degrees Celsius for the rest of you). With all the time we spent swimming my cousins and I became as comfortable in the water as we were on land. We grew fearless of the depths below, ignorant of the dangers, always pushing to venture further and further from the shore whenever our parents weren’t looking.
The biggest rite of passage was swimming to the old fishing raft on the opposite side of the lake. One leg of the swim was just under a half-mile if you cut right across the lake at its center (one-mile round trip). By the time I was 14 I had made the swim to the fishing raft a handful of times, always in the company of others (usually my cousins). Unfortunately, that was the year I decided to try it on my own.
Over that summer I had been captivated by the coverage of the Olympics, specifically the Triathlon. I was a lanky kid who had grown tall but forgot to fill out, too easily pushed around to be competitive in sports like football, basketball, or soccer. But I could run for days and swim better than any of the kids in my class. For my adolescent brain, it felt like a calling, a sign that I was meant to train and become Olympic Triathlete.
Armed only with what I had learned from Bob Costas during the TV coverage I built out my plan to begin my training. From the Olympics, I had gathered that the swimming portion they did was about the same distance as going to the Fishing raft and back. So I decided I would start sneaking out of the house before dawn, make the swim when the waters were calm, and be back before anyone noticed I was missing. That first night I even slept in my suit I was so excited to start my journey towards greatness.
That morning I woke up early, 5:30 am just before sunrise, and crept down the stairs and out of the house without being noticed. I made my way down to the water’s edge and gazed out over the lake before me, a pane of mirrored glass smooth and unbroken. A light mist drifted around the shoreline like a halo, where the warm lake water mixed with the cool air from the forest floor. It created a pillow that muffled sound, painting the scene with peace and tranquility.
The world was calm as I broke the surface, slipped into the water, and began my swim.
The first half of my debut practice run across the lake was uneventful. I was familiar with the swim and was confident in my ability to make it. With about ¼ remaining until I reached the raft and my midway turn, the electric jolt of a cramp struck my hamstring. I lurched in the water, floundering briefly, then righted myself and fought through the pain as I did a quick analysis of my situation.
The raft was closer. Making it there would allow me to get out of the water to rest and stretch my hamstring. Heading to the raft, however, would leave me with a farther swim home once I was able to recover. If the cramp came back I could be in real trouble. Though If I turned now and tried to make it back without a break, I’d be putting myself at risk of drowning for sure.
I decided to take the shorter route to safety, shifted my body into a backstroke, and continued my way to the raft.
I reached the raft just barely, gulping water and struggling to stay afloat. I clawed my way up the rusted ladder like a shipwrecked rat, sprawling across the splintered weather-worn dock-top. I lay there like that for at least 10 minutes, eyes to the heavens, gasping for air.
As I breathed in deeply my exhaustion dissipated only to slowly be replaced by a different tingling sense. Despite the sun now shining down and warming me, I could feel goosebumps forming across my arms and legs. Was it my brush with drowning that had me set on edge? No, that wasn’t what was gnawing at me. A feeling that I wasn’t alone anymore filled up my insides until I could hardly stand it. I was suddenly acutely aware that I was being watched. Against my nerves, I forced myself to abruptly sit up and search the shoreline for whom or what had triggered my alarm bells.
I spotted the cause in an instant, at the place where the forest met the water a figure stood in the mist. The Grey Man was there watching me. The only thing that separated us was the 30 or so yards of water between the Raft and shore.
The two of us remained like that, me seated on the raft, the Grey Man on the shore, as we studied each other. That was the longest unobstructed look I even got of the Grey Man and I am still at a loss for how to describe him. He was like a shadow with depth and weight. He had hair but I couldn’t tell you the color. He had features on his face. A nose, a mouth. But I couldn’t tell you if they were distinguished or petite. He had eyes, but I couldn’t tell you what color. He wore clothes, but I couldn’t tell you their style. He was just there, the suggestion of a man, lacking the definition to make him complete.
I was locked in an internal struggle, my mind fighting to make sense of what it was seeing, when the Grey Man stepped his foot forward from shore and plunged it into the lake. As it entered the water bubbles churned and droplets splashed down in utter silence. There was no sound. Then he stepped again and in muted motions began to wade toward me and my haven upon the raft.
As the Grey Man approached, inching deeper and deeper with each step, he did not attempt to swim. He continued forward in a march, feet firm upon the lakebed. The deeper he got, the more the water rose. To his waist, then his chest, then his shoulders. Still, the Grey Man pushed forward.
Still 15 yards away from the raft, the Grey Man’s head slipped below the water, a final ripple, and then there was nothing. I waited as the mirror-like tranquility slowly returned to the surface of the lake. Uneasy at the change in atmosphere, I jumped to my feet attempting to center myself on the raft. Feeling in that moment more exposed, vulnerable, and trapped than I had ever felt before.
In anticipation of an attack, I frantically searched around the raft’s edges, looking for fingers and hands reaching up to pull the Grey Man to the surface. All I could picture in my head was the final scene in Friday the 13th (the first one), where Jason burst up from the water and grabs a hold of the lone survivor as she sits in a boat, pulling her down to her death. I knew any minute that the same end would come for me.
Yet time marched on and nothing happened. An impossible amount of time, far to long for a person to remain submerged. They say time ticks by slowly in moments of crisis, but even so, I knew that it had been long enough that any man would have needed to come up for air by now.
Where was the Grey Man? I turned my search back to the shore. Had he retreated there while I was distracted with my search around the raft? If the Grey Man didn’t make a sound when he entered the water, maybe he had left in the same silence. Could he be gone? That was something that I desperately wanted to believe, but just couldn’t convince myself was true. He was still down there in the depths below, waiting for me.
As the sun rose high and reached midday it beat down on me, I began to despair. How long could I remain here before I needed to force an attempt to swim back home? I could feel the sweat being pulled out of my body by humidity that wrapped me and weighed on me like a blanket. I was already starting to get dehydrated, yet I was surrounded by fresh water I didn’t dare attempt to drink. I knew the moment I cupped my hands in the water, the trap would be sprung and I’d be pulled under.
I was stuck there, able to see my house but unable to do anything to save myself. Legs aching, throat bone dry, fear consuming me yet all I could do was wait and hope someone spotted me and came to my rescue.
It was near dinner time, 12 hours after I set out that morning, before my cousin made his way down to the opposite lakeshore. My initial screams for help were dry hoarse pathetic yelps, but eventually, I got out few good yells and caught his attention enough that he looked my way and could see me jumping and waving to him from across the lake.
Minutes later I saw him and my uncle hop in their fishing boat to make their way across to where I stood stranded. That was the longest period for me, when hope crept back inside me but rescue still seemed so far off.
When they reached me I yammered off about how I had cramped up during my swim. My uncle scolded me for being so stupid to swim out this far alone. When I began to mention the Grey Man my uncle flashed me a skeptical accusing look, then motioned around arms held wide as if to say “There’s nothing here, you crazy kid.”
I clammed up quickly at that point. Kids have an odd fear of adults not believing them, it’s as if their own eyes are less reliable than adult logic. Once I was on the boat myself, I even began to feel silly about how I acted. The sheer amount of time had I wasted on that raft, worried about something lurking in the water, the whole time perfectly safe to dive in and swim home whenever I wanted. How much had I suffered because my mind ran wild with horror movie scenarios?
As we pulled away and began the trip home a fit of hysterical laugher began to bubble out of me. I laughed at myself, the stupidity of my irrational actions, and the absurdity of the situation I had put myself in.
That laughter died in my throat the moment I looked back at the raft. Directly beneath it, between the barrel pontoons that kept it afloat, was a head extended above the water. The Grey Man had been there below me, less than a foot away, waiting for me the whole time. If I had done anything other than what I did, made any different choices, he would have had me.
I grabbed at my uncle excitedly, pointing at the raft, begging him to look at what was there. But by the time he turned to follow my direction, there was nothing to be seen. The Grey Man had vanished again.
That night I struggled to sleep, a full day spent unprotected and exposed under the harsh sun had taken its toll. My sunburn had already begun to blister and I knew the next few days would be miserable. That night the pain wouldn’t even allow me to lie down on my bed. Instead, I stood in the darkness of my room, looking out the window. The moon was full, bathing the lake in light nearly as crisp as daytime. Under the moonlight, I could see clear across the lake, and spotted the raft. Upon it, I saw a shadow-like figure standing there, looking back at me."	9.67	18.0	E.K. Kelly	06/22/2020
The Salem Horror	"When Carson first noticed the sounds in his cellar, he ascribed them to the rats. Later he began to hear the tales which were whispered by the superstitious Polish mill workers in Derby Street regarding the first occupant of the ancient house, Abigail Prinn. There was none living today who could remember the diabolical old hag, but the morbid legends which thrive in the “witch district” of Salem like rank weeds on a neglected grave gave disturbing particulars of her activities, and were unpleasantly explicit regarding the detestable sacrifices she was known to have made to a worm-eaten, crescent-horned image of dubious origin. The oldsters still muttered of Abbie Prinn and her monstrous boasts that she was high priestess of a fearfully potent god which dwelt deep in the hills. Indeed, it was the old witch’s reckless boasting which had led to her abrupt and mysterious death in 1692, about the time of the famous hangings on Gallows Hill. No one liked to talk about it, but occasionally a toothless crone would mumble fearfully that the flames could not burn her, for her whole body had taken on the peculiar anesthesia of her witch-mark.
Abbie Prinn and her anomalous statue had long since vanished, but it was still difficult to find tenants for her decrepit, gabled house, with its overhanging second story and curious diamond-paned casement windows. The house’s evil notoriety had spread throughout Salem. Nothing had actually happened there of recent years which might give rise to the inexplicable tales, but those who rented the house had a habit of moving out hastily, generally with vague and unsatisfactory explanations connected with the rats.
And it was a rat which led Carson to the Witch Room. The squealing and muffled pattering within the rotting walls had disturbed Carson more than once during the nights of his first week in the house, which he had rented to obtain the solitude that would enable him to complete a novel for which his publishers had been asking— another light romance to add to Carson’s long string of popular successes. But it was not until sometime later that he began to entertain certain wildly fantastic surmises regarding the intelligence of the rat that scurried from under his feet in the dark hallway one evening.
The house had been wired for electricity, but the bulb in the hall was small and gave a dim light. The rat was a misshapen, black shadow as it darted a few feet away and paused, apparently watching him.
At another time Carson might have dismissed the animal with a threatening gesture and returned to his work. But the traffic on Derby Street had been unusually noisy, and he had found it difficult to concentrate upon his novel. His nerves, for no apparent reason, were taut; and somehow it seemed that the rat, watching just beyond his reach, was eyeing him with sardonic amusement.
Smiling at the conceit, he took a few steps toward the rat, and it rushed away to the cellar door, which he saw with surprise was ajar. He must have neglected to close it the last time he had been in the cellar, although he generally took care to keep the doors shut, for the ancient house was drafty. The rat waited in the doorway.
Unreasonably annoyed, Carson hurried forward, sending the rat scurrying down the stairway. He switched on the cellar light and observed the rat in a corner. It watched him keenly out of glittering little eyes.
As he descended the stairs he could not help feeling that he was acting like a fool. But his work had been tiring, and subconsciously he welcomed any interruption. He moved across the cellar to the rat, seeing with astonishment that the creature remained unmoving, staring at him. A strange feeling of uneasiness began to grow within him. The rat was acting abnormally, he felt; and the unwinking gaze of its cold shoe-button eyes was somehow disturbing.
Then he laughed to himself, for the rat had suddenly whisked aside and disappeared into a little hole in the cellar wall. Idly he scratched a cross with his toe in the dirt before the burrow, deciding that he would set a trap there in the morning.
The rat’s snout and ragged whiskers protruded cautiously. It moved forward and then hesitated, drew back. Then the animal began to act in a singular and unaccountable manner—almost as though it were dancing, Carson thought. It moved tentatively forward, retreated again. It would give a little dart forward and be brought up short, then leap back hastily, as though—the simile flashed into Carson’s mind—a snake were coiled before the burrow, alert to prevent the rat’s escape. But there was nothing there save the little cross Carson had scratched in the dust.
No doubt it was Carson himself who blocked the rat’s escape, for he was standing within a few feet of the burrow. He moved forward, and the animal hurriedly retreated out of sight.
His interest piqued, Carson found a stick and poked it exploringly into the hole. As he did so his eye, close to the wall, detected something strange about the stone slab just above the rat burrow. A quick glance around its edge confirmed his suspicion. The slab was apparently movable.
Carson examined it closely, noticed a depression on its edge which would afford a handhold. His fingers fitted easily into the groove, and he pulled tentatively. The stone moved a trifle and stopped. He pulled harder, and with a sprinkling of dry earth the slab swung away from the wall as though on hinges.
A black rectangle, shoulder-high, gaped in the wall. From its depths a musty, unpleasant stench of dead air welled out, and involuntarily Carson retreated a step. Suddenly he remembered the monstrous tales of Abbie Prinn and the hideous secrets she was supposed to have kept hidden in her house. Had he stumbled upon some hidden retreat of the long-dead witch?
Before entering the dark gap he took the precaution of obtaining a flashlight from upstairs. Then he cautiously bent his head and stepped into the narrow, evil-smelling passage, sending the flashlight’s beam probing out before him.
He was in a narrow tunnel, scarcely higher than his head, and walled and paved with stone slabs. It ran straight ahead for perhaps fifteen feet, and then broadened out into a roomy chamber. As Carson stepped into the underground room—no doubt a hidden retreat of Abbie Prinn’s, a hiding-place, he thought, which nevertheless could not save her on the day the fright-crazed mob had come raging along Derby Street—he caught “his breath in a gasp of amazement. The room was fantastic, astonishing.
It was the floor which held Carson’s gaze. The dull gray of the circular wall gave place here to a mosaic of varicolored stone, in which blues and greens and purples predominated—indeed, there were none of the warmer colors. There must have been thousands of bits of colored stone making up that pattern, for none was larger than a walnut. And the mosaic seemed to follow some definite pattern, unfamiliar to Carson; there were curves of purple and violet mingled with angled lines of green and blue, intertwining in fantastic arabesques. There were circles, triangles, a pentagram, and other, less familiar, figures. Most of the lines and figures radiated from a definite point: the center of the chamber, where there was a circular disk of dead black stone perhaps two feet in diameter.
It was very silent. The sounds of the cars that occasionally went past overhead in Derby Street could not be heard. In a shallow alcove in the wall Carson caught a glimpse of markings on the walls, and he moved slowly in that direction, the beam of his light traveling up and down the walls of the niche.
The marks, whatever they were, had been daubed upon the stone long ago, for what was left of the cryptic symbols was indecipherable. Carson saw several partly effaced hieroglyphics which reminded him of Arabic, but he could not be sure. On the floor of the alcove was a corroded metal disk about eight feet in diameter, and Carson received the distinct impression that it was movable. But there seemed no way to lift it.
He became conscious that he was standing in the exact center of the chamber, in the circle of black stone where the odd design centered. Again he noticed the utter silence. On an impulse he clicked off the ray of his flashlight. Instantly he was in dead blackness.
At that moment a curious idea entered his mind. He pictured himself at the bottom of a pit, and from above a flood was descending, pouring down the shaft to engulf him. So strong was this impression that he actually fancied he could hear a muffled thundering, the roar of the cataract. Then, oddly shaken, he clicked on the light, glanced around swiftly. The drumming, of course, was the pounding of his blood, made audible in the complete silence—a familiar phenomenon. But, if the place was so still—
The thought leaped into his mind, as though suddenly thrust into his consciousness. This would be an ideal place to work. He could have the place wired for electricity, have a table and chair brought down, use an electric fan if necessary—although the musty odor he had first noticed seemed to have disappeared completely. He moved to the tunnel mouth, and as he stepped from the room he felt an inexplicable relaxation of his muscles, although he had not realized that they had been contracted. He ascribed it to nervousness, and went upstairs to brew black coffee and write to his landlord in Boston about his discovery.
The visitor stared curiously about the hallway after Carson had opened the door, nodding to himself as though with satisfaction. He was a lean, tll figure of a man, with thick steel-gray eyebrows overhanging keen gray eyes. His face, although strongly marked and gaunt, was unwrinkled.
“About the Witch Room, I suppose?” Carson said ungraciously. His landlord had talked, and for the last week he had been unwillingly entertaining antiquaries and occultists anxious to glimpse the secret chamber in which Abbie Prinn had mumbled her spells. Carson’s annoyance had grown, and he had considered moving to a quieter place; but his inherent stubbornness had made him stay on, determined to finish his novel in spite of interruptions. Now, eyeing his guest coldly, he said, “I’m sorry, but it’s not on exhibition anymore.”
The other looked startled, but almost immediately a gleam of comprehension came into his eyes. He extracted a card and offered it to Carson.
“Michael Leigh… occultist, eh?” Carson repeated. He drew a deep breath. The occultists, he had found, were the worst, with their dark hints of nameless things and their profound interest in the mosaic pattern on the floor of the Witch Room. “I’m sorry, Mr. Leigh, but—I’m really quite busy. You’ll excuse me.”
Ungraciously he turned back to the door.
“Just a moment,” Leigh said swiftly.
Before Carson could protest he had caught the writer by the shoulders and was peering closely into his eyes. Startled, Carson drew back, but not before he had seen an extraordinary expression of mingled apprehension and satisfaction appear on Leigh’s gaunt face. It was as though the occultist had seen something unpleasant—but not unexpected.
“What’s the idea?” Carson asked harshly. “I’m not accustomed—”
“I’m very sorry,” Leigh said. His voice was deep, pleasant. “I must apologize. I thought—well, again I apologize. I’m rather excited, I’m afraid. You see, I’ve come from San Francisco to see this Witch Room of yours. Would you really mind letting me see it? I should be glad to pay any sum—”
Carson made a deprecatory gesture.
“No,” he said, feeling a perverse liking for this man growing within him—his well-modulated, pleasant voice, his powerful face, his magnetic personality. “No, I merely want a little peace—you have no idea how I’ve been bothered,” he went on, vaguely surprised to find himself speaking apologetically. “It’s a frightful nuisance. I almost wish I’d never found the room.”
Leigh leaned forward anxiously. “May I see it? It means a great deal to me—I’m vitally interested in these things. I promise not to take up more than ten minutes of your time.”
Carson-hesitated, then assented. As he led his guest into the cellar he found himself telling the circumstances of his discovery of the Witch Room. Leigh listened intently, occasionally interrupting with questions.
“The rat—did you see what became of it?” he asked.
Carson looked bemused. “Why, no. I suppose it hid in its burrow. Why?”
“One never knows,” Leigh said cryptically as they came into the Witch Room.
Carson switched on the light. He had had an electrical extension installed, and there were a few chairs and a table, but otherwise, the chamber was unchanged. Carson watched the occultist’s face, and with surprise saw it become grim, almost angry.
Leigh strode to the center of the room, staring at the chair that stood on the black circle of stone. “You work here?” he asked slowly.
“Yes. It’s quiet—I found I couldn’t work upstairs. Too noisy. But this is ideal—somehow I find it very easy to write here. My mind feels”—he hesitated—”free; that is, disassociated with other things. It’s quite an unusual feeling.”
Leigh nodded as though Carson’s words had confirmed some idea in his own mind. He turned toward the alcove and the metal disk in the floor. Carson followed him. The occultist moved close to the wall, tracing out the faded symbols with a long forefinger. He muttered something under his breath—words that sounded like gibberish to Carson.
“Nyogtha… k’yarnak…”
He swung about, his face grim and pale. “I’ve seen enough,” he said softly. “Shall we go?” Surprised, Carson nodded and led the way back into the cellar.
Upstairs Leigh hesitated, as though finding it difficult to broach his subject. At length he asked, “Mr. Carson—would you mind telling me if you have had any peculiar dreams lately.”
Carson stared at him, mirth dancing in his eyes. “Dreams?” he repeated. “Oh—I see. Well, Mr. Leigh, I may as well tell you that you can’t frighten me. Your compatriots—the other occultists I’ve tertained— have already tried it.”
Leigh raised his thick eyebrows. “Yes? Did they ask you whether you’d dreamed?”
“Several did—yes.”
“And you told them?”
“No.” Then as Leigh leaned back in his chair, a puzzled expression on his face, Carson went on slowly, “Although, really, I’m not quite sure.”
“You mean?”
“I think—I have a vague impression—that I have dreamed lately. But I can’t be sure. I can’t remember anything of the dream, you see. And—oh, very probably your brother occultists put the idea into my mind!”
“Perhaps,” Leigh said non-committally, getting up. He hesitated. “Mr. Carson, I’m going to ask you a rather presumptuous question. Is it necessary for you to live in this house?”
Carson sighed resignedly. “When I was first asked that question I explained that I wanted a quiet place to work on a novel, and that any quiet place would do. But it isn’t easy to find ‘em. Now that I have this Witch Room, and I’m turning out my work so easily, I see no reason why I should move and perhaps upset my program. I’ll vacate this house when I finish my novel, and then you occultists can come in and turn it into a museum or do whatever you want with it. I don’t care. But until the novel is finished I intend to stay here.”
Leigh rubbed his chin. “Indeed. I can understand your point of view. But—is there no other place in the house where you can work?” He watched Carson’s face for a moment, and then went on swiftly.
“I don’t expect you to believe me. You are a materialist. Most people are. But there are a few of us who know that above and beyond what men call science there is a greater science that is built on laws and principles which to the average man would be almost incomprehensible. If you have read Machen you will remember that he speaks of the gulf between the world of consciousness and the world of matter. It is possible to bridge that gulf. The Witch Room is such a bridge! Do you know what a whispering-gallery is?”
“Eh?” Carson said, staring. “But there’s no—”
“An analogy—merely an analogy. A man may whisper a word in gallery—or a cave—and if you are standing in a certain spot a hundred feet away you will hear that whisper, although someone ten feet away will not. It’s a simple trick of acoustics—bringing the sound to a focal point. And this principle can be applied to other things besides sound. To any wave impulse—even to thought!”
Carson tried to interrupt, but Leigh kept on.
“That black stone in the center of your Witch Room is one of those focal points. The design on the floor—when you sit on the black circle there you are abnormally sensitive to certain vibrations— certain thought commands—dangerously sensitive! Why do you suppose your mind is so clear when you are working there? A deception, a false feeling of lucidity—for you are merely an instrument, a microphone, tuned to pick up certain malign vibrations the nature of which you could not comprehend!”
Carson’s face Was a study in amazement and incredulity. “But—you don’t mean you actually believe—”
Leigh drew back, the intensity fading from his eyes, leaving them grim and cold. “Very well. But I have studied the history of your Abigail Prinn. She, too, understood the super-science of which I speak. She used it for evil purposes—the black art, as it is called. I have read that she cursed Salem in the old days—and a witch’s curse can be a frightful thing. Will you—” He got up, gnawing at his lip.
“Will you, at least, allow me to call on you tomorrow?”
Almost involuntarily Carson nodded. “But I’m afraid you’ll be wasting your time. I don’t believe—I mean, I have no—” He stumbled, at a loss for words.
“I merely wish to assure myself that you—oh, another thing. If you dream tonight, will you try to remember the dream? If you attempt to recapture it immediately after waking, it is often possible to recall it.”
“All right. If I dream—”
That night Carson dreamed. He awoke just before dawn with his heart racing furiously and a curious feeling of uneasiness. Within the walls and from below he could hear the furtive scurryings of the rats. He got out of bed hastily, shivering in the cold grayness of early morning. A wan moon still shone faintly in a paling sky.
Then he remembered Leigh’s words. He had dreamed—there was no question of that. But the content of his dream—that was another matter. He absolutely could not recall it to his mind, much as he tried, although there was a very vague impression of running frantically in darkness.
He dressed quickly, and because the stillness of early morning in the old house got on his nerves, went out to buy a newspaper. It was too early for shops to be open, however, and in search of a news-boy he set off westward, turning at the first corner. And as he walked a curious and inexplicable feeling began to take possession of him: a feeling of—familiarity! He had walked here before, and there was a dim and disturbing familiarity about the shapes of the houses, the outline of the roofs. But—and this was the fantastic part of it—to his knowledge he had never been on this street before. He had spent little time walking about this region of Salem, for he was indolent by nature; yet there was this extraordinary feeling of remembrance, and it grew more vivid as he went on.
He reached a corner, turned unthinkingly to the left. The odd sensation increased. He walked on slowly, pondering.
No doubt he had traveled by this way before—and very probably he had done so in a brown study, so that he had not been conscious of his route. Undoubtedly that was the explanation. Yet as Carson turned into Charter Street he felt a nameless unease waking within him. Salem was rousing; with daylight impassive Polish workers began to hurry past him toward the mills. An occasional automobile went by.
Before him a crowd was gathered on the sidewalk. He hastened his steps, conscious of a feeling of impending calamity. With an extraordinary sense of shock he saw that he was passing the Charter Street Burying Ground, the ancient, evilly famous “Burying Point.” Hastily he pushed his way into the crowd.
Comments in a muffled undertone came to Carson’s ears, and a bulky blue-clad back loomed up before him. He peered over the policeman’s shoulder and caught his breath in a horrified gasp. A man leaned against the iron railing that fenced the old graveyard. He wore a cheap, gaudy suit, and he gripped the rusty bars in a clutch that made the muscles stand out in ridges on the hairy backs of his hands. He was dead, and on his face, staring up at the sky at a crazy angle, was frozen an expression of abysmal and utterly shocking horror. His eyes, all whites, were bulging hideously; his mouth was a twisted, mirthless grin.
A man at Carson’s side turned a white face toward him. “Looks as if he was scared to death,” he said somewhat hoarsely. “I’d hate to have seen what he saw. Ugh—look at that face!”
Mechanically Carson backed away, feeling an icy breath of nameless things chill him. He rubbed his hand across his eyes, but still that contorted, dead face swam in his vision. He began to retrace his steps, shaken and trembling a little. Involuntarily his glance moved aside, rested on the tombs and monuments that dotted the old graveyard. No one had been buried there for over a century, and the lichen-stained tombstones, with their winged skulls, fat-cheeked cherubs, and funeral urns, seemed to breathe out an indefinable miasma of antiquity. What had frightened the man to death?
Carson drew a deep breath. True, the corpse had been a frightful spectacle, but he must not allow it to upset his nerves. He could not— his novel would suffer. Besides, he argued grimly to himself, the affair was obvious enough in its explanation. The dead man was apparently a Pole, one of the group of immigrants who dwell about Salem Harbor. Passing by the graveyard at night, a spot about which eldritch legends had clung for nearly three centuries, his drink-befuddled eyes must have given reality to the hazy phantoms of a superstitious mind. These Poles were notoriously unstable emotionally, prone to mob hysteria and wild imaginings. The great Immigrant Panic of 1853, in which three witch-houses had been burned to the ground, had grown from an old woman’s confused and hysterical statement that she had seen a mysterious white-clad foreigner “take off his face.” What else could be expected of such people, Carson thought?
Nevertheless he remained in a nervous state, and did not return home until nearly noon. When on his arrival he found Leigh, the occultist, waiting, he was glad to see the man, and invited him in with cordiality.
Leigh was very serious. “Did you hear about your friend Abigail Prinn?” he asked without preamble, and Carson stared, pausing in the act of siphoning charged water into a glass. After a long moment he pressed the lever, sent the liquid sizzling and foaming into the whiskey. He handed Leigh the drink and took one himself—neat— before answering the question.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Has—what’s she been up to?” he asked, with an air of forced levity.
“I’ve been checking up the records,” Leigh said, “and I find Abigail Prinn was buried on December 14th, 1690, in the Charter Street Burying Ground—with a stake through her heart. What’s the matter?”
“Nothing,” Carson said tonelessly. “Well?”
“Well—her grave’s been opened and robbed, that’s all. The stake was found uprooted nearby, and there were footprints all around the grave. Shoe-prints. Did you dream last night, Carson?” Leigh snapped out the question, his gray eyes hard.
“I don’t know,” Carson said confusedly, rubbing his forehead. “I can’t remember. I was at the Charter Street graveyard this morning.”
“Oh. Then you must have heard something about the man who—”
“I saw him,” Carson interrupted, shuddering. “It upset me.”
He downed the whiskey at a gulp.
Leigh watched him. “Well,” he said presently, “are you still determined to stay in this house?”
Carson put down the glass and stood up.
“Why not?” he snapped. “Is there any reason why I shouldn’t? Eh?” “After what happened last night—”
“After what happened? A grave was robbed. A superstitious Pole saw the robbers and died of fright. Well?”
“You’re trying to convince yourself,” Leigh said calmly. “In your heart you know—you must know—the truth. You’ve become a tool in the hands of tremendous terrible forces, Carson. For three centuries Abbie Prinn has lain in her grave—undead—waiting for someone to fall into her trap—the Witch Room. Perhaps she foresaw the future when she built it, foresaw that someday someone would blunder into that hellish chamber and be caught by the trap of the mosaic pattern. It caught you, Carson—and enabled that undead horror to bridge the gulf between consciousness and matter, to get en rapport with you. Hypnotism is child’s play to a being with Abigail Prinn’s frightful powers. She could very easily force you to go to her grave and uproot the stake that held her captive, and then erase the memory of that act from your mind so that you could not remember it even as a dream!”
Carson was on his feet, his eyes burning with a strange light. “In God’s name, man, do you know what you’re saying?”
Leigh laughed harshly. “God’s name! The devil’s name, rather—the devil that menaces Salem at this moment; for Salem is in danger, terrible danger. The men and women and children of the town Abbie Prinn cursed when they bound her to the stake—and found they couldn’t burn her! I’ve been going through certain secret archives this morning, and I’ve come to ask you, for the last time, to leave this house.”
“Are you through?” Carson asked coldly. “Very well. I shall stay here. You’re either insane or drunk, but you can’t impress me with your poppycock.”
“Would you leave if I offered you a thousand dollars?” Leigh asked. “Or more, then—ten thousand? I have a considerable sum at my command.”
“No, damn it!” Carson snapped in a sudden blaze of anger. “All I want, is to be left alone to finish my novel. I can’t work anywhere else—I don’t want to, I won’t—”
“I expected this,” Leigh said, his voice suddenly quiet, and with a strange note of sympathy. “Man, you can’t get away! You’re caught in the trap, and it’s too late for you to extricate yourself so long as Abbie Prinn’s brain controls you through the Witch Room. And the worst part of it is that she can only manifest herself with your aid—she drains your life forces, Carson, feeds on you like a vampire.” “You’re mad,” Carson said dully.
“I’m afraid. That iron disk in the Witch Room—I’m afraid of that, and what’s under it. Abbie Prinn served strange gods, Carson—and I read something on the wall of that alcove that gave me a hint. Have you ever heard of Nyogtha?”
Carson shook his head impatiently. Leigh fumbled in a pocket, drew out a scrap of paper. “I copied this from a book in the Kester Library,” he said, “a book called the Necronomicon, written by a man who delved so deeply into forbidden secrets that men called him mad. Read this.”
Carson’s brows drew together as he read the excerpt:
Men know him as the Dweller in Darkness, that brother of the Old Ones called Nyogtha, the Thing that should not be. He can be summoned to Earth’s surface through certain secret caverns and fissures, and sorcerers have seen him in Syria and below the black tower of Leng; from the Thang Grotto of Tartary he has come ravening to bring terror and destruction among the pavilions of the great Khan. Only by the looped cross, by the Vach-Viraj incantation, and by the Tikkoun elixir may he be driven back to the nighted caverns of hidden foulness where he dwelleth.
Leigh met Carson’s puzzled gaze calmly. “Do you understand now?” “Incantations and elixirs!” Carson said, handing back the paper.
“Fiddlesticks!”
“Far from it. That incantation and that elixir have been known to occultists and adepts for thousands of years. I’ve had occasion to use them myself in the past on certain—occasions. And if I’m right about this thing—” He turned to the door, his lips compressed in a bloodless line. “Such manifestations have been defeated before, but the difficulty lies in obtaining the elixir—it’s very hard to get. But I hope… I’ll be back. Can you stay out of the Witch Room until then?”
“I’ll promise nothing,” Carson said. He had a dull headache, which had been steadily growing until it obtruded upon his consciousness, and he felt vaguely nauseated. “Good-bye.”
He saw Leigh to the door and waited on the steps, with an odd reluctance to return to the house. As he watched the tall occultist hurry down the street, a woman came out of the adjoining house. She caught sight of him, and her huge breasts heaved. She burst into a shrill, angry tirade.
Carson turned, staring at her with astonished eyes. His head throbbed painfully. The woman was approaching, shaking a fat fist threateningly.
“Why you scare my Sarah?” she cried, her swarthy face flushed. “Why you scare her wit’ your fool tricks, eh?” Carson moistened his lips.
“I’m sorry,” he said slowly. “Very sorry. I didn’t frighten your Sarah. I haven’t been home all day. What frightened her?”
“T’e brown t’ing—it ran in your house, Sarah say—”
The woman paused, and her jaw dropped. Her eyes widened. She made a peculiar sign with her right hand—pointing her index and little fingers at Carson, while her thumb was crossed over the other fingers. “T’e old witch!”
She retreated hastily, muttering in Polish in a frightened voice.
Carson turned, went back into the house. He poured some whiskey into a tumbler, considered, and then set it aside untasted. He began to pace the floor, occasionally rubbing his forehead with fingers that felt dry and hot. Vague, confused thoughts raced through his mind. His head was throbbing and feverish.
At length he went down to the Witch Room. He remained there, although he did not work; for his headache was not so oppressive in the dead quiet of the underground chamber. After a time he slept.
How long he slumbered he did not know. He dreamed of Salem, and of a dimly glimpsed, gelatinous black thing that hurtled with frightful speed through the streets, a thing like an incredibly huge, jet-black amoeba that pursued and engulfed men and women who shrieked and fled vainly. He dreamed of a skull-face peering into his own, a withered and shrunken countenance in which only the eyes seemed alive, and they shone with a hellish and evil light.
He awoke at last, sat up with a start. He was very cold.
It was utterly silent. In the light of the electric bulb the green and purple mosaic seemed to writhe and contract toward him, an illusion which disappeared as his sleep-fogged vision cleared. He glanced at his wrist-watch. It was two o’clock. He had slept through the afternoon and the better part of the night.
He felt oddly weak, and a lassitude held him motionless in his chair. The strength seemed to have been drained from him. The piercing cold seemed to strike through to his brain, but his headache was gone. His mind was very clear—expectant, as though waiting for something to happen. A movement nearby caught his eye.
A slab of stone in the wall was moving. He heard a gentle grating sound, and slowly a black cavity widened from a narrow rectangle to a square. There was something crouching there in the shadow. Stark, blind horror struck through Carson as the thing moved and crept forward into the light.
It looked like a mummy. For an intolerable, age-long second the thought pounded frightfully at Carson’s brain: It looked like a mummy! It was a skeleton-thin, parchment-brown corpse, and it looked like a skeleton with the hide of some great lizard stretched over its bones. It stirred, it crept forward, and its long nails scratched audibly against the stone. It crawled out into the Witch Room, its passionless face pitilessly revealed in the white light, and its eyes were gleaming with charnel life. He could see the serrated ridge of its brown, shrunken back….
Carson sat motionless. Abysmal horror had robbed him of the power to move. He seemed to be caught in the fetters of dream-paralysis, in which the brain, an aloof spectator, is unable or unwilling to transmit the nerve-impulses to the muscles. He told himself frantically that he was dreaming, that he would presently awaken.
The withered horror arose. It stood upright, skeleton-thin, and moved to the alcove where the iron disk lay embedded in the floor. Standing with its back to Carson it paused, and a dry and sere whisper rustled out in the dead stillness. At the sound Carson would have screamed, but he could not. Still the dreadful whisper went on, in a language Carson knew was not of Earth, and as though in response an almost imperceptible quiver shook the iron disk.
It quivered and began to rise, very slowly, and as if in triumph the shriveled horror lifted its pipestem arms. The disk was nearly a foot thick, but presently as it continued to rise above the level of the floor an insidious odor began to penetrate the room. It was vaguely reptilian, musky and nauseating. The disk lifted inexorably, and a little finger of blackness crept out from beneath its edge. Abruptly Carson remembered his dream of a gelatinous black creature that hurtled through the Salem streets. He tried vainly to break the fetters of paralysis that held him motionless. The chamber was darkening, and a black vertigo was creeping up to engulf him. The room seemed to rock. Still the iron disk lifted; still the withered horror stood with its skeleton arms raised in blasphemous benediction; still the blackness oozed out in slow amoeboid movement.
There came a sound breaking through the sere whisper of the mummy, the quick patter of racing footsteps. Out of the corner of his eye Carson saw a man come racing into the Witch Room. It was the occultist, Leigh, and his eyes were blazing in a face of deathly pallor. He flung himself past Carson to the alcove where the black horror was surging into view.
The withered thing turned with dreadful slowness. Leigh carried some implement in his left hand, Carson saw, a crux ansata of gold and ivory. His right hand was clenched at his side. His voice rolled out, sonorous and commanding. There were little beads of perspiration on his white face.
“Ya na kadishtu nil gh’ri… stell’bsna kn’aa Nyogtha… k’yarnak phlegethor….”
The fantastic, unearthly syllables thundered out, echoing from the walls of the vault. Leigh advanced slowly, the crux ansata held high.
And from beneath the iron disk black horror came surging!
The disk was lifted, flung aside, and a great wave of iridescent blackness, neither liquid nor solid, a frightful gelatinous mass, came pouring straight for Leigh. Without pausing in his advance he made a quick gesture with his right hand, and a little glass tube hurtled at the black thing, was engulfed.
The formless horror paused. It hesitated, with a dreadful air of indecision, and then swiftly drew back. A choking stench of burning corruption began to pervade the air, and Carson saw great pieces of the black thing flake off, shriveling as though destroyed with corroding acid. It fled back in a liquescent rush, hideous black flesh dropping as it retreated.
A pseudopod of blackness elongated itself from the central mass and like a great tentacle clutched the corpse-like being, dragged it back to the pit and over the brink. Another tentacle seized the iron disk, pulled it effortlessly across the floor, and as the horror sank from sight, the disk fell into place with a thunderous crash.
The room swung in wide circles about Carson, and a frightful nausea clutched him. He made a tremendous effort to get to his feet, and then the light faded swiftly and was gone. Darkness took him.
Carson’s novel was never finished. He burned it, but continued to write, although none of his later work was ever published. His publishers shook their heads and wondered why such a brilliant writer of popular fiction had suddenly become infatuated with the weird and ghastly.
“It’s powerful stuff,” one man told Carson, as he handed back his novel, Black God of Madness. “It’s remarkable in its way, but it’s morbid and horrible. Nobody would read it. Carson, why don’t you write the type of novel you used to do, the kind that made you famous?”
It was then that Carson broke his vow never to speak of the Witch Room, and he poured out the entire story, hoping for understanding and belief. But as he finished, his heart sank as he saw the other’s face, sympathetic but skeptical.
“You dreamed it, didn’t you?” the man asked, and Carson laughed bitterly.
“Yes—I dreamed it.”
“It must have made a terribly vivid impression on your mind. Some dreams do. But you’ll forget about it in time,” he predicted, and Carson nodded.
And because he knew that he would only be arousing doubts of his sanity, he did not mention the thing that was burned indelibly on his brain, the horror he had seen in the Witch Room after wakening from his faint. Before he and Leigh had hurried, white-faced and trembling, from the chamber, Carson had cast a quick glance behind him. The shriveled and corroded patches that he had seen slough off from that being of insane blasphemy had unaccountably disappeared, although they had left black stains upon the stones. Abbie Prinn, perhaps, had returned to the hell she had served, and her inhuman god had withdrawn to hidden abysses beyond man’s comprehension, routed by powerful forces of elder magic which the occultist had commanded. But the witch had left a memento behind her, a hideous thing which Carson, in that last backward glance, had seen protruding from the edge of the iron disk, as though raised in ironic salute—a withered, claw-like hand!"	9.76	17.0	Henry Kuttner	06/18/2020
Undecent	"The only proper way I can describe my childhood is that it was an afterthought for my parents.
Father worked two jobs, one as a cattle hand and the other as a busboy in Sydney. Even with the good tips he made from tourists, the money was just barely enough to help us survive. Mum often would let me stay home from school because I had no clean clothes or I smelled from lack of fresh water to bathe in.
“It isn’t lady-like,” she would say. She kept herself busy tending to the house, trying to make things as easy as possible for dad.
Each day felt like we were walking on eggshells around him, with little we could do except to be seen and not heard. He was an angry and bitter man, forced to do labor he thought was beneath him. And although he never spoke this, it seemed clear that he was unsatisfied with the life we led.
It became obvious the morning we heard the gunshot.
Dad had bought a hunting rifle, guaranteed to do the trick, and blew his head off. I still remember being awakened by the sound of the deafening blast and rushing downstairs, thinking it was a burglar. Instead I found him slumped over in his favorite chair, a fire burning behind him and his brains splattered across the mantle like it were some shoddy trophy. The rest of the scene was just as grisly.
His blood and sinew spilling out across the mahogany table, dribbling to the floor below with sickening precision from his neck, I cannot even recall how long I stood there in shock to see what my father had done to himself.
There was no note, no plea for forgiveness that he left behind. Just this gruesome act of betrayal toward me and mum, that he would rather we wallow in poverty than to be a part of our family and our lives any longer.
And wallow we did. For weeks, mum struggled to find work. Often she taught me to steal from grocery stores, corner cafes and even dumpsters. Anything to help us stave off hunger a few short moments.
It seemed impossible to imagine our nightmare could grow worse than this.
And yet it did.
His full name was Jeremiah Lankastier the III, but I was often told to call him Uncle Jeremy. He came from across the pond occasionally a few Christmases before dad passed, always bringing gifts to lavish mum and I with. A taste of a lifestyle we did not know.
But this visit was different.
The air felt heavy when I came downstairs and found him there. I knew very little about Uncle Jeremy except that he had a lot of money and that he gave me a creepy vibe. They say that you can sense when something is going to go wrong, like a premonition that blindsides you. Had my other senses not been in such shock from finding dad dead in the same chair that Jeremy sat in now, I feel as though I would have had such a vision.
Something about Jeremy felt off and his visit there that day especially so.
“Honey, take a seat. Your Uncle has some great news for the both of us,” mum said. I could tell from the tone of her voice she was trying to sound excited to deceive me. But mum had never liked Jeremy. And even at that tender age, I knew to sniff out a lie.
But ever obedient I sat and listened to what they had to say, and it was far stranger than any outlandish dream I had conjured up.
“Your Uncle Jeremy has offered to let us come over to Sussex and live with him at his estate. Just got a little bit of course. Until I can find a job and a place of our own,” mum explained.
I was speechless. I always imagined he lived in a castle with servants. But I never could picture it as a happy place to go. And now we are going to be stuck there. Prisoners because of my father’s pride.
Jeremy told us we had a day to pack, but there wasn’t much that needed to go. What little clothes I had were torn and eaten by moths. And everything else reminded me of dad.
I tried to be in good spirits leaving our home. I wanted this new life to be everything that dad had not given us. “When God closes a window, he opens a door,” mum said. “There are so many more opportunities for us in the Empire than there are here in the outback. You can go to school, learn to be a proper lady.”
I didn’t know what that meant, but I promised her I would try to adjust to what she felt was best for us. I wanted to make her proud.
I wanted to believe that we could have a good life at last.
* * * * * *
Belief, however strong it may be, is never as powerful as the harsh reality we live in. Coming to Uncle Jeremy’s estate shattered what little hope I had in a few short days.
The castle and servants I pictured him having were nothing more than overgrown fields with neglected cattle and abandoned rooms where he once catered to nobles. This house was a pigsty, and even as a child that grew up poor, I knew there was a difference between cheap and filthy. With his wife dead and his money run dry, Uncle Jeremy had let the place fall on hard times.
But… I knew all too well he was hoping our presence there would change all that.
“You’ll have chores of course. Keep ya busy till we get you in a school this fall. Wash the barns, scrub the floors. Need to show appreciation for what you have gotten,” Jeremy told me as he crunched on an apple.
It was clear that he felt we should view him as our savior and this… garbage heap… as our paradise.
And mum reinforced this by catering to his every whim.
“I didn’t have to come and offer you shelter. But that is what family does. We look out for each other. And that’s what we are goin’ta continue to do here in my home, ain’t we, Gloria?”
He would pet my hair and smile at me in that same bizarre way he always did. It would send a chill down my spine. This felt like servitude rather than freedom. And the weeks to come only further gave me reason to believe this was so.
* * * * * *
There is a certain part of you that dies when you are young that we don’t speak of often. The innocence and tenderness we all strive after but never admit we can’t rekindle.
I thought I had lost it when I saw my father die. But that was nothing compared to the living hell that my Uncle had me go through day by day that summer.
I did not understand it at the time, but Jeremy was a gambler and a terrible drunk. Often he would leave mum and I a list of chores to finish by evening and then return home at night, angry that we had not finished them all. Even when mum tried to show that we had and that he was misreading the lists, he would strike his hand across her cheek. Often I would see other bruises on her neck and arms where he had grabbed her and I would pine for her to come and find me in the night and for us to become vagabonds.
There was a night I heard her scream that I tried to run. It was selfish I know, but I could not bear the thought of the awful things Jeremy was doing to her any longer. But that only invited his wrath to come down hard on me.
I thought I had made a decent run for it, a day’s journey, only for him and mum to find me cradled up in a tree on the edge of his property.
“Mighty fine of you to just gallivant off like that in the middle of the night. You worried your mum sick,” Jeremy told me as he yanked me by my hair and tossed me to the ground.
“You best be thankful you got chores to do today or I would tan your hide so sore you couldn’t walk straight,” he snarled.
That only warned me of the vicious treatment to come. I remember looking to mum for guidance. A way to make this stop. But she just darted her eyes away, a broken and forlorn look in them as I realized she was submitting to his cruelty for our safety.
As the day went on, I resolved to take revenge on Jeremy that night. It was a simple childish plan to be sure but at the time it was all I knew.
I waited until he was home and had finished his second bottle of whiskey before I snuck to find the barber scissors mum often used to trim his beard.
I knew of why the screams she made in the night even though they expected me to still have some innocence and I planned to yank his trousers down and ship off his wanker like the codfish he was.
The droll of the telly told me he had collapsed in his lounge chair with bottles at his side for the night, unaware of my scheme. I crawled across the carpet to where he slept, and opened the scissors wide, thinking that with one swift cut I would solve our problems.
Instead, Uncle Jeremy’s eyes darted open and he glared at me with the look of the devil himself.
To this day I refuse to repeat what he did to me that night. I never knew it was possible to be so vile, so wicked. And anytime I tried to resist, it only made everything ten times worse.
Truthfully that was only the beginning of the cruel acts he did to me. Anytime he was unsatisfied with mum he would find me and pull me to my room, treating me like a rag doll for his enjoyment.
I think he liked the control it gave him.
As a child, I knew only how to obey and to fear. Mum was not going to defend me though, and eventually his wandering hands dared to touch places I knew were forbidden except to my future husband. In that moment I struck him. It was a scratch against his right cheek, so deep I drew blood.
To be honest I was trying to rip his face off. It was the first and last time I tried to fight back.
He took off his belt, eager to whip me into submission when mum begged at last for some mercy.
“This little twat needs to be taught manners. Learn her place in this family!” Uncle Jeremy barked as he calmed down, his fiery eyes pushing mum aside and glaring at me once more.
“What good is she if she won’t even listen to orders?!” he snapped.
I shielded myself, frightened he would strike again. Yet this time instead he was hesitant, his devious mind thinking of a proper punishment for my insolence.
“We will handle you in the morning, girl,” he said, snatching mum up and heading to the bedroom. I knew she was about to pay for what I had done to him in the worst way.
He locked me in my bedroom, leaving me to scratch and cry at the door. “That’s all you are, is a dog! And like all good dogs, you will learn obedience!” he snarled.
I found out precisely what he meant the next morning. Mum was nowhere to be seen, off handling errands to keep his meager estate afloat and instead I was greeted by an elderly woman at the bottom of the stairs.
She wore a black satin dress, long white gloves and laced stockings with a pair of knitting needles in her hair. Everything about her was prim and posed as though she were made of fine china, not a wrinkle on her clothes or a thread out of place.
Her sparkling green eyes turned to me in a playful way as she adjusted her cane and gave me a bow with her head.
“And you must be Gloria,” she said in a strong British accent.
Jeremy came around the corner from his den, looking like a gentleman for the first time since we had come here. His face shaved and his clothes pressed, I knew immediately he was trying to impress this woman whoever she was.
“I see you’ve met my niece. Good. Gloria, this is Madam Belfrost, of the Everstone Boarding School. She is here to… interview you,” Jeremy said as he straightened his tie. It was clear from the small act that he had little idea what he was doing.
And to be fair I didn’t either. My entire world felt like it was spinning. I knew that school had been something that mum had discussed from time to time, but until we moved here I never considered that it could become reality.
I was full of hope. And anxiety. I knew nothing of the world beyond these four walls. And whoever this woman was, she was about to unveil it all to me.
“Please take a seat, young lady. Do you happen to know how to make tea?” Belfrost asked.
I said nothing, standing there still in my nightgown and puzzling over whether she was my savior or another demon that had come to punish me further.
My reluctance to speak caused her eyes to sharpen and she made a huff as Jeremy coughed in his hand.
“As you can see madam, we are in desperate need of your services here.”
“Indeed. The girl hardly speaks, and we shall say nothing of her dress and grooming. Does her mother know that she has bled and yet not cleansed her body?”
I opened my mouth to object to why I was treated this way, but Uncle Jeremy’s gaze only further encouraged my silence. If you have ever felt under the thumb of an abuser, I do not need to explain what his warning was telling me.
I was to cooperate fully with his intentions to spare further misery.
“What sort of paperwork will I need to sign?” Jeremy asked.
“Well, as it stands I still need a statement from the mother and then I will need to determine whether or not the girl is even fit for our classes,” Belfrost said as I stepped closer.
“Her mother is under my care and keeping. Her father died long ago. I am her rightful guardian, you needn’t worry about a secondary statement,” Jeremy said.
“No. Mum will hear about this!” I said angrily.
“Silence your tongue when adults speak!” Belfrost said wrapping her cane across my knee.
Instinctively I kicked back and she grabbed my leg, causing me to tumble to the floor.
“You are quite the little viper, aren’t you?” she hissed as she straightened her clothes.
All I did in response was spit on her shoes.
Belfrost gave me a look of repugnance and turned toward Jeremy before making her decision. “You should have come to seek my help sooner. I fear this… child may be too far gone,” she snarled.
Just then mum came in with groceries, perplexed as I was by the scene before her.
“What is going on here?” she said in a whisper.
“Annabelle…. to my office!” Jeremy ordered.
I sat there on the floor, feeling more like a dog that was being cast out then her daughter as she was taken to a private room to discuss my fate.
Madam Belfrost said nothing, her once friendly eyes now turning cold and judgmental.
In a few short moments mum came out and signed the papers. I never knew for sure what she had been told, but I was given an hour to pack my things. It felt like an eternity.
As I did, mum came to check on me from time to time, saying nothing and merely folding clothes and seeming in a trance.
When it was finally time to leave, I was sure that I could find the courage to convince mum not to let me go. But in those final moments, as Madam Belfrost brought her vehicle around and I saw Uncle Jeremy place his firm and unyielding hand upon her shoulder, I said nothing.
“It will only be for a little while. You will be strong for us,” Mum said as she kissed me and then returned to Jeremy’s side.
Uncle only gave the thinnest of smiles, an image that stayed with me for the next few weeks and months to come. It told me of the torment and anguish he intended to inflict upon mum the moment I left.
* * * * * *
It was that smile that kept me going. Because I dreamt of the day that I could wipe it off his smug face.
My arrival at Everstone was with little fanfare. Madam Belfrost gave me a room and a change of clothes with only a few short words and then informed me breakfast and classes were to begin at 8 the next morning.
I crept into bed, ashamed and confused still about why I was here; the girls that shared my dormitory beginning to whisper about it as I lay down.
“You think she was from the streets?” “Look at what she’s wearing.” “Just a little skank!”
“Oi! Girl! What’s your name then?” one taller girl asked, pulling the blankets off my trembling face and pushing me to the floor.
“G-g-Gloria,” I said as I stood up and then took turns laughing at my shoddy clothes.
“Must be one of them homeless wretches that Belfry brings in to make us all look good,” the girl teased as she checked my arms and grunted. “Are you a sewer rat?”
“Leave her alone!” a voice commanded from a bunk a few meters away.
“And what’s she to you, ya little twat? Your new lover?” the tall girl spat back.
The stranger hopped down, her raven black hair melting with the darkness of the night as she met the tall girl’s eyes and dared her to take her on.
“I’d make ya squeal Uncle in under two,” she swore.
“Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!” the other girls chanted.
Then a shuffle of feet made them all retreat to bed. One of the maids stepped in and turned on the lights, chiding all of us for being up at that late hour.
Then the room was quiet again and the tension over.
As the other girls turned in I gave the stranger a nod of thanks. She said nothing and simply turned over and let the darkness cover her.
But it was definitely worth remembering her kindness that night. The first glimmer of hope I’d experienced in quite a while. It’s warmth guided me to sleep.
* * * * * *
Life at the boarding school was in stark contrast to what I knew of home or Jeremy’s estate.
Every morning Madam Belfrost has us set our beds and straighten our linens. Any girl that did not have theirs properly made suffered punishment. I learned rather quickly this game in a variety of forms.
Even on that first morning when I leapt out of bed at the sound of a foghorn, Belfrost made an example of what she deemed was my laziness.
“You must remember that every moment you are being defined by the society around you. You must submit to its will and be molded according to its purpose. This is your prerogative,” she told me as she took out a ruler and used it to wrap on my hand.
“Recite our etiquette!” she demanded of the other girls as she told me to hold my hand out and accept the thrashing.
As the others obediently provided a list of rules that told me all I needed to be aware of to survive here, I was instead forced to focus on the pain and swelling that came from her repeated lashings.
“You would do well to remember everything you hear and to ask all the questions you can. Always raise your hand ad wait your turn. Do not speak unless spoken to. Do not forget that it is a privilege you are here,” Belfrost remarked as she told the girls to all get dressed promptly. She stood there coldly waiting for us to obey.
There were many times that I was naked before Uncle Jeremy or even my mum when we shared a room. But somehow doing it now in front of this callous woman it felt different. Every flinch and motion she made was a part of her critique.
I could not put on my new uniform fast enough. And standing there, being examined like a mannequin on display, felt even more humiliating.
Each morning after we did this, followed by breakfast and writing. There were several teachers at the school, all just as strict as Belfrost and all eager to please her cruel spirit.
“You are most assuredly one of the worst students to grace our halls. Were you even raised at all in society?” she asked one afternoon as I failed to use proper silverware.
Her constant beratement of my senses had nearly reached a boiling point.
“Maybe it is because I prefer to live undecently… mum,” I said, standing up and flipping the tray.
She forced me to pull down my uniform and gave me 10 lashings right there in front of the other girls. Complaining that I didn’t even know proper grammar.
Failing to see that my act of defiance was my choice to try and free my soul. It made me want to run and hide. I didn’t want to be the center of attention anymore. I didn’t think I could survive it.
The times I was not the brunt of their blows, often I would see the stranger instead.
Yet it became clear that her stay here easily eclipsed mine. So why did she continue to fall out of line?
It made little sense to do anything besides submit.
Her behavior toward me was especially vexing.
At night she would often wake me up and force me to spar, preventing what little chance for rest I had. She wouldn’t explain why she treated me like a punching bag except I could tell that she felt like she was training me.
Forcing me to fight back.
“If you ever hope to get out of here, you need to make me fall,” she insisted as she took me the top of the stairs and often wrestled with me to gain control.
When we did collapse to the bottom of the steps, Belfrost or one of the other instructors would come to find us and reprimand us with more lashes. Anything to remind us that we were just there to suffer. To fall in line like good soldiers ought to.
The stranger would often claim she started the fights, which, while true, made me wonder why she kept at it. Why was she still forcing herself to go through this?
Seeing her constantly taking the toll for the rest of us that fell out of line made me question her sanity. Until the day I recognized what she was doing. I wish I could have come to this revelation sooner, but this is not about fairy tales.
We were taking a class in ballet, Madam Belfrost seemed to believe we could get the chance to perform at a local theater soon and I found myself having difficulty keeping posed during the sessions.
As a result, she decided to make me face a new punishment.
“If you cannot behave with an ounce of dignity, then you shall be forced to recognize the price of insolence!” Belfrost said as she snapped me up by my hair and told me to come to her study.
The stranger nearly fell over herself to stop her.
“Milady, please. I feel as though my performance was far more lacking than hers,” she insisted.
“Melody, you foolish girl, you may pride yourself with taking the whipping for all these other girls as their surrogate mother. But this shrew has no excuse for her continued lack of manners! Decency is expected of all of you, and this time you will see that simply acting as a proxy will do no good!” Belfrost fumed as she took me by the hand and stormed out.
As we got to the Madam’s study, I saw some of the other girls stand anxiously to see what would happen. There was a large vanity at the west side of her room, just big enough for a girl of my size to stand in and she ordered me to do so.
“If you refuse to be molded as a lady, then we shall show you what happens when you fail to obey!” Belfrost shouted as she locked the door to the case.
What followed were the worst 15 minutes of my life.
Belfrost proceeded to turn the vanity into an Iron Maiden, with me as the pincushion. Slowly she pressed in the knitting needles she often carried in her hair straight through empty slots in the vanity, their sharp points forcing me to stand up straight, to suck my gut in.
I felt like I was slowly suffocating, the needles pressing against my tender brutalized skin as I squealed and cried.
I wanted to scream. I wanted to scratch my way out of that coffin as she kept placing more needles into me, forcing blood to drip from every pore.
“Do you see now, whelp? Your place is simply to be seen and never heard. This is what society has in store for you! Once you accept it, you will live a happy existence,” Belfrost snarled.
I closed my eyes, praying to any god that might listen, for it to stop.
But it was the stranger that saved me that day.
Just as another needle was pressed straight against my neck, I heard a cry of surprise come from the madam and then sounds of a struggle.
Something large shattered and broke as she spit violent words to whoever was attacking her. In the ruckus, a few needles were pressed harder against my body, making my own wails match Belfrost’s as the struggle continued.
Then suddenly the room was dead quiet. I heard a final scream and gurgle from Belfrost and then the door to the vanity opened and I fell over, quivering as the needles inflicted more damage. I was a shaking mess of blood and pain as I struggled to open my eyes and comprehend what happened.
The first thing I saw was Belfrost’s widened eyes, a knitting needle stuck straight through the back of her skull and splitting her nose and mouth straight down the middle. A slow trickle of blood was dangling from her mangled corpse as I looked up and saw Melody standing there, a disheveled mess.
“You… you killed her!” I said in disbelief as she climbed over Belfrost and helped me up. I was paralyzed by the needles, hardly able to even feel my legs.
“You need to run,” she told me as she helped me to stand and slowly pulled the needles from my skin. I wasn’t sure which felt worse, having them inside my body, or that slow sickening feeling of having them taken out.
A few other girls came into the room, chattering away in disbelief about what had happened to Belfrost as a few of the other instructors came to see what the commotion was about.
“My lord!” a housekeeper screamed as she saw my naked form standing over Belfrost’s corpse.
“The wench killed the Madam!” another shouted in shock as I was pulled up.
Melody used her bare teeth to snap at the housekeeper’s arm, pushing me away and shouting, “Don’t make what I did be for nothing! Run while you still have a chance!”
I understood in that moment the many times she had taken lashes for others was out of a kinship for our suffering. She wanted to become our guardian. And for that, I respected and envied her.
I took her advice in that moment and fled, naked and afraid toward the window. Sliding down a drainpipe to the gardens below, I felt like some feral animal attempting to escape containment.
More shouts and alarms came from all corners of the school as I hid in a creek, catching my breath and feeling the residual pain of the needles coarse through my body.
I saw in the window above the other instructors were grabbing Melody, forcing her to her room as she fought even more wildly.
One day I would come back and thank her properly.
But for now, my only purpose was revenge.
* * * * * *
Finding and nursing my wounds came first. Using clothes I stole from the nearby laundry, I fled to the woods and nursed my punctured skin. Thankfully the blood loss wasn’t great enough to consider medical treatment. All it really had done was transform me into a numb machine.
Maybe that was for the best though, considering what I was setting out to do.
My focus was to take what Melody had taught me and to sharpen in. Find a way to liberate my mum and let us have a life we deserved.
I practiced wrestling, got a class in boxing and learned to fire a gun properly. I wanted this to be the final nail in my Uncle’s coffin.
I knew the only way that would work is if I killed Uncle Jeremy.
No decent woman of my caliber should ever consider such trappings. But by now in life, through the hardship and the pain, I was going to make sure I lived up to the statement I gave Belfrost months ago.
I would be the opposite of what any civilized lady was expected. I would be the fury that brought justice to my uncle.
* * * * * *
One thing Melody taught me above all else was to exert patience. I needed to train myself to learn and watch Jeremy and his patterns.
I realized it wouldn’t be enough to simply take his life. That would be far too easy for a man that had tortured me all his life.
Instead, I needed to learn what he did care about. And then simply apply pressure.
It took precisely fourteen weeks. I became a part of their lives, a stranger.
I rented a small cabin across the way, just far enough to get surveillance on them. Hack into their internet. Modern deceptions that would allow me to understand their every move.
My mum never saw me of course. That would have given away my plan all too easily. But I watched her too. The endless inane chores she did to satisfy his every whim. Following her every day into town, or watching as she catered to him at home. It made my stomach churn.
He took pleasure in seeing her work and profiting from her labors. With my presence no longer a factor, though, I could see mum was not simply putting up with his foolishness. She wanted out.
Each time she went to the market, she would consider staying. Or in the evening, hitching a cab and leaving Sussex altogether.
Jeremy on the other hand was the very epitome of laziness and the definition of a slob.
I could tell that he cared for money so that was where I attacked first. He would fritter it away nightly at the casinos. So I burned them down.
It likely caused a few honest people to lose their livelihood in the process but I was beyond caring by that point. All that mattered was the end result.
Next were his spirits. The wines and beers he would often turn to before he lashed out to mum.
I kept a record of every store he went to, every merchant he rubbed elbows with.
I threatened them all. Walking into the store with my sharpened blade likely made me look like a bandit from olden days. But the message stuck. They all agreed to never contribute to his bad habits again.
As I continued to monitor Jeremy, and take away the fun and games he wasted his days on, I saw his mood change.
One day while they were both gone I installed listening devices to hear what my Uncle might be planning.
I knew something was wrong when he began inviting strange men to the home. They reminded me of the media portrayals of mafia gangsters. Slick and deceptive. Slimy and conniving.
“You’re over three weeks late on your payments, Jer. The Gravemaker is an understanding man but this is beyond our control. Either you pay, or we find a different way to collect,” the first man said.
I had never seen my Uncle frightened. It pleased me briefly to see that these men were doing that. But I also recognized what they were representing.
I realized if I didn’t act soon, he would likely take mum’s life simply for being unable to control his gambling. Profit off her life insurance.
I had to act that night to save my mum once and for all.
* * * * * *
To think that the moment I planned so gracefully for months was thrust upon me in an instant didn’t seem fair. But then when has my life ever been?
I waited until they were both home and properly in bed. I figured one slice to the throat would be all it would take.
I climbed the outside of their estate like any typical burglar, my toned body no longer the frail girl he once often took down.
Instead, I was a vigilante here with a purpose. I took out my blade and slid open their second-floor patio, stepping gingerly into the bedroom like a ghost might.
As I stood over the bed and saw my mum shiver with her back turned to Jeremy it made me even more furious. Even her rest could not be free of his torment.
And though I wished to take his life swiftly, having come so far to make him fall so gracefully… I knew I was going to take my time with this.
I placed the blade at his throat, taking in the scent that had plagued me for ages one last time.
Then I covered his mouth with the chloroform clothe I had brought, safely keeping him from awakening in a flash to my arrival.
I did the same to mum, although I was far more gentle with her. She need not be aware of the carnage this night would be filled with.
Then I took my uncle and dragged him to the first floor, his body as limp as a doll. I placed him tied and bound to a chair and quickly found a few sharp needles to awaken him. They reminded me of Belfrost and all the ways she had tortured me. To think that I now used the same methods disturbed me. But only for a moment.
Seeing my Uncle’s eyes widen in alarm as the thin needles from mum’s pin cushion slid under his fingernails was enough to make me cackle with glee.
“Gloria?” he asked in disbelief. He tried for a moment to scream for help from mum but I quickly shook my head and remarked, “No one is here to save you.”
In those few short words, my Uncle seemed to understand my purpose being there.
“You’ve come to kill me?” he guessed, shaking his head and spitting at the floor. “I suppose this is what those letters from that fucking school were about? You were expelled, eh? What a riot. Couldn’t even be properly trained there. You’re just a fuckin’ animal, aren’t you?” he spat back.
I positioned the blade I had meticulously carved beneath his lips and warned, “You will show respect or I will make you eat your words.”
“And why should I? Because you will torture me? Show me my place. Wake up, girl. You have become nothing more than the monster you wanted to escape!”
As he laughed madly I lost my own temper and plunged the blade into his chest, twisting it sharply.
This only made his laughter turn to madness, his eyes dazzling as he looked at me.
“Is that all you’ve got? You are pathetic, truly. Just kill me and be done with it,” he urged me.
I spat in his face and took the blade out, ready to riddle him with more wounds. But no, he would not gain control over my victory. This was going to take all night.
“You think you know pain because of what you inflicted on me. But you’re wrong. You’re no longer the monster here. I am. And by the time I am done with you, you will be begging for death,” I sneered in his face.
He only smiled and shook his head.
“Prove it,” he challenged and then added an interesting proposal. “Untie me. No weapons. No advantages. We will see just what sort of animal you have become.”
I looked at his bruised hands, his bloody waist. I knew he was goading me into a fight.
But it felt worth it.
“I will make one thing clear to you. There is no point to any of this unless only one of us walks away. And it will not be you.”
I cut the bounds and flipped his chair up, urging my Uncle to his feet the same way he had all those years ago.
As he stood up, his calm demeanor receded in mere seconds. Grabbing at my ankles, he tugged me down to the carpet and lunged for my face, pressing his fingers toward my eyes.
“Filthy bitch! We should have sent you off to a foreign school!” he snarled.
I kicked him hard in the crotch, yelling as I used all of my strength to push him away and began to beat him like the worthless pulp that he was.
But Jeremy was a fighter. With every ounce of his energy, he fought back and tossed debris at my face, scolding me with his words as he frantically searched for an upper hand.
“You’ve dreamt of this moment, haven’t you? How miserable your life will be once I am gone!” he chided me.
“I look forward to it!” was the only response I dared to dignify him with.
For several minutes we wrestled upon the stairs and patio, each of us trying to gain the upper hand.
At last, I pushed his skull against the banister and into the glass of the garden patio, shattering it in the process. Victory in my grasp, I held him over the edge of the balcony and snarled, “Give me one good reason why I should not end you here and now.”
His laughter and defiance were gone now. Only a look of… I think, pity, remained.
“Do you really think any words I offered to you would suffice, Gloria? There are some things in this world that just cannot be fixed. I am one of them. So go on then, finish it!” he spat back.
I wrapped my fingers around his throat, eager to do him in.
“You deserve so much more than this!” I said angrily, pushing him back onto the carpeted floor, frustrated that he still defiantly refused to fear what I had become.
“And you as well, my dear. We are not so different, you and I. Except that I recognize that there is no turning back. Embrace it. Revel in what I have made you become!” he cackled.
Was this a game to him? A moment to treasure? Did he think even now that he held sway over me?
I lost all recollection of thought in those next few instances. I leapt onto him like a cat, using my bare fingernails to scrape at his face. My rage engulfed all my senses.
For the first time, I was the one that made him scream. Like Melody had shown me, I used my bare teeth and plucked his left eye from his skull. In unbridled pain and desperation he fumed, his shrieks echoing throughout the room.
Once it was free from his body, I forced his mouth open and shoved the dangling orb down his throat alongside his sinew and nerves. I pressed my knife against his throat, forcing him to chew.
“I am going to carve you up, little by little, until you realize that you are nothing but trash. You are beneath it. You are the scum of this earth. And no punishment I give would suffice to make you properly pay for what you have done!” I screamed.
His body quivered, and he moaned as I forced my knife into his side again and again, until my hand had gone numb from plunging it into his gut.
Then I stumbled back and beheld this pathetic excuse for a man, and shouted, “Say it! Say you are worthless! Admit to your useless excuse of a life!”
He was crying, hardly able to breathe. He couldn’t even get two words out.
But in those last few moments of his life were a show of defiance, of pity. Treating me like a victim to the last.
Then, to my stunned amazement, the sound of a gun ripped through the air. Two bullets found their way straight into his skull, no different than those my father had likely used to take his own life. Though, this time, they served a completely different purpose.
I turned to the stairs to see mum standing there, holding Jeremy’s firearm and shaking.
“You… have no idea… how long I have wanted to do that…” she said as Jeremy fell to the floor, gurgling on blood.
I collapsed in her arms in a ball of tears.
The wails of death and of our reunion resounded throughout the night.
* * * * * *
There is little else to tell save for the fact that mum did remarry a preacher from Manchester. Surprisingly she insisted on a service for Jeremy, though we opted to cast his corpse to the bottom of the sea rather than bury him alongside our kin in the family cemetery.
I was given the rest of my father’s money on my eighteenth birthday two years after the ordeal, and used it to purchase the Everstone School.
I resolved to teach the girls there self-defense and survival skills, rather than manners. The world suffers from no lack of decency, I think. But as for forces of nature, such as me and my mysterious savior, the sort that cannot be stopped… we are few and far between.
I made a plaque to honor my strange friend, who first inspired me to stand up for myself. I never saw her again, nor could I confirm whether or not she was still alive. I remain hopeful she is, however, as every now and then I hear word of others having been saved from abuse the same way I was. The rumors give me hope that she is continuing to teach others to resist, and to behave in a way that can only be considered… undecent."	9.55	11.0	Kyle Harrison	06/17/2020
Children’s Games	"“How much longer till we reach the campsite?”
Archer pursed his lips as he thought. “I dunno, maybe another hour, maybe two…” He immediately stopped the joke when he saw how all three of his companions, including me, were giving him the evil eye. “I’m kidding! Oh my god, guys, it’s like ten more minutes and we’ll be there.”
Charlotte made a few quick steps to catch up with our leader and punched him on the shoulder. “Sun’s going down soon, idiot. If you’re underestimating the amount of time it’ll take to get there, we’ll be setting up our tent in the dark, and Sage is probably going to step on a possum again.”
“I didn’t step on the possum, I almost stepped on the possum. There’s a difference,” I said, kicking a rock and watching it bounce off the back of Archer’s boot.
The final member of our party, Joey, snickered at the memory. “I dunno, you might’ve stepped on its tail. Like, not put your full weight on it, but I definitely heard that oversized rodent squeak. Seriously though, Archer, what’s the big deal about camping in this particular spot? I have seen more than three spots that were good enough.”
“Good enough, Joey, but not perfect,” Archer said, flashing his grin back at us. “You’ll understand when we wake up in the morning. And possums aren’t rodents, they’re marsupials.”
I just rolled my eyes, adjusted my backpack, and tried to keep up with my taller friends.
To Archer’s credit, it was just under ten minutes that we reached the spot. He crowed with delight and put on an extra burst of speed, skidding to a stop in the middle of the small clearing. “Here we are! Girls, set up the tents. Joey, help me get the fire going. Who wants hobo pies for dinner?”
“Did we remember pizza sauce?” I asked as I plopped my pack onto the ground, groaning with relief when I cracked my shoulders. I knew I was going to feel that in the morning. “And cheese?”
“In the cooler,” Joey said as he set it down. “Did we bring the irons?”
Charlotte nodded. “Just two though, since last time someone left one in the fire for too long and it melted,” she said, giving me a knowing look. I didn’t even bother to protest; that one really was on me. I still needed to replace it, but I barely had enough money to pitch in for gas this trip, so replacing the pie iron was out of the question.
Like we always did, we fell into our roles of setting up camp, and before long camp was all set up. Everyone was sitting around the fire laughing. Charlotte was behind me, rubbing my sore shoulders as Joey was ripping open the bag of marshmallows. “Who wants me to make them a s’more?” he asked.
I put up both hands in the air. Joey could make the best marshmallows… nice golden brown crunch on the outside, warm and gooey in the middle. Archer busted out the pie makers and filled the inside of his with blueberry pie filling.
It was so peaceful out here, but I was still confused. “Why this exact spot, Archer?” I asked as he stuck his pie maker in the coals.
“Like I said, you’ll see in the morning. The sunrise is beautiful from up here. Besides, no one else hikes out this far in the woods, so we won’t have a repeat of the drunks like the last time we did this.” Archer winced as the memory returned to the forefront of his mind. “No one blasting music, no one hitting on either of you, and just generally no one bothering us while we blow off steam.”
Joey grinned and snaked a flashlight out from his bag. “And best of all, no one to hear your screams!” He cackled, flicking the flashlight on under his chin at an attempt to appear ghastly in the dark. Not one of us was impressed, and Charlotte even rolled her eyes.
“Cut it out, Joey. We aren’t in high school anymore. Your scary stories aren’t gonna work on us anymore,” she said.
Joey pouted and the flashlight clicked off. “Come on, just one more? For old time’s sake? Before Sage leaves us to go to college?” he asked.
Low blow, but it definitely worked on me. I swallowed before saying, “Come on. Let him tell his scary stories, guys.”
Joey grinned and speared two marshmallows onto the metal stick. “All right, let us begin. With a story that happened in these… very… woods.”
“I think you’ve already told us this one,” Archer interrupted.
Joey ignored him and continued telling his story in that dramatized tone I’d grown to love and hate over the years, all while turning his pair of marshmallows over the flickering flames.
“In these woods, there is a demon. A demon as old as time, evil and who gets off on torturing innocent humans. He waits until there are some innocent victims, unaware of the history of these woods, to come in so he can play with them. He’ll appear in the shadows, out of the corner of your eye, amping your paranoia until he finally appears. It’s said he’s so awful to look at, you’ll lose your mind the moment you look at him. His claws are a foot long, and he’ll use them to rip your stomach open and send your guts everywhere. But his favorite way to kill humans is to impale them on sharp branches, letting you slowly bleed out onto the ground. It’s said he likes it so much because that’s the only way you’ll ever be rid of him… You must impale him through the heart.”
As if he timed it, I heard a branch snap behind me and I screamed, spinning around just in time to see a deer bound off into the trees. I turned back around, face bright red as my friends howled in hysterics at me.
“Very funny, guys. Can I have my damn s’more now?” I asked.
Joey pulled the stick out of the fire and nodded. “They look just about right, give me a second and I’ll get you your s’more.” In just a minute he had it all whipped up, marshmallow and chocolate bar sandwiched between graham crackers. I ate my s’more and all was forgiven and forgotten… for the most part.
The moon inched up the sky and we were already caught up in our typical shenanigans, playing Uno, drinking a few light beers, and finishing off over half the bag of marshmallows by way of s’mores. It was after beer four or five that I got up and went off to take a leak. Stumbling through the brush, I got far enough away from camp to do my business… far enough that my friend’s chatter was nothing but white noise.
I had just zipped my pants up when the sound stopped.
A forest is never quiet. Not really. Crickets chirp, frogs croak, the wind rustles the leaves, but it’s never quiet. It was like someone hit the mute button on the woods. I couldn’t even hear my friends talking to one another.
“Guys?” I stumbled through the dark, heading right for the campfire I could see through the brush. “You good? Hello?”
I entered the campsite… and I was the only one there.
I kicked the lone hobo pie maker out of the flames, turning my head all around to see where they’d gone. “You’re hilarious. Come on, I got spooked enough by Joey’s shit story, come out or I’m walking back to the car.” A lie; it’d taken hours to get out here and I wasn’t stupid enough to walk in the woods alone at night. “Guys?”
I unzipped my tent and poked my head inside, expecting to see Charlotte ready to jump out and shout ‘Boo!’ But the sleeping bags weren’t even unrolled. Frowning, I backed out and glanced around. “Guys? Did something happen? Charlotte? Archer? Okay, Joey, this stopped being funny, come out!”
Archer’s scream of terror made me jump nearly half a foot in the air. I nearly stumbled back into the fire. I whipped around to see dozens of sparks fly out from the logs, and then, through the smoke, I saw it. A black shape, hunched over by the treeline. It cocked its head to the side before waving a hand in the air. A hand with foot-long claws.
I couldn’t move. I was frozen as the creature ambled up to me on all fours, its claws raking through the ground as it approached. I finally took a step back and that’s when it pounced. Like a jungle cat, it flew through the air and I barely sidestepped in time to avoid getting stabbed in the chest. One of its claws raked down my arm and I screamed in pain. The monster laughed, showing off a mouthful of needle-pointed teeth.
I ran. I bolted straight for the woods and ran as fast as I could. In the dark I couldn’t see a foot in front of me, I stumbled through bushes and thorns scraped against my legs. I tripped and fell on the ground, and when I got up there was Joey.
“Oh my god, Sage! You’re okay!” Joey helped me up off the ground. “Jesus Christ, you nearly ran off a cliff.” I took a look behind Joey and sure enough, just a few more steps and I would’ve tumbled down a steep incline.
“I thought,” I gasped, “I thought your story was just another stupid thing you made up.”
“It was!” Joey ran his hands through his hair, making it stand straight up. “It’s just one of those stories I used to tell you guys when we were kids, after it got dark. But then after you left, I blinked and everyone was gone, except… except there was that thing. The monster.”
I spun around to look for it. “I think I outran it, so we’re good,” I turned back around and realized I was talking to nothing. The only sign Joey had ever been there was the dropped flashlight on the ground.
“… Joey?” I scooped the flashlight up and shone it around. “Joey, where did you go?”
Another turn and there it was again. The monster. It waved its now bloody claws at me, its mouthful of needle teeth grinning like a macabre Jack O’ Lantern.
I couldn’t breathe. I stepped back once and it bolted me again. I screamed, raised the flashlight in the air, and brought it down right on the top of the monster’s head. It made the most hideous crack as the beam of light flickered before going dark. The monster stumbled back one too many steps and fell right off the cliff.
I didn’t stick around for it to get back up. I bolted back into the woods. Where the monster had slashed me earlier ached like nothing else but I needed to find someone else. I needed to find the others, get bandaged up, and then get the hell out of here.
“Joey! Charlotte! Archer!? Where are you!? If you hear me, scream as loud as you can!”
Deathly silence. The desire to break down and just cry was getting stronger but I needed someone, anyone… and not the monster, whose breathing alerted me to its return.
I whipped around and there it was, snarling and growling.
“Please! Why can’t you just leave me and my friends alone?” I asked.
I swore the thing laughed as it took a step towards me. And then it spoke, in this hideous, raspy voice.
“I already got them. Come here, Sage… I’m going to eat you next.”
I screamed again before I pitched the flashlight right at that thing’s shadowy head. It grunted as it made contact, backing away as one of its clawed hands reached up to touch the injury. Something fell from its other hand and I managed to scoop it up. My stomach twisted as I recognized it as Archer’s hunting knife. Then I saw red.
Then with a scream, I charged the monster. It wasn’t going to get me; I wasn’t going to die tonight. I buried the knife right in the monster’s shoulder, its scream of agony and the spray of blackish-gray fluid splattering across my face just fueling me further.  I pulled the knife out and stabbed it again.  I brought that knife down again and again, screaming at the top of my lungs and not stopping until it lay limply on the ground.
I dropped the knife when the monster was finally dead, took a step back, and then blacked out.
I woke up the next morning next to the campsite, having no idea how I got there. My arm was killing me. My throat felt all sorts of fucked up from all the screaming. And I was still covered in that thing’s blood.
I just wanted to go home.
I stumbled woozily to my feet, nearly stumbling into the fire pit as I made my way to the tent. It took three tries for my shaky fingers to undo the zipper. I stepped inside and there was Charlotte, crouched in the corner, eyes wide with fear and clutching onto her bloody pocketknife.
“Get back! Get away from me!” she screeched, swiping the knife at me. I fell back on my ass, barely dodging the desperate swipes.
“Christ! Charlotte, it’s me! I’m okay!” I held up both my hands. “I’m okay! The monster’s dead! I killed it!”
Charlotte blinked a few times to clear her eyes before the knife slipped from her fingers. “You’re not… you’re not one of them… Oh my god, Sage, what happened to you? Why are you covered in blood?”
“It’s not mine.” I offered my hand to her. “Come on, let’s get out of here. We’ll go get some help, and they’ll find the guys, okay?”
Charlotte sniffled before picking her knife back up and taking my offered hand with her free one. Together we stumbled out of the tent while I was doing my best not to grimace about my arm. “Did you get the monster too?” I asked, gesturing to her knife.
“I think so… managed to make it go away at least–” Charlotte came to a stop. “Wait! Listen!”
I did stop and I did listen. And I heard the quietest cry for help.
“Joey!”
We both bounded off into the woods, in our rush I nearly ended up tumbling down that cliff again, but Charlotte managed to grab the back of my shirt and yank me back from the edge just in time. I glanced over and saw Joey. Charlotte gasped and I heard her start to cry.
Joey was slumped up against a stump, clinging onto his awkwardly bent leg. I nearly threw up when I realized there was no way a leg could normally bend that way. “Guys!” he waved up at us. “You found me! Help me out of here!”
As carefully as possible I managed to slide down to his level. “What happened?” I asked.
“Monster pushed me over,” he hissed in pain as I managed to help him up. I tried not to stare at his fucked up leg, but it was hard not to. “Just… just be my crutch and we can get out of here. Where did you go last night? We were talking and you were just gone.”
“I was gone?” I held Joey up as he hopped on his good leg. “What about you? I turned around, and instead of you, there was the monster.”
We limped up the less steep side of the cliff, where Charlotte was standing. She went to Joey’s other side and helped support him from there. “We just need to get out of here,” she said. “We just need to go get back to the parking lot and call for help.”
The three of us hobbled through the woods. Joey’s face was all sorts of screwed up with pain, but he just gritted his teeth and let us help him back to the campsite.
I helped Joey to a comfortable position on the ground and got back up. “Okay, just to the parking lot. I’ll go. Charlotte, you can wait here with Joey–”
I didn’t get to finish that sentence before a body dropped down right on the fire pit.
I screamed as it crashed down next to me. I jumped away and Charlotte almost darted off back into the woods before Joey shouted, “Archer!”
It was Archer. His dead eyes stared back up at me, his chest filled with stab wounds.
The knife came down next, clattering off of a stone before coming to rest next to my feet. Then the laughter came.
We all looked up to see a trio of… children. Children, no older than nine or ten, sitting up in the tree and laughing their heads off like they’d just pulled off the greatest of pranks. “It worked! You should’ve seen your faces!” the oldest boy called down to us.
“What the fuck?!” Joey made a move to get up but just plopped back down, tears sprouting from the corners of his eyes. “What did you do to Archer!?”
The only girl had the most malicious stare as she grinned and said, “What did we do? We didn’t do a thing, ‘cept had some fun. You were the ones that took it too far, even if it was really, really funny.”
“The monster did this to him,” I said, crawling over to Archer’s side. “The monster killed him.”
The final one, the littlest boy, shook his head solemnly. “Nope. You’re the monsters, and you always were,” he said.
I glanced down at my hands and realized that the blood was no longer black. It was red. Red and dry. It was never black.
My chest went tight as I looked over at my friends, Charlotte staring at her pocketknife while Joey looked at me in horror.
“It’s… it’s not true,” I laughed nervously. “I killed the monster. I killed it with Archer’s…” I trailed off as I looked down at the knife at my feet. “I killed it with Archer’s knife.”
The children’s laughter was now bordering on hysteria as I sunk to the ground, my chest growing too tight to breathe. I looked up to watch the children vanish, one by one, until only the smallest was left. He grinned, and for a second all I saw was the shadowy monster that had chased me through the night. Then he was just a little boy… and then he was gone."	9.8	15.0	Kitty “The Odd Cat Lady” Olsen	06/16/2020
Teke Teke	"The boy hated the nights when his big brother snuck out. He would stare at the empty bed in the bedroom they shared, under the large open window in the eave. Through there, every now and again, he could hear the unmistakable metal thuds of the passing trains – rumbling teke-teKE, teke-TEKE, teKE-TEKE, TEKE-TEKE across the yard and over the fence.
He normally hated the grinding, gnashing pulse of the metal monsters racing past his bedroom window.
But there was one that he liked.
The 11:18. The last train. The train that the boy’s father said was full of drunken businessmen going home. The boy did not yet know what “drunk” was, but he understood the disapproving sigh his mother would let out at the suggestion.
The boy didn’t care about the businessmen, with their untucked shirts and angry wives. He just knew that the 11:18 was the signal for his brother to come home after he’d snuck out to see the pretty girl who lived across the tracks. He’d only seen her once before, and he didn’t really understand. She had two eyes, like all the other girls. She had long black hair, like all the other girls. She wore the same school shirt that he and his brother wore, with the same school crest emblazoned on the chest.
His brother would just ruffle his hair and tell him that he’d understand one day.
Teke-teke…
The distant signature of the 11:18 echoed across the room.
Teke-teKE…
He would be saying his goodbyes and getting ready to sneak out of the girl’s window.
Teke-TEKE… 
The boy wondered if they’d kissed. He’d seen that in a movie his big brother had left on the TV once.
TeKE-TEKE…
He listened for the final, loud boom as the train raced past and gave way for his brother’s path home.
But tonight, there was a small pause. Infinitesimal. So small you’d never even notice if you hadn’t heard the same sound every night for months.
The boy would eventually understand that tiny pause, but for now, all he heard was the blaring roar of the train’s horn coupled with the grinding screech of the metal brakes. Angry shadows danced across the wall as the train pulled to a screaming halt.
The drunken businessmen were home much later to their angry wives than expected.
But the boy’s brother didn’t come home at all.
In the weeks that followed, the boy was told what had happened to his brother, even though he didn’t really understand. He just knew that the girl with the long black hair didn’t walk like she used to. Before she had been straight-backed, laughing and twirling, hiding her smiles behind her hands. Now she simply walked with her shoulders hunched and that long black hair covering her face.
By the time the boy came to truly understand what had happened, more than a few years had passed. His legs were stronger, his back was broader, and little hairs had sprouted in brand new places. He also stopped walking to school alone, instead choosing to walk with a girl from down the road.
There was something about her that he could not place. She had eyes, but hers weren’t like those of the other girls. They were a deep brown, and looking into them felt like falling into a pile of autumn leaves. She had long black hair that fell straight like a sheer veil over her slender shoulders. And she wore the same school shirt that he wore, that his brother had worn; only now the way the school crest rested upon her chest and rose and fell with her breaths was unfathomably enticing.
And they walked and joked and talked, and they sometimes brushed hands in a way that he found impossible to ignore.
Once, while walking home from school in early spring, they were caught in a sudden rain shower. Neither had brought an umbrella, so they held hands and dashed through the streets until they reached a covered area of vending machines. There, they laughed and shivered and drank hot coffees from the machine until at last their attraction became irresistible, and they kissed.
There, under that canopy, the girl asked, “Will you see me tonight?”
“Of course,” replied the boy. And they embraced again.
That evening, he paced his room thinking of all the witty things he could say to endear himself to her. He looked at the clock. 7:37. It was still too early. It was only a twenty-minute walk to the girl’s house, even factoring in the fifteen-minute detour to the rail bridge down the way, and her parents were not leaving for the movies until 8:00. So long as he beat the 11:18 home, he reasoned, the whole tryst would remain a secret.
He continued his pacing. His feet pounding a regular beat on the hardwood floor.
Te…ke….te….ke….te…ke…
When 8:00 rolled around, he carefully snuck downstairs and turned the key in the back door, where it made a satisfyingly heavy “te-KE” clunk.
Forging his way across the back yard, he approached the back fence. He stared out into the fading light and saw the grass give way to stone, upon which lay two long, sturdy rail tracks.
He looked and looked and looked again. Then, once more, he looked. He took a deep breath, thrust his fists downwards, and walked toward the bridge that crossed the tracks further down the way.
A back screen door quietly slid open, with only a faint hiss as it glided into place. Once inside, he embraced the girl and kissed her awkwardly on the cheek. Neither of them dared say what they were thinking, hoping to make their intentions less obvious. She just smiled and brushed her long black hair behind her ears. Enamored by her beauty, he found himself at a loss for words, unable to utter a single clever line.
Eventually, they settled on a film to watch, and he gingerly slid an arm around her delicate shoulders. She nuzzled into him as far as she dared. He wanted to kiss the top of her head, but resisted the temptation, despite her advances.
TE-KE.
A key in the door!
“Could it be so late already?” the boy thought. Jumping from the couch, he barrelled toward the still-open back door and sprinted across the backyard. He ran up the road and toward the hill on which the train tracks lay.
He peered into the dark toward the bridge. So close, but still so far. There wasn’t time if he wished to return undetected.
He mounted the hill and inspected his surroundings. Then he looked and looked again. The night was silent and the tracks bathed in shadow.
It was 11:10. He had eight minutes to travel ten feet, and it still felt like there wasn’t time. The inches had become miles, the seconds hours.
He took a step between the rails of the track.
Te-ke.
He froze, twisting his neck towards the approaching train so fast that his joints cracked.
But there was no approaching train. The night was still as quiet and tranquil as it had always been. There were no lights to be seen, no tell-tale sonorous clangs coming from the rails. The drunken businessmen were not yet reunited with their angry wives.
Te-ke.
The familiar sound danced faintly over the frigid evening air.
But still there was no train.
Te-Ke.
The boy strained to see into the distance, trying to locate the source of the sound. There was no train, but there was a… shape.
Some distance away a man was on the tracks, close enough to make out the dark curves of his shoulders.
No, not a man. Half a man. He seemed planted from the belly up, as though someone was trying to grow the foulest of trees. The man’s hands gripped the rails, holding his mutilated body upright.
The buried man put a hand forward – TE – then the other –KE – to advance in the boy’s direction.
No, not buried. Bottomless. The man’s torso terminated at the navel, his lower half concealed beneath the tattered remains of a ragged shirt and dark stains.
The half-man lurched forward again.
Te-ke.
And again.
Te-Ke.
Soon, like a foal learning to walk, the half-man found a rhythm with which to charge forward.
TE-KE-TE-KE-TE-KE-TE-KE.
Watching the half-man race down the tracks to his awful “Te-Ke” beat, the boy did not notice the time.
11:17.
Nor did he notice the lights.
Full beams.
Nor did he notice the sound.
Screeching. Roaring. Blaring.
He remained frozen to the spot as the abomination halved the distance between them. He did not see the 11:18 full of drunken businessmen.
But he did see the long, curved thing that the half-man produced from behind his back.
And he saw the half-man swing.
And just for a second, he saw a flash of the pattern on his assailant’s shirt.
A crest.
And then, finally, he felt the impact in his side.
Te-KE.
Through the confusion of his fall he looked back toward the track, and saw the half-man engulfed in the blur of the screeching train. Soon, the darkness of the night took him away.
* * * * * *
When the boy awoke, the 11:18 was long since passed. The drunken businessmen were being scolded by their angry wives. His back ached where the half-man’s stick had knocked him from the tracks.
He arose, slowly, and limped back home, knowing that tomorrow the girl would still smile and hide her giggles behind her hands.
From then on the boy vowed to always take the bridge, and thanked his brother for teaching him one final, hair-raising lesson."	8.83	18.0	Kevin Thomas	06/12/2020
A Diner Open 25 Hours a Day	"Late one night, I found myself driving down what seemed like an endless stretch of road. I was on my way back from a week-long business trip, facing at least a twelve-hour drive home. Having always been afraid of flying, the monotonous trek was unavoidable. Though tedious and sometimes downright soul-crushing, I’d grown used to the lonely road trips back and forth from state to state.
In an effort to minimize my commute, I usually refrained from making pit stops. I would push through exhaustion and discomfort, making my way home in one fell swoop. I would then enter my bedroom and meet my blankets with a hard thud, falling asleep almost immediately after my head hit the pillow. Picturing my eventual slumber is what kept my foot on the gas pedal.
On this drive, however, I grew particularly hungry. I tried to ignore the feeling, but this became increasingly difficult as the night went on. I found myself longing for sustenance, fantasizing about dreadful gas station food – anything that would placate my insatiable, late-night hunger. I was between a rock and a hard place, as tightly squished as one could be.
Unable to fight off the urge to eat any longer, I gave in to my stomach’s groaning and got off the highway somewhere in Massachusetts. I had been to the state on several occasions, but this time I was in unfamiliar territory. There were many trees – more than the average cape-side town. On top of that, there were no buildings in sight. Despite the lack of residential growth, I was sure I could sniff out a 7-11 and indulge in a microwave burrito or a slice of rubbery pizza.
I drove on for what must have been thirty minutes or so. No gas stations, no fast food joints, no buildings of any kind. Just miles and miles of wooded area. Worst of all, I didn’t even have a phone signal to pull up my GPS. I was just about to give up on “Operation: Midnight Snack” when I saw a faint glow off in the distance. This signaled to me that I must have been reaching the outskirts of civilization – furthermore, it meant nourishment was just around the corner.
As I approached the glimmering light, I realized it was that of a large, neon sign. Coming closer, I was able to make out what it said; “Supernova Diner,” followed by an even larger subheading; “Open 25 Hours a Day”. I guessed that they really wanted to drive the “we never close” angle home, and in a cheeky manner no less. Cheekier and larger still, there was a big flashing arrow beneath the sign, pointing to the diner in question.
Hungry as ever, I pulled in without hesitation. I jumped out of my car and rushed towards the entrance, but not before taking a quick look at the place. It was a beautiful, retro-themed, silver, box-car diner. The smooth metal exterior gleamed in the moonlight as I walked up. It was so sleek and well-crafted that I wondered why it was located in the middle of nowhere. Could they really get by on the odd passerby here and there?
After admiring the diner’s craftsmanship, I barged in, intent on satisfying my late-night case of the munchies. The diner was void of life, but I heard a voice yell out from the kitchen.
“Be right there!”
While I waited for service, I surveyed my surroundings. A gorgeous, red checkerboard pattern painted the interior of the building. Lining the perimeter were red booths and tables so immaculate, they looked as though they’d never been touched by human hands. To top it all off, there was a row of similarly red, identical, cushioned bar stools at the counter. The diner definitely had a classic, 50s vibe to it, but it was too crisp and clean to feel truly authentic.
After a few minutes of waiting, a middle-aged man came out from the kitchen, drying his hands with a dishrag.
“Hello there! Welcome to the Supernova Diner. My name is Hank, and I’ll be your server, tonight. How can I help you?”
Hank wore a retro, soda jerk cap, a comically large bowtie, a spotless white apron, and a smile almost too wide for his face. He pointed up at the large menu on the wall behind him where I noticed quirky food items like the “Milky Way Shake,” “Galaxy Sliders,” and “Planet Fries.”
“Yeah, I’ll have whatever the special is.”
I didn’t feel like asking him to translate the menu for me, plus I didn’t really care what I was eating so long as my stomach stopped growling.
“The Nebula Express, coming right up!”
Hank shot me another awkwardly wide smile. To escape his eager glare, I pulled out my phone and glanced at the screen. Still no signal, but I noticed that it was approaching midnight. I groaned a bit, knowing that my detour had cost me a swift return home. Still, I knew I couldn’t ignore my biological needs any longer. I would have ended up stopping at some point anyway.
I put my phone in my pocket and looked back up at the counter. Hank was still there, smiling away.
“Uhhh… shouldn’t you be getting my order?”
He didn’t react to my query. Instead, he remained silent and motionless.
“Okay, then. I’m gonna leave now. Bye…”
Just as I turned around to head for the door, Hank spoke up.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”
“Why’s that?” I asked.
“Well, it would be a waste of time.”
I turned back and glared at him.
“What are you talking about? Are you gonna go get my food, or not?”
He laughed at me.
“You can’t leave now; the fun is just about to begin. Your order is being prepared as we speak. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.”
Hank pulled out a stopwatch from his apron. The digital read-out appeared to be counting backward from an hour. I didn’t know if it was a restaurant gimmick or a strange prank at my expense, but either way, I was fed up.
“Bye, Hank. It’s been weird. Thanks for nothing.”
I turned around and continued marching towards the exit. As I did this, my jaw dropped. The door was gone. My eyes quickly darted from left to right, revealing to me that the windows had vanished as well. There was nothing but continuous wall on either side of me. Perplexed, I looked back to Hank. He chuckled to himself, then asked me a question.
“So, how do you like your meat?”
“…What?” I asked, completely dazed.
“Your meat. How do you like it?”
“Ummm… well done… I like it well done.”
“Well done, huh? I like my meat as red as possible. A little color does the body good.”
I looked at him, confused.
“Hank… where’s the door?”
“Well, let’s just say it’s ‘temporarily unavailable’. Anything else I can help you with?”
“… Yeah. What the hell is going on here?”
“Well, there are a number of possibilities. I’ve outlined them here on the menu.”
Hank pointed up at the menu again, only this time, the food items were gone. The letters had seemingly been rearranged to form bullet points numbered one to three. I read them aloud.
“One; during your business trip, one of your colleagues slipped you some LSD as part of a half-hearted practical joke. What you are experiencing now is a product of the drug’s potent, hallucinogenic properties.”
“I like that one,” Hank said. “Unlikely, but it’s fun, wouldn’t you say?”
I moved on to the next possibility.
“Two: you fell asleep at the wheel. This is merely a vivid dream that will continue until you inevitably crash your car and die on impact. Alternatively, you may have already crashed your car and lived, albeit barely. You are currently in a coma, and your sleeping mind has formed a narrative based on the hunger you felt before the accident. The diner is a metaphor for the coma itself, and you won’t escape until you awaken, which may very well be never.”
Hank bore a look of concern.
“A little morbid, I’ll admit, but it is possible.”
I reluctantly looked at the last option.
“Three; something supernatural is afoot. Mysterious forces beyond your comprehension are at play, trapping you in an otherwise normal eatery. These forces will not allow you to leave under any circumstances. The best thing you can do is accept this, and allow yourself to succumb to whatever classic, paranormal tropes are thrown your way. Death will be your only escape.”
“That’s all I could come up with,” Hank said. “I’m not sure myself, but I’m leaning towards number three.”
“What the hell, Hank?! What the fuck is this? And shouldn’t you of all people know?”
“You would think so, wouldn’t ya? But I guess I wouldn’t tell you if I did, now would I?”
He offered me another one of his smiles as a consolation. I wanted to punch it clean off his face. Instead, I partook in a nervous breakdown of sorts. I slammed my body up against the wall where the door had been, I screamed at the top of my lungs, and I even grabbed a few bar stools and tossed them in different directions, as hard as my arms would allow. All the while, Hank remained calm and still, his lips stretched from ear to ear.
Just as I was about to take a swing at him, the kitchen door behind him popped open.
“Oh! Your order must be ready. Please, come with me.”
Hank disappeared into the darkness beyond the kitchen’s door frame. I stayed behind, hesitant to follow him. After a few moments, I heard him yell out to me.
“Come on, kid! Aren’t you hungry?”
It’s true; I was hungry. But I was more so cautious, especially given my peculiar situation. Because of this, I sat down in one of the booths and waited. I didn’t know what I was waiting for exactly, but it was all I could bring myself to do at that very moment. It wasn’t long before I heard Hank’s voice again.
“You can’t wait out there forever, kid.”
As if in response to his statement, the lights in the diner began to flicker. Then, one by one, they went out, spreading darkness from booth to booth. Eventually, I was left with just one bulb above me, wavering in and out of life. It provided me with just enough light to make my way to the kitchen and Hank knew it.
I had two choices. Go to the dark kitchen, or let the bulb go out and sit in the dark diner. Neither option was ideal, but deep down I knew only one had the potential to lead me to answers, no matter which one of the far-fetched scenarios on the menu was true. As such, I gave in to the narrative that was unfolding around me. It was clear to me at this point that fighting it was futile.
As I passed the threshold into the kitchen, the door shut itself behind me. Bright light poured out from the ceiling, washing over the entire room, revealing vibrant white walls and flooring. In the center of the room was a chair, slanted in a diagonal position – not unlike one you’d find in a dentist’s office. Next to the chair was Hank, who had traded in his diner uniform for a flashy, white lab coat.
“Finally! Come. Sit down. Take a load off.”
If only out of fear for what might happen next if I disobeyed, I did as Hank told me. It’s not like I had much of a choice at that point.
I slowly walked over to the chair and laid down. As I did this, leather straps wrapped themselves around my legs, arms, and forehead. I no longer had the luxury of movement or peripheral vision. Hank walked around to the front of the chair and pulled out his stopwatch.
“You’re doing fine, kid. Only forty minutes left.”
Without warning, six or seven shadowy figures came rushing over from either side of me. They brought with them rolling carts filled with what looked like medical equipment and power tools. I tried to make out even a single face in the crowd, but I could not. They lacked discernible features of any kind and moved about in perfect harmony with one another – like animated silhouettes, doing the bidding of some unseen higher power.
Over the course of the next few minutes, the figures poked and prodded me, drew blood, took hair samples, and inserted their utensils in places I rather not discuss. As much as I squirmed and screamed, none of them reacted – not even Hank. Feeling helpless, I eventually stopped struggling and simply braced myself for each needle that penetrated my skin. It made things a little more tolerable.
After a while, the figures stopped. Instead of going away like I’d hoped they would, they traded their needles and test tubes for surgical scissors and began cutting my clothes off of me. This continued until I was completely naked. I tried talking to Hank, but he was too busy playing around with the samples that had been collected. Even if he did respond, no amount of encouragement could have prepared me for what happened next.
Using nothing but scalpels and brute strength, the figures began cutting away at my skin. It was an absolutely horrific orchestra of deadly incisions, and one that continued until they peeled off every last bit of my epidermis. For one reason or another, I remained both alive and awake during the entire ordeal – though, at the time, I wished I could have died.
The pain was excruciating and came in waves. Just when I thought I was going numb, another unbearable, sharp, throbbing sensation would overtake my entire body. I’d never felt anything like it before. By the end of it, my ears were ringing from the volume of my own screams.
“There’s that color!” Hank exclaimed, gazing at the bloody mess that I’d become.
“Why are you doing this?!” I yelled.
“I’m not doing anything, kid. I’m just here to observe. Relax. Only twenty-seven minutes left.”
I would have argued with him further, but the figures grabbed the power-tools and started tearing through my muscle tissue. The buzzing sound of saws filled the room, drowning out my cries of agony. Through blood-soaked eyes, I could see Hank mouthing the words “Tick tock, tick tock,” over and over again. I watched him mock me until the buzzing stopped and the next stage of torture commenced.
I never wanted to see my organs. I never wanted to see my bone. I could have gone my whole life without knowing what they looked like. Now, I can’t get the image of them out of my head. I’m afraid I never will.
After successfully ripping apart my skin and muscles, the shadowy demons took hammers to my insides, smashing up my spleen, stomach, liver, kidneys, and lungs. They broke through the brittle, white ivory that made up my skeleton, making sure to leave no bone unturned. They even destroyed my skull and scooped my brain matter into jars. After all was said and done, they cleaned up my remains like fallen hair in a barbershop and swiftly left the room.
You’re probably wondering how I lived. I’m not entirely sure. They stripped away every physical aspect of my being, but I was still there – a sort of bubble of floating consciousness. I could still see and hear, but I was without a material body. As jarring as this realization was, I was just happy to no longer be in pain.
I didn’t realize it, but Hank was still in the room. He walked over to me and leaned in real close, stopwatch in hand.
“See? Now that wasn’t so bad, was it? And looky here, you’ve only got eighteen minutes left. How will you spend them? What things will you see? We had our fun; now it’s your turn.”
Hank turned around and walked out the kitchen door, leaving me alone in the white room. Within an instant, things began to change around me. The walls, floor, and ceiling faded, revealing an array of distant stars behind them. I somehow went from being in a diner on planet earth to floating around in the vacuum of space within mere moments.
Within seconds of the room completely fading from view, I was unwillingly hurled through the universe at light-speed. Everything around me blurred and my bodiless soul spun around uncontrollably. If I still had a stomach, it would have been turning.
I’ll never forget what I experienced in the coming moments, but I’ll never fully remember it either. Even now, I only have access to bits and pieces of what happened.  Perhaps the extreme velocity in which I traveled somehow damaged the fragile fabric of my memory, rendering me unable to retain the information I was presented with. Or maybe my feeble mind just couldn’t process the imagery. Who knows? In truth, I can only tell you what I felt. That will never go away.
As I sped through deep space, I was stopped in specific locations. Mostly foreign planets and dead star systems. In these moments, I saw unspeakable things. Gruesome things. Things I never knew could exist in the universe. I was plagued with disturbing sights and concepts of horrific proportions – so horrendous in fact, it made my impromptu autopsy look tame in comparison. I don’t know exactly what it was I saw out there, but I still feel an immense dread whenever I try to recall it.
After what felt like an eternity of torture, I was transported to what I can only assume was a location outside of the observable universe. There were no stars or any light to speak of – not even off in the distance. I was alone in a blanket of darkness, left to suffer with the memories of what I’d endured. Just as I was beginning to accept my circumstances, a light glow appeared in the distance. As it came closer to my position, I recognized its features. It was Hank’s stopwatch. The read-out was approaching zero.
10… 9… 8…
I started to feel weary, almost like I was falling into a deep sleep. I wondered if that was even possible in my current state.
7… 6… 5…
Like a projected movie, the past hour of my life appeared on the black canvas of space behind the stopwatch. It played in reverse at high speed, like a VHS tape stuck on rewind.
4… 3… 2…
Feeling faint, I tried to focus on the imagery. I re-lived everything that happened to me in the diner within a few mere seconds.
1… 0…
And poof.
Just like that, I was back in the diner parking lot, body and flesh intact. My car was there next to me, right where I parked it. I took out my phone and checked the time – it was 12:01. Everything had returned to normal, somehow. To the way it was before.
Elated, I jumped into my car and started it up. I was about to drive off like a bat out of hell, but I decided to take one last look at the diner. Somehow, within its walls, there does exist an extra hour in the day. How that’s possible and what its purpose is, I can’t be certain. Maybe Hank was right and that third scenario had something to do with it. The only thing I do know is that I survived, and I won’t be making another pit stop anytime soon, no matter how hungry I may be.
Just then, before my very eyes, the diner lifted itself from its foundation and flew upwards into the night sky."	8.63	16.0	Christopher Maxim	06/05/2020
Zipper Dog	"At first, I didn’t think anything of it. My neighbor would stop to chat with me, leash in hand, and I would catch glimpses of the metal slider dangling from its belly. I assumed it was wearing a piece of pet clothing, or that perhaps it was the byproduct of some awkward veterinarian procedure, but the more we chatted and the more I saw this mystery zipper, the more I realized it was out of the ordinary; clearly imbedded in the dog’s skin. It drew my attention every time we engaged in small talk, until finally one day, I decided to ask about it.
“Say, what is that zipper for on the little guy’s belly, anyway?”
“Oh, that? It’s a long story, I wouldn’t want to bore you.”
“I’ve got nothing but time.”
I wondered if she could see the beads of sweat forming above my brow.
“Really it’s nothing, just a safety measure.”
And that was it. She pretty much laughed it off, granting me little in the way of an explanation. Thinking back, her responses were downright vague and deflective. She could see how curious I was, so why not just tell me? And what exactly did she mean by “safety measure”?
As unfruitful as our conversation was, I didn’t press the matter any further. Days, weeks, months went by. I would occasionally see the dog’s strange cosmetic feature, but I brushed it off every time, knowing it would only haunt me if I dwelled on it. Still, the thought itched in the back of my mind. It wasn’t until a few months had passed that I would finally have the nerve to scratch it.
I was pulling up weeds along my fence when I looked over at my neighbor’s place, noticing the dog lying on the back porch. A stray cat wandered by, as often happened in our neighborhood. Without so much as a warning growl or malicious stance, the dog trotted over to the cat and scarfed it down, the sound of sharp teeth colliding with bone. The cat screeched in agony until it was no more. In a minute flat, its entire body was devoured. I was in shock.
The cat’s cries alerted my neighbor to the situation. She raced outside, grabbed the dog by the collar, and pulled him into the house. Through the sliding door, it was tough to make out, but I swear she unzipped him and reached inside, seemingly adjusting one of his organs. He didn’t flinch, not even a bit. After pulling her arm out, the dog dropped to the floor, dead as a doornail, from the looks of it. She then carried him outside and placed him back on the porch, arranging him into a sleeping position before getting in her car and leaving for the day.
This five-minute span of visual information was unlike anything I’d ever witnessed. Words like gruesome, strange, and horrific are too tame to describe what I saw. I was appalled beyond measure.
After the shock wore off, I hopped the fence and approached the dog’s carcass. I felt its neck; cold to the touch, no pulse. I looked to its underside, and there it was. That god-forsaken zipper in all of its mysterious glory. I felt kind of bad for the dog dying, but I had to know what that damned thing was there for. I needed an explanation for not only the dog’s, but my neighbor’s odd behavior just moments ago.
I slowly unzipped the dog’s belly, placating my curiosity with the satisfying sound of metal sliding across metal. I spread each side of the opening with my hands and peered in, divulging the animal’s inner workings. What I saw was absolutely dumbfounding.
My neighbor’s dog was… animatronic. There was wiring, gears, a tank where its stomach should have been; the whole nine yards. It didn’t make any sense, but there it was, staring me back from behind the zipper.
After scurrying back home in shock, I decided that my best course of action would be to call Animal Control. I could tell them my neighbor’s dog trespassed on my lawn and was attacking the neighborhood cats. They would show up, examine the robotic carcass, and then go from there. I knew there wasn’t a protocol for that sort of thing, but I assumed they could take care of things and contact the appropriate people, whether it be the police, the government, or The National Enquirer. As long as this weird predicament was taken care of, I could sleep easy, knowing that my neighbor’s strange robot dog wasn’t going around eating whatever it pleased.
Simple, right? Nope. Far from it.
Animal Control took a while to get there. By the time they arrived, my neighbor had come home and disposed of the evidence, hiding the dog somewhere in her home. The Animal Control officer apologized for the misunderstanding and left, leaving my neighbor on her front porch, glaring in my direction. It appeared privacy meant nothing to the local authorities. Just my luck.
The days that followed were… different. My neighbor’s dog had sprung to life, re-activated by its master, no doubt. They would walk their usual path around the cul-de-sac, but would not stop for small talk. I knew her dirty little secret, after all. I was no longer a friendly neighbor to be conversed with, oh no. I was an enemy; a danger to this woman’s unusual way of life. Even if I meant no harm to her or her strange choice of pet, she didn’t seem to see it that way. She continued to give me the cold shoulder for about a month and a half before finally speaking with me again on one of her daily strolls.
“Hey there!”
“Hello. Everything alright?”
“Just peachy. I’m having a cookout on Saturday at noon. You’re more than welcome to come.”
Strange. We weren’t on speaking terms for over a month, and now I was suddenly invited over? Maybe this was her extending an olive branch my way; her way of saying, “No hard feelings.”
“Yeah, sure. I can make it. Sounds like a good time.”
“Great! I’ll add you to the list.”
As she walked away, I felt the need to apologize, even if her dog was a weird, cat-eating robot.
“Hey, about that Animal Control call. I just wanted to say-”
“Don’t worry about it. Water under the bridge. See you Saturday!”
She hurried off home, and that was that. Problem solved.
Or so I thought.
The night before the cookout, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing what sounded like footsteps creeping around the perimeter of my house. Every time I got up to investigate, the sound ceased, and the coast appeared to be clear. It was either a prank at my expense, a burglar taking their sweet time to pull the trigger, or ghosts roaming around in the night. Either way, it left me anxious, making sleep a distant dream, just out of my reach.
During a particularly loud set of footsteps, I raced downstairs, just in time to catch four glowing dots peering in through my living room window. This was enough to make my neck hairs stand upright. Though terrified, I wasted no time grabbing a ball bat and storming out my front door to greet the would-be intruders. I may be old, but I can still kick some ass when needed, especially when it involves crossing my property line.
To my astonishment, my yard was empty. I covered every side of the house, only to find no one – not a soul in sight in any direction I looked. I don’t care how fast you can sprint. Nobody could have made it out of eyeshot in such a short period of time, even in those low-light conditions. Baffled, and even more anxious than before, I locked up every last door and window in my home before crawling under the covers like a frightened child, scared of the mystery figures lurking in the shadows.
The footsteps dissipated over the course of the night, and as the sun came up over the horizon, so too did my fear. My waking nightmare had ended, but not before putting a weary, sleep-deprived frame of mind in its place. In a sluggish slur of movement, I grudgingly made my way to my neighbor’s house around noon, ready as I would ever be for the neighborhood get-together.
Oddly enough, there were no cars in the driveway, aside from her own. I wondered if I got the date wrong, but after knocking on the door, she greeted me with a smile and rushed me into the house. We exchanged pleasantries, and she sat me down at a bar stool in the kitchen. After a few moments of awkward silence, I mustered up the courage to ask about the elephant in the room.
“So… where is everybody?”
“You’re already here, silly.”
I tilted my head, puzzled.
“What about everyone else?”
“There is no one else. You’re the only person I invited.”
All at once the pieces clicked into place. I felt stupid for not realizing it sooner. Her sudden kindness, the noises the night before. There was no cookout. There was never any cookout. I was in the middle of a trap, lured in largely due to my own idiocy. I should have guessed that something sinister was going on the moment I unzipped that dog.
“So, what happens now?” I asked.
“You’ll see. Just sit tight.”
I quickly jumped up from my chair and turned towards the door. With inhuman speed, she bolted in front of me, a large kitchen knife in hand.
“Not so fast.”
I stood, still as stone, intimidated by her fluid motions and firm stance.
“We need to talk.”
“About what?”
I knew exactly what.
“Don’t play dumb with me.”
And that’s when I noticed it. On her chest, peaking through the top of her blouse. I would have missed it had the sunlight coming through the window not danced across its metal.
She had a zipper too.
Stricken to my core with fear, my gaze was interrupted by an angry hand gesture.
“My eyes are up here!”
The moments that ensued are a bit fuzzy, but I can only guess that I was knocked out or chloroformed, as I awoke strapped to a chair in a new room. Given the staircase, I assumed I was in her basement, though this realization didn’t help me any. I attempted to break free of my restraints, but it was no use; unless she freed me herself, I was fastened to that chair for life.
In absence of mobility, I decided to give the place a once-over. The staircase was to my left and a concrete wall to my right, but directly in front of me was a work station, complete with about a dozen computers. This is where my neighbor sat, a USB cord snaking out of her unzipped chest, typing away at a blinding rate. Her motives were still unclear to me.
Though confined to the one view, I was able to turn my neck enough in both directions to form a decent picture of what was behind me. It was a wall of cages, each housing an identical copy of her dog. They didn’t move, even in the slightest, likely just as animatronic as she was. What on God’s green earth had I stumbled into?
Just then, my neighbor ripped the cord from her chest and walked over to me.
“Ahh, good. You’re awake. Did you have a nice nap?”
I refused to reply, looking her up and down in disgust, trying to make out what this thing was that was speaking to me.
“What’s the matter? Dog got your tongue?”
I remained silent, in lieu of her taunting me.
“That’s alright. You just need to listen. Sit tight. I’ll be right back”
She walked over to her work station and grabbed something before reclaiming her spot in front of me.
“I’ve worked too hard in this location to have you screwing things up on me. Then again, it’s my own fault. I was careless. I never should have left my core on the porch like that.”
I assumed she was talking about the dog.
“I want you to look at this.”
She placed the object at eye-level. It was a badge of sorts, upon which was a logo that read “Syntheti-Tech.”
“I’m an android. I work for a large company, moving from location to location, gathering specific information that is crucial to our initiative. You can’t know anything beyond that. Hell, you already know far too much.”
I hadn’t noticed it at first, but she seemed to keep playing with her zipper.
“God, I am so sick of this fucking meat suit.”
Before my very eyes, she removed her clothing and unzipped herself down to the groin. In the most unnatural way possible, she slid out of her own skin, revealing to me her true form. She was nothing but a pile of electronics, pieced together in a human shape. It was a strange sight, nauseating in every sense of the word. The way she moved and spoke while like this was downright sickening.
“I can’t say anymore, but I want you to know that our work is necessary. If you were to speak these truths to the world above, you would be jeopardizing everything we’ve accomplished. You have to submit to our intentions and see that they are just.”
I didn’t know what to make of this. I simply looked away, wishing not to see her grotesque, animatronic face any longer. Unfortunately for me, she grabbed it and forced it in her direction anyway, the feeling of cold metal enveloping my jaw.
“You need to promise me that you will submit. You are not to tell anyone of any of this. Do you understand?”
I nodded in agreement, but only because I wanted her hand off of my face. Luckily, she let go and backed away.
“Good. You know, we’re not so bad when you get to know us. In a sense, we’re just like you.”
Internally, I scoffed at the thought of this. I was nothing like her, and not just because of her appearance; I was never one to go around kidnapping my neighbors, holding them captive in my basement. It just wasn’t my cup of tea.
“Well, this is it. I’ll need you to take over from here. Don’t make the same mistake I did, lest you regret it for the rest of your life.”
This was the last thing she said to me, though I had no idea what any of it meant. I must have been knocked unconscious again, because the next thing I remember was waking up on her basement floor, no longer bound by my restraints. For one reason or another, she didn’t kill me. I was a free man.
Without warning, a group of trained operatives burst through the basement door and raced down to help me up.
“Are you alright?”
“Yes. I’m fine. What’s going on?”
I noticed a few of the men walk on opposite sides of the room to gather evidence. One guy ripped open a cage, grabbed one of the dogs, and unzipped him, revealing it to be nothing but a hollow carcass.
“They’re empty, sir. A collection of shells.”
“Just as I suspected. No matter. Load them into the truck with the hard-drives. Hopefully she didn’t wipe them before she left.”
I must have looked completely bewildered, because the gentleman grabbed me by the shoulders and looked me straight in the eye.
“Everything’s fine now. We’ve been on this woman’s tail for a long time. We may not have captured her, but this is still a big win. And it’s all thanks to you.”
I was still confused, but more so relieved that it was all over.
“Are you sure you’re alright? Don’t need a ride to the hospital?”
I shook my head, not wishing to be poked and prodded after what I’d endured. I didn’t trust doctors much anyway. I just wanted to go home.
“Okay. Let me walk you to your house.”
I agreed, and we were off. I couldn’t wait to get inside and put the whole ordeal behind me. That was the plan, anyway.
Whatever government officials they were, the entire crew picked the place clean and left my neighborhood within a couple of hours. That night I received a call from them for a statement regarding the situation. I obliged and asked some questions myself. Though the information was privileged, I guilted them into giving up some details, claiming I needed some “peace of mind” so I could sleep at night. The fact that I was just a ‘frail, old man’ helped too.
It would seem my neighbor was a high-ranking disciple in an android cult hell-bent on infiltrating various government agencies. They were currently in the process of recruiting new members to aid in their cause. That’s all I was told, which was more than I thought I’d get. This was enough to placate my curiosity and keep me from dwelling on the events as they unfolded. I thanked the man on the other end and hung up, content with my findings.
After ending the call, I heard a knock at my front door. I didn’t usually get visitors that late at night, but I suspected it would be one of my neighbors, asking about the sting operation that just took place next door. I opened the door, and to my surprise, there was no person there to greet me. No. Not a person. Instead, there was a dog, identical to my neighbor’s. Before I could process its arrival, it trotted inside and sat on the floor. A voice then emanated from its collar.
“Shut the door.”
I did as the dog said, baffled and afraid.
“Hello. I am Serial #724234. I will be your core companion on your journey of fulfillment. True adventure awaits. Would you like to begin your first task?”
I didn’t know how to respond or what in God’s name was happening, but it was at this point that I felt an itch running up the length of my torso. It was subtle at first but grew to the point that I had to reach down my shirt and scratch at it. That’s when I felt a familiar metal caress my fingers. It took a moment for it to sink in, but I knew exactly what I was feeling.

Every Year on My Birthday, I Receive a Letter	"Today marks the twentieth anniversary of my father’s death, taken away by a single, senseless act. It just so happens that today is also my birthday.

He’d been working late. As he often did, regardless of birthdays or holidays. I understood it was a painful memory for him, and though our relationship had always been a bit strained, I never blamed him for making a living. Because, as a single father, he had a lot on his mind, and I respected that.

That night, on my eighteenth birthday. My father was hit by a drunk driver on his way home. He never even made it to the hospital. His insides were so utterly torn to pieces by the impact, that he simply died before the paramedics could even show up.

A few weeks after the funeral, I was trying to piece together the legal mess that comes following someone’s death, inheritance, and so on. It certainly wasn’t anything a teenager should have to deal with, but I was alone, no close family, no one to guide me through the world.

Ironically, his lawyer seemed to know more about my father than myself, after dealing with whatever assets left behind, he’d been given a set of instructions, all prepared by my father should he meet an untimely demise. I signed all the necessary documents, and was given some advice on how to survive the loss of a loved one…

Then I received a letter.

It was wrapped in a beautiful, silver envelope, only decorated with my name. I opened it, careful not to rip it apart, and started reading.

Dear Richard,

I’ll start this letter by admitting to one undeniable truth. I’m not a good man, and I’ve been an even shittier father. I’ve made plenty of mistakes, left too many things unsaid.

I could make up the excuse that I’m simply a product of my time and the people that raised me, but I’ll cut through the bullshit and just apologize.

Your mother died while giving birth, it’s a hard fact to live with, and though I’ve seemed cold at times, I need you to know that I never blamed you for any of it. How could I? You came to this world as a beautiful little creature, never asking for life, yet appreciating every moment of it.

I’m writing this on your birthday, you’ve just turned eighteen, and I’m staying behind at work to finish this up. I don’t think I’ll hand it to you yet, I’m still not done dealing with my own issues, but I promise that as soon as I’m able to man up, I’ll tell you all the things I should have as you grew up.

That I’m proud of you, that I love you.

I wish I could say this to your face, but I’m a coward. Taught myself that emotions are for the weak. So, for now, I’ll put this on paper. It’ll be waiting among my other things, and my last will and testament, should anything ever happen to me, but that’ll hopefully be many years from now, and by then you won’t even need this letter to remind you.

You’re a better man than me, Rick, I hope you know that. I’m sorry I haven’t been a better father, but I promise I’ll change.

I love you,
Dad

My father had died the same day he wrote that letter. He probably instructed the secretary to send the letter to his lawyer in the morning. I don’t really know how else they would have gotten ahold of it.

I read the letter a couple of more times, before folding it neatly back up, then I just sat down on the floor and cried. I’d kept it together for so long. I never shed a tear as the police officer handed me the news, and I continued my cold appearance throughout the funeral proceedings.

Because he was right, we’d never been close, and I never thought he loved me, but hearing these simple words, though only from a piece of paper; Was far more than I could handle.

I dug up some old photo albums from my childhood. Sifting through them, and realizing he always seemed happy, smiling wide in each photo as I turned the pages. Seeing those memories in a new light truly broke my heart. We’d left so much unsaid, but all the emotions were there, shown through the smiles on our faces, and the moments we shared.

That’s what truly mattered, not the words that could have been said, but the time spent together.

And that would have been it, my father had passed and life moved on. I kept the small house for myself, it was already bought and paid for, and I kept on with my studies.

Then, one year later, on my birthday; I received another letter.

It was a beautiful, silver envelope, just like the last one. Encased in a pattern of vines and bizarre-looking symbols, just small enough to remain hidden at first glance. In the center, it simply said my name, written crudely, but not without charm.

His handwriting was unmistakable, the letter without a doubt came from my father, but how had he sent it one year past his demise? I thought about it briefly, and figured he must have instructed his lawyer to send a letter on my birthday each year. It sounded unlike something he would have done, but I’d already been surprised the last year, so I just opened it and started reading.

Dear Richard,

Where do I begin? I’m not even sure if this letter will reach you considering where I am, but I’m giving it a shot anyway.

It’s been exactly one year since my death, though I have to admit, time works a bit differently here. It feels like a hundred years have passed since you turned eighteen, yet, I know that for you, only one year has gone by.

I’m not much of a poet, but I’m sure not even Edgar Allan Poe could have found the words to describe the beauty of this place. It’s simply put, unbelievable.

You need to know that I never suffered. The car hit me at such a speed that it killed me instantly, no pain, nor any memory from the incident. My world just disappeared, and a moment later I woke up surrounded by the most beautiful light.

Where here is? I’m not exactly sure, I suppose it’s heaven, though I can’t say exactly what I did to deserve such a gift.

It’s like a city, stretching endlessly as far as I can possibly see, buildings, spires covered in silver that stretch up into the sky, hiding among the clouds above. Perfectly constructed and each magnificent in their own way.

There are no horizons here, the world only ends when it’s too far away to comprehend, just tiny figures dancing in the distance, but it’s beautiful nonetheless, enveloped in colors I never knew existed.

It’s perfect.

We don’t feel hunger, thirst nor tiredness. Yet, the food is bountiful and always tastes exquisite. I don’t need it, but it’s a joy to feast nonetheless, never feeling too full, never gaining, nor losing weight.

There are some things I can’t tell you. The guards, or angels? I’m not sure what to call them, but they’re telling me I have to follow the rules. Upon asking they simply scoffed and told me to figure it out on my own. They’re certainly not the beautiful creatures I expected them to be, but that doesn’t really matter.

What matters is that I’m looking for your mother, but in an endless city, that’s easier said than done. There’s really no register here, so no one can actually tell me where to find anyone, though I suppose with eternity ahead of me, I’ll just have to keep looking.

The population is strangely scattered here, and none I spoke to have been here for more than a few years. I suspect there’s some kind of hierarchy in place, or maybe we have to wander further into the city to find our loved ones. It’s a lot to take in, and wish I could tell you more, but now I need to go.

In any case, I love you, Rick. I wish I had said that while I was still alive, but at the very least this is better than nothing.

Love,
Dad

I wasn’t sure how to react. Sure, it was his handwriting, but it had to be some kind of joke. I called up his old lawyer and asked if he’d sent the letter on behalf of my father. He denied it, saying his job had ended the moment I signed over my father’s remaining assets here on Earth.

Next, I turned to the few friends I had, interrogated them about the letter, without revealing its content. They acted innocent, which made me feel guilty. They’d been great as long as I’d known them, always there for me, and without them, I couldn’t have survived the passing of my father.

So, without any further solutions, I let it go. I put the letter alongside the rest of my father’s belongings, and forced myself to move on.

* * * * * *
I almost forgot, I truly did, and then the third letter arrived. Yet again, on my birthday, exactly one year later.
Dear Richard,

I found her, after an impossibly long search I finally found her! Your mother, Helen, the love of my life. I knew she had to be here, she’d always been one of the best people I knew.

I guess I should explain.

As I said in my last letter: Time doesn’t flow as you’d expect, at least not here. Despite that, we keep track of it just like we do back on Earth, I suppose it makes it easier to look out for our loved ones. It just… feels longer.

Your mother, she’s not exactly herself. I found her on top of one of the spires. Rick, I’ve never seen her like this, she looks nothing like the woman I knew and loved before, yet I know it’s her, I can feel it in my heart. She’s so skinny, emaciated, and on the brink of starvation. I didn’t even realize that could happen, I myself haven’t eaten in weeks, yet I feel completely fine.

She just keeps repeating the same sentences over and over:

“I don’t understand, I tried to be good, what did I do wrong?”

I tried to convince her to leave with me, but she doesn’t even recognize who I am anymore, and I can’t simply force her, believe me, I tried. Up here, it’s just impossible to do anything, to anyone, against their will. I realized that when I tried to write about what I saw on the first day, but found that I couldn’t form the words.

It’s hard to describe, but we have free will here as long as we follow the rules, anything else is literally impossible.

The angels turned their attention to me after I hung around your mother for more than a few days. They told me to leave her alone. I tried to explain, but they wouldn’t listen.

I had to leave her, Rick, I couldn’t stand to see her like that, but I’ll keep checking up on her, I promise.

Once I tried the few ideas I could think of, I some other people here for help, but most of them are like myself, new and clueless. The few ‘veterans,’ I’ve found only tell me to let it be, that I’ll get in trouble if I keep messing around.

I’ve got to go now, they’re looking at me.

I love you, Rick. I hope we don’t see each other too soon. Just live a good life, it’s far too short.

His handwriting seemed rushed towards the end. I must have read through the letter a dozen times, trying my best to figure out what was going on. Since I had no means of tracking the letter, I couldn’t do much other than listen to my gut.

As strange as it might sound, I believed every word I read.

I decided I would respond, that I would write to my dad and see what happened. Honestly, I felt kind of stupid as I put the letter down at my doorstep, expecting it to magically vanish during the night, but even the smallest chance at contacting the afterlife was one worth taking.

Of course, when I opened the door the following day, it was still there, mushy with smudged ink from a small storm that passed during the night.

Defeated, I could do nothing but wait for another year to pass…

* * * * * *
As my birthday rolled around, I hatched a plan to catch whoever delivered the letters. I camped outside in my garden, waiting for the culprit. Hours passed, I waited from the early hours, and as midday arrived I decided to call it quits, and head back inside.
There it lay, on the other side of my front door, on top of my slippers; A perfect, silver envelope with my name written on it.

Dear Richard,

I’ve found someone willing to answer my questions. They claim they’ve kept an eye on me for some time, but that I wasn’t ready to see them, so they kept me waiting, hoping I’d one day come around.

I’m not exactly sure what they meant by ready, but they say that until I see what this place truly is, I won’t understand.

Unlike my other companions, these people weren’t smiling. They didn’t seem healthy, but appeared as sickly, twisted human beings that have long since forgotten who they once were.

They gave me a heads up though, that time only passes as fast as we need it to. That a year can feel like a century, or it can pass by in a week, whatever that means.

They mentioned something they simply refer to as ‘The Dome’. They say it’s in the center of the city, an almost impossible distance away. They offered to take me there once I’m ready, but I can’t, I need to stay, I have to take care of your mother.

Of course, the Silver City still stands tall and magnificent, but the food has lost its taste, drinks just feel… unnecessary. I’ve indulged on occasion, tried to recreate the feelings I had when I first arrived here, but to no avail. My only purpose now is to find a way of reconnecting with your mother, I know I can get through to her, I just need to find a way.

While I search for answers, I still visit her from time to time, just to sit by her side as she stares off into the distance. Maybe I’ll one day get a glimpse of what occupies her mind, and hopefully she knows that she’s not alone. I know she’s utterly broken, but as long as I’m able to, I’ll protect her, I promise you that.

Happy birthday, Rick. I’m happy I have the opportunity to stay in touch, even if it’s impossible for you to respond.

I love you,
Dad

That’s how my life went on from then. Each year, on my birthday, my father sent me a silver letter. Just updates from the afterlife, and as bizarre as it all felt, I felt happy to have a connection with my dad, though it had been partially tainted by the image of my sickly mother standing atop a spire.

* * * * * *
On the fifteenth anniversary of my father’s death, my life had taken a drastic turn for the better. I’d just gotten engaged to the love of my life, after five years. This all came on top of a promotion at work. All in all, life seemed to be going my way, and my birthday was just around the corner, and as always, I eagerly awaited my silver letter.
There it was, lying on the doorstep. Except, rather a perfectly smooth envelope with vines and symbols engraved onto the surface, I found a crumpled piece of paper. One covered in erratic handwriting, incomprehensible phrases and drawings.

Richard,

She’s gone, your mother, Helen… I went back to the spire, I had an idea, but she’d simply vanished, leaving nothing behind, no trace that she ever existed. I knew something was wrong even before getting there; The buildings have always seemed impossibly tall, but that time I just couldn’t get up the stairs. They kept going for days, weeks of climbing, and once I finally reached the top…

…I was alone.

I’ve searched the entire section of the city, climbed each building to the top, asked whatever person willing to talk to me.

I don’t know what to do.

I haven’t eaten anything since we last spoke a year ago, nor have I had a drink. I don’t sleep, I don’t do anything other than search for her.

I wanted to send you a letter earlier, I needed to tell you what happened, but I had to wait, because of the rules, those damned rules.

A few weeks ago I approached one of the guards. I don’t know why I hadn’t thought of it before, but if heaven was real, then God had to be somewhere up here. I asked the guard about it, and he laughed at me.

He touched me on my shoulder and whispered a few incomprehensible words into my ear. It was like a veil was lifted off me, I could truly see this place for what it is, a concrete jungle with a sky so dark I don’t know how I didn’t notice it before.

The buildings around me, once what I would consider works of art, so perfect, a creation that simply couldn’t be built by man. I finally see them for what they are: old, run-down concrete prisons on the brink of collapse. They should have fallen long, long ago, yet, there they stand, defying all logic, a pitiful sight to behold.

The people I came here with have long since gone. All of them are heading towards the Dome. In their place, I’m finding more and more people who’ve been here for an eternity. Hundreds, thousands of years, and they all seem the same, they are all diseased, whatever features they once had, whoever they once were, it doesn’t matter anymore.

They’ve simply existed for far too long, an eternity of time to wash away what once made them human.

I think it’s time for me to wander through the Silver City, maybe I just need to reach the Dome, maybe I can find your mother there, maybe I can finally get some answers.

Whatever the cost, I can’t go on like this. I’m not sure how long it will be until I send another letter, the road towards the Dome is… different, but this is just something I have to do.

I hope you understand,
Dad

* * * * * *
Five years passed without another silver letter. The first year I was worried, the second I felt scared, but as the third and fourth rolled around, I felt… relieved.
It was as if a heavy burden had been lifted off my shoulders. I’d never been much a religious person before my father died, yet I never feared death, but now, knowing that what awaited me on the other side wasn’t the perfect haven we’d all been taught about, I felt horrified.

As guilty as it still makes me feel, I never wanted to receive another letter from my father.

Then, we arrive at today, my birthday. It’s the twentieth anniversary of my father’s death. As a habit, the first thing I did in the morning was to check the front door.

There, on the ground, lay a silver envelope…

I picked it up in uncomfortable anticipation. My heart raced as I held it with trembling hands. Crudely drawn pictures covered the front; Symbols I couldn’t decipher, and a drawing of a dome-like structure surrounded by bizarre shapes that I assumed to be twisted spires.

On the inside, I found another letter. It was filled with meaningless phrases, jumbled words and sentences I couldn’t understand. It was a mess of erratic handwriting, nonsensical and horrifying. From the several pages filled to the brim with text of varying sizes, all I could make out was the following:

They gave us everything we wanted, all the imaginable pleasures of the world and more, only to take it away piece by piece until there was nothing left but the memory of better times. A cruel joke played on us by whatever creature rules this place.

I thought this was heaven, but it’s not. I’m in Hell, we’re all in Hell, but It’s not a punishment, it never was;

It’s just all there is…

Death is the beginning of a nightmare that never ends, and there’s no way out, no alternative.

I’m going to enter the Dome now, I don’t know what I’ll find on the other side, but I feel this will be the last letter I ever send you.

Enjoy what you have left of life, Richard, because once it’s over, you’ll be right here by my side."	8.96	25.0	Richard Saxon	05/30/2020
The Backrooms	"Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Hello?”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Hello? Somebody? Anybody?!”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Can anybody hear me?! Please! Please, get me out of here!”
Casey stirred. He couldn’t see anything, but he could hear her loud and clear.
“Dove? Is that you?”
Of course it was. Her voice was unmistakable.
“Case?” Scratch scratch scratch scratch “Casey! Where are you?!”
“I’m right here, Dove! Follow my voice!”
Casey was shaking in his sleep. Lucidity was creeping in, but the nightmare’s grip was strong.
“I can’t, I’m stuck!” Scratch scratch scratch scratch “Casey, you have to get me out of here! Say you’ll get me out of here!”
Casey’s heart was hammering inside his head, but he couldn’t hear it over the scratches.
“Out of where, Dove? Where are you stuck?!”
He knew that it was just a dream. Dove was dead. Not only that, but it had been an open casket funeral and Dove’s coffin was padded everywhere. The scratches weren’t making any sense, so they couldn’t be anything other than a figment of his imagination – as was the scared voice of his dead friend.
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“The Backrooms, Casey. I’m stuck in the Backrooms.”
Casey woke up drenched in sweat. Again.
* * * * * *
It had to have been the sound of heavy rain hitting the lacquered wood – not the general sobbing, nor the priest straining his voice over the wrath of mother nature. It couldn’t have been car noises or the like, that’s for sure. The cemetery was nowhere near traffic-ridden streets. No. It was the rain falling on the coffin lid. That had to be the sound that made Casey feel so uneasy.
“Dove’s grace was admired by classmates and teachers alike…”
Casey pressed his lips together and shook his head absent-mindedly. Grace. Grace, of all things, was brought up at Dove’s funeral. What had Dove been like? Smart, yes. Strong, very. Beautiful, without a shadow of a doubt, but graceful? Her back was always drooping like she was the human version of a question mark and she never saw a problem in playing soccer wearing a skirt.
If Dove’s spirit was present, the likelihood of her face-palming herself, was staggering. Casey chuckled to himself at that mental image. His father smacked him over the head.
“Pull yourself together.”, he hissed from between clenched teeth.
Casey was very well put together. He was so well put-together, that he was the only one to recognize the eulogy for the garbage it was. Whoever wrote it, relied too much on their google search. Casey eyed Dove’s mother. The woman was devastated, surely, but this wasn’t a funeral for her daughter, but a funeral for the daughter she wished she had.
The rain was unrelenting. Casey pictured Dove standing beside the big oak tree, ten feet from where he was, dressed in her maroon overalls, mocking every word coming out of the priests’ mouth. Dove had been the funniest person Casey ever knew – mostly on Monday mornings when she would reenact the Sunday service she had attended the day prior. Dove was not like those other kids who were forced to go to church because their parents said so, oh no. The Sunday service was her favorite time of the week. Not only would she listen carefully to everything the priest said, so she could debunk it later, but she also paid close attention to the other people attending. Dove loved calling out hypocrisy, and nothing quenched her thirst as churchgoers did. Although selectively, she thrived on gossip.
Theatre critic. Every hour Dove spent studying, every time she opened a word document to write something that wasn’t school-related, every time their DnD squad would talk about dreams and aspirations, Dove would mention, she’ll be a theatre critic someday. Grace? Theatre critics are not graceful. Grace is surrounded by pastel colors and Dove was as rich in pigment as Indian ink.
Why didn’t the priest mention that instead? That her biggest passion was writing and that she had more drive than quicksilver in a sauna? Why didn’t anybody point out that only four of Dove’s seven cousins showed up? Why did Dove, of all people, have to die? Why was the world so unfair? Why was it raining?!
There were too many people crying just for show and Casey didn’t want to contribute to the masquerade. Either way, the tears wouldn’t come. Casey felt too uneasy to cry. There was something about the noise around him…
It wasn’t the sobbing, nor the priest straining his voice over the wrath of mother nature. Casey kept telling himself, that it was the hard raindrops against the lid of the coffin.
That had to have been it – that had to be what sounded like scratching.
* * * * * *
Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
Three weeks have passed since Dove’s funeral and the nightmares just got worse and worse. Casey still couldn’t see anything, but Dove’s voice reverberated within the confines of his mind, louder than it would have if she were right next to him.
“Hello?”
Dream-Casey was set on not responding this time around.
“Hello?! Is anybody there?”
Casey felt his temperature rise, but he managed to keep the dream version of himself quiet. He was not going to interact with his dead friend. Not tonight. Casey was sick and tired of feeling like he hadn’t slept in years. He was sick and tired of dreading nightfall, knowing full well that the torment will start anew once he lowered his head on the cool pillow.
“Can anybody hear me?! Please! Please, get me out of here!”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Case!”
Dove was crying.
“Casey, please… please talk to me! I’m so scared, Casey, I’m begging you… “
Something was tickling Casey at the temples. Sweat or tears, he couldn’t tell. That sensation should have been enough to wake anybody up, but, as always, Dove’s calling from the other realm, had no mercy.
“I need you, Casey! Please! Please get me out of here!”
He knew he shouldn’t give in to his mind playing tricks on him. The real Dove was six feet under, feeding maggots and fertilizing the soil around her. Even so, Casey’s will was hanging by a thread as fragile as spider webs.
“I thought you loved me…”
The thread broke.
“Don’t you love me, Casey?”
“Of course I do…”
“Then get me out of here. Say you’ll get me out of the Backrooms.”
Casey woke up drenched in sweat again. Not only that, but he was also crying and shaking from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers.
* * * * * *
The school cafeteria was pretty empty. Casey’s friends were all sitting at their usual spot alongside the elephant in the room, which was Dove’s unoccupied seat.
Karina, one of the two girls at the table, took her yogurt cup and almost slammed it on Casey’s tray as soon as he sat down.
“What the hell are you doing?”, Casey wanted to know.
Karina’s face was stern and her voice, even more so.
“You need to eat.”
Even though the girl was one year his junior, she acted like everybody’s mother.
“I am eating.”
Casey pointed to the almost-portion of mashed potatoes in front of him. Angie and Callum exchanged a glance and both of them placed their muffins on Casey’s tray. Angie also gave him her soda for good measure.
“You guys are being ridiculous. I don’t want your food!”
“That’s too bad, ‘cause you’re having it whether you like it or not.”
Casey was about to return the items to their respective givers, but Brian stopped him with a soft shove of his hand.
“Please, man. We all miss her, but you can’t go on like this.”
Casey took a second to look at his friends. Everybody looked bad. The bags under his own eyes were the worst, but his friends weren’t looking like they were about to walk into a photoshoot either. Brian was so pale, the contrast to his freckles made him look like somebody sprayed motor oil on his face. Karina stopped wearing jewelry altogether and for someone with five facial piercings, that’s saying a lot. Callum and Angie used to be all over each other during lunch, now even spotting them holding hands, has become rare.
Casey hovered over his tray. He said nothing, but him opening Karina’s yogurt cup was all the reassurance his friends needed. The thanks went unspoken, just like the many sentiments that strengthened their bond in the past weeks.
The lunch break was halfway over, until…
“Stop…” Angie didn’t mean to say it aloud. She was taken aback when four pairs of eyes met hers inquiringly. Callum squeezed her knee.
“Everything alright?”
Angie looked at her boyfriend with reindeer eyes. Her lips started to quiver and she shook her head slowly.
“I just want it to stop.”
Callum brushed a strain of her hair behind her ear and Angie took that as an invitation to lean into him.
“They will, baby. Just give it time.”
The moment they shared looked way too intimate to be interrupted by outsiders, yet Karina couldn’t help herself:
“‘They’?”
Callum threw her a poisonous glance.
“Don’t, K. Not now.”
But Angie didn’t share his apprehension. She detached herself from Callum’s side and brushed both hands over her face in an attempt at pulling herself together.
“Ever since Dove died… I’ve been having these dreams.”
Casey felt his throat constrict.
“They’re… weird. Like, Dove is, technically, never in them, and I don’t hear her or anything, but… it’s like, I know she’s there. And I know she’s scared.”
Angie’s voice broke on the last two words.
“You don’t have to do this, baby.” Callum stroke her back, but that only seemed to make her more upset.
“But I want to, just–”
Everybody was holding their breaths.
“It’s… these rooms.”
Casey felt his heart beating inside his skull.
“And they’re repetitive, like room, next to room, next to room, like… underground parking lots that are divided into sections, but narrow and never-ending. And there are no doors or windows, just rooms beyond rooms, like it’s this hallway with huge mirrors at both ends, so it just looks like it goes on and on and on… room, next to room, next to room. And it’s so odd, everything is, like… this old, ugly yellow. And it’s bright, but not that nice brightness, it’s that… abandoned hospital light. The one where you don’t know if it’s safer with the lights on or off…”
Angie was out of breath.
“I’m not crazy.”
“Nobody said that, baby…”
“I’m not crazy!”
Half of the cafeteria turned to look their way.
“Nobody thinks you’re crazy, Ange…” Karina stretched her hand over the table to caress her friend’s. “…and if they do –” she turned her head towards the on-lookers. “– let me at them!”
Casey hid his shaking hands under the table.
Everybody did their best to comfort Angie until lunch break was almost over. Callum, Angie, and Karina stood up, trays in hands, ready to leave for their next class. The couple said goodbye, but Casey didn’t hear anything.
“You guys okay?”
Karina was looking at Brian and Casey. Brian smiled and reassured her, that he’ll join her once Casey finished eating. Karina shrugged, squeezed Casey’s shoulder, and left the boys alone.
Casey and Brian were never particularly close, but they shared an understanding for each other that was hard to explain. Both were men of few words and both appreciated the same things in life and other people.
“You okay, man? You don’t look too good.”
Brian eyed Casey carefully. His stare was focused and his face had a little more color to it than it did an hour prior.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.”
Casey tried easing a smile into his statement but Brian’s stare was so intense, Casey could feel it prickle on his skin. That’s when he noticed it, too: Brian was shaking.
“So, um… Angie’s dreams. Weird, huh?”
“Yeah. Poor thing.”
The bell was supposed to ring any second now. The last of the students in the cafeteria had already gotten up to return their trays. Neither Brian nor Casey broke their stare-down. Brian disrupted the silence, however.
“What about you?”
“What about me?”
“Any weird dreams lately?”
Casey felt the pits of his shirt grow cold and wet.
“No. What makes you ask that?”
His tone was way harsher than he intended it to be. Brian flinched a little and, just like that, his eyes grew wide and he broke the contact.
“Sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it, I just thought you looked like… never mind.”
“You thought I looked like, what?”
Casey moved closer to his friend. Brian seemed to reassess the situation and looked like he couldn’t get away from it fast enough.
“Sorry, dude, my bad. I misinterpreted something. Just forget it, okay?”
Brian rose to leave and Casey shot up and grabbed his arm with force to bruise.
“Tell me, god damn it!”
The lunch lady called out to them, reminding them of something or another that they should or shouldn’t be doing.
“Tell me. Please.”
Casey’s voice was so quiet, he barely heard it himself. Staring into Brian’s face, he realized that that which he initially interpreted as confrontation, was, in fact, despair. Brian was on the verge of a mental breakdown – more so than Angie and probably even more than Casey himself.
“I have them too, man…”
Casey didn’t need to ask. He knew what Brian meant.
“The dreams. The yellow rooms. I also felt Dove there…”
The lunch lady yelled again.
“At first, you think the wallpaper has just an ugly, outdated print…”
Casey felt nauseous.
“But that’s no print –”
Brian’s face was so close, his freckles were out of focus.
“– they’re cries for help, scratched into the walls by the people who are stuck there.”
“Boys!”
Brian and Casey jumped as if a shotgun had been fired next to their ears. They scurried out of the cafeteria with mumbled apologies. Casey and Brian were in different classes, so Casey ran to his as fast as he could, ignoring his friend calling after him.
Casey soldiered on through the rest of the school day, pretending to be attentive during class and purposefully avoiding his friends. Once he got home, nothing he did, be it homework or gaming, made daylight diminish fast enough – and that’s because, for the first time since his friend passed away, Casey looked forward to going to bed.

Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Hello?”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Hello? Is someone there?”
Casey focused on steadying his breathing.
“Yes.”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Case? Casey is that you?!”
“Yes, Dove, it’s me.
“Casey! Oh, thank god you’re back! You have to get me out of here!”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Where are you?”
“I’m in the Backrooms.”
Casey fought to keep his thoughts aligned.
“Look around. What do you see?”
“Yellow. Everything is yellow.”
That confirmed it. Neither Casey nor Angie or Brian were going mad. Dove was indeed stuck somewhere, and it was not beneath the earth, in a narrow, rectangular box.
“Everything is so yellow…”
“Dove, tell me more. What else can you see?”
“Rooms everywhere. They never end, it’s like I’m running in replay…”
“These rooms, where are they?”
“I… I don’t know.
“Stay with me, alright? I need you to concentrate! Where were you before? Before the Backrooms?”
“I don’t remember.”
“How did you get there?”
“I don’t remember.”
“Can you remember something, anything? A face, an object, something!”
“I don’t remember! I don’t know!”
“Is there somebody else with you?”
“…”
“Dove?”
“Not somebody.”
“What do you mean?”
“It’s something. Something is in here, with me… I can’t see it, but it’s here. It’s playing with me. Watching, following.”
Casey felt his consciousness slipping in.
“Casey… you have to get me out of here. Say you’ll get me out of here!”
“But I don’t know where you are.”
“I’m in the Backrooms!”
“Dove, that’s not helping! Come on, focus! You keep calling them the ‘back’-rooms, not just ‘the rooms’. You know something, now help me out here! Where are you? Where are these Backrooms?!”
There was silence. Lucidity was coming down hard and Casey never thought he’d dread waking up from one of these nightmares.
“Dove! Where are the Backrooms?!”
And Dove answered.
“Everywhere. The Backrooms are everywhere.”
Casey was not drenched in sweat when he woke up. His sheets, on the other hand, were ripped to shreds.
* * * * * *
Two more months had passed since Dove died and, for the first time since her funeral, it was raining.
Casey remembered the sounds made by the raindrops hitting the lowered coffin and mistaking them for scratches. He still had the nightmares every once in a while, but since the night he tried communicating with her more, the intensity of Dove subsided. Also, he began having normal dreams again. Dove’s pleas would morph into grunts and mumbles, and the nightmare would melt into a halfway muted soundtrack for another dream, one that provided both sound and imagery. It was like Casey’s subconsciousness was slowly yet surely winning the fight against these nightmares, allowing him to sleep soundly again.
Casey’s friends were doing better too. Angie began to smile again and she and Callum resumed showcasing their teenage affection during breaks or outside of school. Brian also seemed to be doing better. Casey and he never brought up the dreams again and judging by his much healthier appearance, Brian probably stopped having them altogether. Karina was Karina: heart of gold, shell of rock. Nobody could accuse her of not grieving the loss of her friend, but she was the first to recover after Dove’s passing and gave nobody a reason to worry about her emotional well-being. All in all, the five of them were doing fine and even though moving on was still ways ahead, they were on the right track.
There had to be a logical explanation for the semblance of their dreams. More than likely, Angie, Brian, and Casey had seen the same movie or read the same piece of fiction a long time ago, thus triggering similar brain activity in their heads when Dove died. Karina might have had dreams about Dove too. Callum, as well. Karina’s parents probably did too, but that didn’t mean that they must have spotted some inexplicable crack between life and death – that would have sounded a million types of stupid.
Casey was too old and too smart to believe in paranormal nonsense. Dove was dead, but he wasn’t. He would miss her greatly, but this was the first day of the rest of his life and he planned on living it to the fullest, just like his best friend would have wanted him to.
It was Friday afternoon. Casey and his friends were going to meet up at Karina’s for a game of DnD. They hadn’t played in ages and thought that it would be cool to pick it up again. Casey had gotten home from school, showered, ate, and just as he finished brushing his teeth, his phone vibrated with an incoming message. The message was from their group chat – probably Callum asking which flavor Cheetos to bring, or a photo from Karina, showing off the setup she installed.
Casey opened the message and dropped his phone with a scream. The screen cracked, but nothing else was affected by the hard fall. The phone vibrated again. And again. And again. It sounded like a chainsaw against the bathroom tiles. Casey himself had fallen and crawled on the bathroom floor until his back hit a wall. He began to sob. The phone kept vibrating from a plethora of incoming messages, all from a number that was supposed to be inactive and stay inactive forever.
Dove was messaging the group chat in all caps. The first message had been a haunting picture full of yellow. Casey’s fragile inner peace, the one he fought so hard to regain after the nightmares subsided, crumbled. He got himself off the floor, grabbed his still vibrating phone and dashed out of the house, fully forgetting to lock the door or grab his bike.
Casey ran through the rain to Karina’s house like his life depended on it. The muscles in his legs were screaming and his lungs were burning, but nothing mattered except the phone that was still vibrating furiously in his pant pocket. Once he reached his destination, Casey dashed through the front door, completely forgetting to greet Karina’s parents, and flew up the stairs to where his friends’ room was. Everybody was already there, seated in a circle on the floor.
“Did you guys see them?!”
Everybody froze. Casey was soaked to the skin and looked like he was about to hurt somebody.
“We have to help her! I’m serious! She’s stuck there, we have to find her and get her out of there! K, I need your laptop!”
Karina frowned. Brian, unsure of what to do, pointed to the laptop on Karina’s writing desk. Casey wasted no time in closing the Spotify playlist and typing ‘shaman’ in the google search bar.
“Does any of you guys know what she means by “Backrooms”?! I asked where they are and she said ‘everywhere’, so I’m thinking, it’s a state of mind or something? But, how can it be, if she’s not alone in there and the walls are scratched, like, what are we missing here?”
Casey turned to face his friends. All four of them looked dumbfounded.
“You alright, dude?” Brian got off the floor and took a tentative step in Casey’s direction. “You need a towel, or–”
“No, I’m not alright! Check your phones, people!”
The four of them rummaged through their pockets in search of their phones. They all looked at their screens, then at each other.
“What are we looking for, exactly?” Callum sounded genuinely confused.
“Somebody commented on my latest Instagram post, but I’m pretty sure that’s not what you mean.” Angie turned her phone to provide evidence for her statement.
Casey was on the verge of losing his mind.
“Guys, are you fucking kidding me?! It’s Dove! Dove sent us a million messages in our group chat just now!”
Angie shivered and Callum threw a protective arm around her frame in an instant. Brian and Karina were livid.
“Casey…” Brian spoke with the tiniest of voices. “Not cool, dude.”
“Yeah.” Karina sounded angry. “Whatever you’re trying to do, you need to stop. Right now.”
“People, do you hear yourselves?!” Casey snatched his phone out of his pant pocket and tried unlocking it. Nothing. All the screen hat to offer was a spiderweb on black glass.
“Aw, shit!”
Casey scanned Karina’s room and rushed to the plug that had her phone charger in it.
“It’s not working! What the fuck, this piece of shit worked fine just seconds ago!”
Casey almost tackled Brian.
“Unlock your phone and give it to me!”
“Casey, you really need to calm down.” Nevertheless, Brian did as he was told and handed Casey his unlocked phone. Casey pressed the icon for their group chat and stared for what felt like an eternity to the last message, posted around the time he was brushing his teeth: Callum had sent a photo of the Cheetos aisle with the caption ‘which one?’.
“Bastard… you deleted them…”
“What?! Deleted what? And did you just call me a–”
“Angie, I need your phone!”
Angie was a step ahead of him, however – as were Callum and Karina. All three of them shoved their phones into Casey’s face, showing a message identical to the one on Brian’s phone from their group chat.
There was a knock at the door.
“Karina, is everything alright?”
“Everything’s fine, dad, just give us a minute.”
Casey’s heart was shattered.
“Why… why would you guys do this… she posted a picture of her surroundings and she finally found a way to contact us! She needs us, we need to get her out of those rooms!
Casey turned to Angie.
“They’re yellow, Ange, just like you said! Yellow and never-ending.”
“Okay, enough! Back off!” Callum rose to his feet. “Angie finally got rid of her insomnia from this bullshit, you are not bringing that up again!”
“Karina, I’m coming in.”
Karina’s six-foot-four tall father stepped into the room, looking every bit as angry as his daughter. Karina’s mother was right behind him.
“What’s going on here?”, the mother inquired.
“Casey was just saying goodbye to everybody.” Karina’s voice stung like frostbite. “Weren’t you, Casey?”
Casey felt his eyes water. He bit his lip and in a last attempt at tugging at his friends’ heartstrings, he turned towards Brian.
“Tell them.”
Brian was so white, he almost glowed.
“Brian, tell them. Tell them what you told me. The rooms, the yellow walls, the scratches… tell them!”
Brian shook his head twice and shrugged.
“Sorry, dude. I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Something within Casey collapsed. Without another word, he went to get his phone and walked out of Karina’s house with apologies he didn’t mean.
* * * * * *
Casey’s retinas stung. Blinking was difficult. The world was asleep while he surfed the blue fluorescent lights of digital worldwide knowledge, searching for something that might make him get to his friend.
“What color does yellow symbolize? On one hand yellow stands for freshness, happiness, positivity, honor, and joy, but on the other, it represents cowardice and deceit.”
Not helpful.
“What is the spiritual meaning of yellow?
Personal power and fulfillment, abundance, courage and self-confidence. Yellow represents happiness, clarity and sunlight.”
If that were so, Dove, wherever she was, would have been fine.
Casey considered stealing his mom’s credit card because he knew that the money he saved up wouldn’t cover the things he needed to buy: an EMF reader, a thermal camera, maybe a Ouija board. Google was not all helpful, though. Casey found interesting articles and clips with and regarding people who survived clinical death, but finding these people on social media was a different process altogether. The ones he did manage to find, had ridiculous privacy settings. Casey couldn’t speak to anybody who might have seen ‘the other side’, so he was just as blind as in the nightmares with Dove.
Casey yawned. He tried starting his phone one last time, but it remained unresponsive. He wished he could have had a better look at the picture of the Backrooms. Maybe he could have spot something Dove missed. Maybe he could extract it out of his phone somehow, upload it somewhere and do a reverse image search of it. And if that didn’t work, well.. he wasn’t the world’s best artist, but he could throw together five lines in an attempt at recreating it, and ask Reddit for clues. He would try anything, no matter how ridiculous.
Casey yawned again and knew that is was time to go to sleep. He shut off his computer, got into bed, and closed his eyes.
Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Hello?”
Casey opened his eyes and sat upright. He was alone in his room and still very much awake.
“Dove?”
He looked around but saw nothing.
“Dove, are you in here?”
Casey got out of bed and looked under his desk, under the bed, and in his wardrobe. He even opened the window to see if there was somebody outside. Nothing. Casey got into bed again and closed his eyes anew.
“Dove, can you hear me?”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Yes! Casey, oh thank god, I thought you left!”
“No, I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Casey was not asleep. He knew that for a fact. He still couldn’t see his friend, but he could hear her as if she were right next to him. That was good. It meant less trouble for him to get a hold of her.
“It was so hard to reach you lately, where were you?!”
“I’m sorry, Dove. But I’m here now and I won’t leave you again.”
“Help me, Casey.”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Help me!”
“I will, I promise! I think I came across something that might help. Look around, Dove, can you see–”
“Will you get me out of here?”
“I don’t know, but I’ll try. Look for a–”
“Case…”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“…Casey… my Casey…”
“What, what is it?”
“Do you love me, Casey?”
Casey swallowed the lump in his throat.
“Yes.”
“Will you get me out of here?”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“I’m trying, Dove, but you really need to–”
“Shhh… no more trying. You tried enough, I now need you to do. So, will you? Will you get me out of the Backrooms?”
Casey remembered Angie’s pathetic eyes, glossy from the tears that were about to happen. He remembered Callum acting up in front of the girlfriend who was out of his league, making her feel like she needs him. Casey remembered Karina’s self-importance and shitty attitude. Last but not least, Casey remembered Brian… dumb, quiet, treacherous Brian. And in the midst of all this, was Dove. Smart, strong, beautifully ungraceful Dove.
Brian’s voice echoed in Casey’s head: “Sorry, dude, but I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Yes.”
“Yes?!”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch
“Yes.”
“Say it! Say it, please, I need to hear it!”
“Yes, I will.”
“No, Casey!” Scratch scratch scratch scratch “I need to hear you say ‘yes, Dove, I will get you out of the Backrooms’!”
“Yes, Dove –”
Scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch
“– I will get you out of the Backrooms.”
The scratching stopped. Dove began to cry.
“… thank you.”
“I got you, Dove, don’t worry. We’ll do this together. Now, look around, can you see a light switch anywhere?”
Silence.
“Dove, focus. A light switch, can you see it?”
Silence.
“Dove?”
Casey opened his eyes and the first thing he registered, was light. Casey squinted, wondering if one of his parents heard him talking to himself and came to check on him, but then his eyes adjusted…
And the first thing he saw, was yellow.
“No…oh no.”
Rooms, beyond rooms, beyond rooms, in what had to be the most haunting color in existence. Casey got up on wobbly feet and felt dread expanding to every cell in his body.
“Dove…?”
But Dove was no longer there.
Which is not to say that Casey was alone."	9.73	40.0	Lucretia Vastea	05/28/2020
There’s Something Wrong With My Daughter’s Treehouse	"It took me nearly three months to build this mansion of a treehouse for my daughter. It had slides and swings, windows and doors, ladders and steps. It had it all. Shit, I even insulated it and had power outlets, heating and cooling. This monstrous structure was a beautiful mix between a full-fledged apartment and a McDonald’s play place. I was incredibly proud of it, but I must say that it fully solidified the truth in her words whenever my wife told me that I sometimes way over-do things. Truth be told, it only made her more right since our daughter was only four years old.
By the time I finished building the treehouse there were only a few nice days left in the fall before the snow hit, and my daughter only got those few days to play outside and in my creation. Even though I did install heating in it my daughter wasn’t a big fan of going outside to play in the snow unless we turned it into a big event to go sledding somewhere. This was slightly disappointing to me but she was only four so I understood.
When the snow melted, and the temperature climbed again she was out there playing in it almost constantly. This made me happy to see how excited she was with what I made for her. For about a week it was even difficult to get her to come back inside to eat and sleep. There had been a couple of nights I had to go out and drag her back in the house for bath time and bed. It was times like these I was happy I had made the treehouse big enough and sturdy enough for me to venture up there. It was plenty big enough that was for sure, I had made the inside twelve feet by sixteen feet with an eight-foot ceiling. I secretly had planned that size so that if for some reason my daughter didn’t like it I could just turn it into a cool sort of man cave.
A month went by with her out there spending nearly every waking moment playing either inside or on the swings and slides. Then, one day, in the middle of the afternoon, my daughter ran screaming out of the treehouse and into the house.
“Daddy! Daddy! I don’t like it!”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, little one, what’s wrong?” I said as she barreled into my legs nearly causing my knees to buckle.
“My treehouse! It’s scary!”
“Seriously? It’s been your favorite place for months, why is it all of a sudden scary?” I asked with a little more annoyance in my voice than I intended.
“I saw a scary man in there! He was hurt!” she said.
“Wait? What did you say? Is there some…just stay here.” I commanded as I ran out the door and toward the treehouse.
As my hand touched the doorknob at the top of the steps my heart jumped for a second and the thought of how dumb it was charging inside with no real plan if there truly is someone in there. Still I turned the handle and burst into the room of the treehouse.
Nothing. Various toys and Barbies on the floor, a kiddie couch, and a couple of small beanbag chairs were the only things in the room. I’d like to say that I searched the place, but that was literally it. There wasn’t much searching, as it was all one big room… so, search complete. I saw no man inside hurt or otherwise save for myself. I walked back out the door and back into the house. As I walked through the back door I found my daughter in the next room over sitting patiently just watching the back door with her thumb in her mouth.
“Who is he?” she said to me as soon as she saw me walk through the door.
“Who is who? I didn’t see anyone out there. What did he look like?
“He’s gone?” she replied, completely ignoring my question and running past me back outside.
What the fuck just happened? I thought to myself as I watched her climb the steps and enter the treehouse from the kitchen window.
I mentioned the odd experience to my wife a little later that day. She seemed only slightly concerned, and we both chalked it up to her exceptional imagination. That night as we sat eating around the table my wife began to ask our daughter about what had happened.
“Daddy told me you saw someone in your treehouse today. Did they ever come back?”
“Um, no.”
“What did the man look like? Do you know how he got into your treehouse?”
“He was scary. His mouth looked weird, and looked like he had lots of owwies in it.”
“Do you know how he got in the treehouse?” I chimed in, wondering if I was going to need to upgrade the security around the house.
“I don’t know. I just was playing on the swings and then I came in to play with my toys and he was there.”
“So, he was already hiding in the treehouse?” my wife asked.
“No, he was hiding like in here,” she said, pointing to her head.
My wife and I locked eyes at the sound of this and both let out a sigh of relief assuming that it meant it really had been her imagination. Everything went much more smoothly and calmly the rest of the night.
We went another week without any thought or mention of the situation. Regardless of the lack of hearing anything more about it I still felt uncomfortable and the day after I decided to move the back-yard security camera, pointing it at the treehouse as best I could. Sadly, with how much my daughter played back there I wouldn’t be able to set the motion detection on it without it sending alerts every five minutes.
In the middle of the second week following the unusual afternoon, my daughter again ran into the house screaming about a man in the treehouse again. This time I immediately ran out to the treehouse and bursting through the door I was again met with nothing more than an empty room. Frustrated and annoyed at the situation I turned and began to leave the treehouse. Just as I passed through the doorway, behind me I heard a crack and a thud as if something had been knocked over or broken. I spun around and looking through the doorway from outside the treehouse I saw nothing. I thought to walk back in and check a second time, I really wish I hadn’t.
As my foot crossed the threshold of the door back into the treehouse everything changed. The light from the sun coming through the windows vanished. Rusted steel and concrete surrounded me and everything was bathed in an ominous deep red glow. An overhead light flickered and popped giving me only quick random glimpses of the horror I was now surrounded by. Nearly every surface looked like it had been coated in a thick layer of sticky half coagulated blood. Chains hung from the ceiling and ended with the same hooks you would imagine at a slaughterhouse. A rusted steel table sat against the wall with various crude rusted tools on it. The place sort of looked like an abandoned warehouse or meat locker of some sort.
A clank rang out behind me and I turned around, half expecting to see the doorway out into my back yard. I didn’t see the door I was hoping for, but I did see a massive man, nearly seven feet tall, who looked to be solid muscle. He was shirtless but covered in scars. With the dim and flickering light, I couldn’t tell if he was black or just completely covered head to toe in dried blood. The lips of the goliath were missing and its teeth had been ripped out and replaced with rusted nails, screws, and razor blades crudely inserted at odd angles into its gums, and blood seemed to constantly run from the nightmarish dental work. A giant scar ran down its face and large stitches using what looked like thick yarn or twine drenched in blood held both the scar and one of its eyes closed.
The large man raised its arms out to its sides, and I noticed that huge nails and screws were also sticking out of its skin in random locations. Blood dripped from each place a nail or screw had been protruding from his skin. He lowered his head as his arms became stretched out fully from his shoulders and let out a strained and wheezy attempt at a yell. I guessed that its vocal cords had either been severely damaged or removed. I could see rage rise in its one good eye as it began to run toward me.
“Oh, shit! What the fuck?!” I yelled as I turned and ran as fast as I could.
The dim and flickering light caused me to slip and stumble over hooks and chains lying on the floor that I had not noticed before. The man let out another wheezy yell as it chased after me. I screamed and ran.
Stumble and roll.
Scramble to my feet.
Scream and continue running.
I hit the wall clumsily when I tried to look back to see how much the creature had gained on me.
It was getting closer, and closer.
I ran and felt along the wall just trying to find my way in the nearly perfect dark that I had been surrounded in. the huge behemoth of a man was getting closer and closer. Finally, I found it, a door handle, or a crash bar really. I slammed into it and luckily it burst open and I fell through the doorway.
Quickly I scrambled to my feet and as I stood fully up and began to run, I realized I was outside. I was once again in my back yard.
“Holy shit!” I exclaimed breathlessly, looking back at the treehouse, my heart pounding furiously inside my chest.
My brain had insurmountable trouble in trying to comprehend what had just happened. Was it a hallucination? Some sort of waking stress-induced nightmare? I couldn’t truly grasp what I had seen or what I had just gone through. I walked cautiously back into the house a constant feeling of uneasiness flooded my body. My wife standing at the back door saw the look on my face and asked if I had seen anything in the treehouse. I nervously chuckled at her choice of words but not knowing how to explain I just told her no I hadn’t.
My daughter wanted to go back out the next day and I refused to let her go out there alone. When we got out there, I stepped through the doorway first, telling my daughter to stand back and wait for a second, nothing happened. I stood just inside the doorway and let my daughter enter while I scanned the room looking for anything out of the ordinary. She seemed completely unaffected as she walked in and instantly began playing on the floor with her toys. As I saw this, I decided to merely shrug off my previous experience as my own temporary psychosis.
I try my best to not be an overprotective parent, and I don’t believe in the paranormal, but I can’t get the images of that afternoon out of my head. It makes me wonder if there is any truth to it or if there is truly something wrong.
A few days later I was standing in the kitchen loading the dishwasher and I heard a scream radiate from the back yard. Worried and confused I looked over to confirm that yes, my daughter was still in the next room playing. Nervous, I opened the back door and began to walk toward the treehouse. Not wanting to enter the structure, I called out from the ground.
“H-hey? Is s-someone in there?” I stuttered with anxiety.
No reply.
“Hello? Is there anyone there?”
The only response was another scream. This one was much less woman-in-pain and much more guttural-demonic-beast.
“What the…” I mumbled under my breath but was interrupted by another scream. This one back to sounding more like a woman in pain.
Upset at the idea, I realized I was going to have to go up in there to get any answers. My body trembled as I forced myself up the steps, my brain screaming at me in reluctance to enter. I held my breath and closed my eyes as my hand grasped and turned the handle to the door. I opened the door and after a few seconds, exhaled, and opened my eyes. There was nothing. It was just as my daughter had left it a few days ago.
“Holy shit, I am completely losing my mind,” I said to myself as I stood there looking through the door into the essentially empty room. “I really need to get my shit together; this is getting embarrassing.”
I turned to walk back into the house and the corner of my eye caught something inside the room. I looked back and recognized a small stuffed pink squid lying on the floor next to the couch.
“Dammit child, I told you not to bring your stuffed animals out here,” I said to myself under my breath as I began to walk in to grab it.
Again, as I stepped through the doorway the light faded. The red glow and flickering light returned, and screams bellowed out around me. Excruciating, horrific screams of pain filled the air. I was back in that hellish warehouse once again. My first thought was to run for the door again but looking in that direction it was gone. The place that held my escape was now nothing but flat, blood-covered concrete wall. Anxiety and fear rose in my throat as another scream flooded the room and I looked around to find its source.
On a table in the middle of the room lay a woman, the giant of a man was on top of her straddling her. Her chest and ribs had been cut and ripped from her body exposing her organs. A huge rusted knife was stabbed into the side of her neck and I had no idea how it was possible she was still alive let alone still screaming. The man was taking handfuls of her intestines and pulling them from her body. He was wrapping her organs around himself and stroking himself with them. He looked toward the sky and with his mouth gaping, released a loud, guttural yell that vibrated the room. After a few strokes he would throw the chunk of intestine or other organ across the room. It would splat as it hit the wall or floor and he would grab another handful and rip it from her open chest. Completely frozen in shock at the horrific sight I watched as the woman’s head turned toward me and screamed again, you could already see the vacant look of death in her eyes. Just as she looked toward me, a chunk of stomach flew in my direction and splattered against the ground near my feet. He grabbed her heart and ripped it from her chest, lifting her entire torso off the table before the arteries snapped and her lifeless body slammed back down. He yelled out again as he brought himself to orgasm and shot a black tar into the open blood-filled cavity that had been the woman’s chest.
I nearly passed out from the pure shock and disgust but instead I snapped out of my trance and began to run. Not sure where to go, I just knew I had to get out of there. Again, tripping and stumbling over various things on the ground I found the wall on the opposite side of the room far from the light. I began to feel around in total darkness for a door. I heard a yell and turned back, in the dim light I saw the goliath of a man bite into the woman’s flesh with his rusted screws and nails for teeth then flip the table over. He yelled out again, and just as he looked like he was starting to look for me I found a door. I pressed and slammed against the door, but it just wouldn’t open. The failed medical experiment of a man heard my attempt and started toward me. Panicked, I slammed harder and harder into the door, still to no avail; it just wouldn’t budge. He continued running at me, getting closer and closer. I took a few steps back and threw my body into the door. Still, there was barely any movement. He got to me and tackled me into the door. The door broke free from the impact as we both slammed into it. He disintegrated as we fell through the doorway, while I fell backward down the steps, landing on my back in the grass of my back yard.
My body filled with pain I slowly got up staring at the open door in utter disbelief. I stood staring for what felt like an eternity before my wife came out and asked me what was wrong. I did my best to explain the horrific images as best I could, and once I was done she ran back into the house yelling something about having a plan.
My wife is the much more superstitious one of the two of us, so she decided to call a “friend” that would know what to do. I had no idea what was truly going on so I reluctantly agreed to have this crystal-wielding hippy witchdoctor visit our house.
A few days later she showed up, and I say “showed up” because after pulling into our driveway she refused to get out of her car, opting to call my wife from the driveway. My wife put her phone on speaker so I could hear the conversation.
“Something is very wrong here!” she said. “I feel a presence stronger than I’ve ever felt before.”
“Well, can you come and burn some sage or something to get rid of it?” my wife said.
“No, absolutely not. I’m not leaving my car. I need to go, and you should get a hold of someone else to clear that evil spirit from your property,” she replied.
“Can you come in the house and talk to us? It seems to only be in the treehouse in the back,” I said, trying to get as much time for answers as I could.
“No, it’s not. I’m sorry,” she said just before ending the call, and we watched her drive off, away from our house.
“What was that supposed to mean? What do we do now?” I asked my wife.
“I don’t know. That was the only person I could think of.”
“Well, at least there will be no more playing in the treehouse, okay?” I responded.
“Yeah, I’ll look online for someone else to help,” she said as she walked off toward the office.
“Sure. I’m going to go block the door to the treehouse so she can’t just wander in there,” I said, walking toward the back door and motioning to upstairs where our daughter slept.
Avoiding it all together seemed to work well enough. I was disappointed at not being able to use what I had put so much work into, but it had been a month since we had any problems with it, so… oh, well. During that month, my wife had messaged and called numerous people she found on the internet, trying to get at least an explanation for what was happening in our back yard. In spite of her effort, however, the results were the same. Most of the people never responded, some refused to help or even investigate, and the ones she got to come to the house did the same as the first lady. They either refused to come inside or just drove past without stopping at all.
Finally, I grew weary of it all and told myself that it was all bullshit, and that there was nothing actually wrong. I went out to the treehouse and unblocked the door. I took a deep breath and walked inside.
Nothing.
I was perfectly fine. A few spiders had made some impressive webs inside, but other than that, everything was fine.
“Ha! See? I fucking knew it!” I yelled out.
Just to prove it to myself, I walked over to the doorway and jumped back and forth across the threshold a few times, with no effect. Hell yeah, I was right! It was all in my head, I thought to myself as I walked back inside.
“It’s fine. I told you it would be okay,” I said to my wife as I walked in. I then told her what I had just done out there and she did nothing but give me a concerned look.
“I really don’t think that was a very good idea. What if you just pissed off whatever it is?” she said.
“Oh, whatever, there’s nothing out there. It was all in my head. I’ll prove it!” I replied overconfidently as I began to walk back outside.
When I got back out to the treehouse and up the steps to the door I looked back at my wife standing, staring at me from the back porch.
“See? Nothing!” I said just before walking through the door.
As I stepped through everything changed again. The darkness was back, along with the haunting red glow that seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The chains with hooks suspended from the ceiling held decayed, naked bodies this time. A few of them swung back and forth as if someone had just run into them as they walked past. Every one of them had its chest torn open, with their organs either missing or spilled out onto the floor. From the far side of the warehouse room I heard a scream, followed by the groans and yell of the massive demon of a man I had run into the other times.
“Oh, fuck,” I whispered to myself, realizing I had seriously messed up.
The smell of rot and decay was overwhelming. I nearly threw up as I pushed past the bodies, making my way toward a wall and what I hoped was some sort of doorway out of there. Each time I pushed against one of the hanging bodies, something would fall from them. Various body parts and organs fell out or broke off, hitting the floor with thuds and splats. The sound made me flinch every time.
For what felt like an eternity, I slowly made my way through the maze of bodies, before at last coming to an opening. Unfortunately, I had traveled in the wrong direction, straight toward the beast. I could see it between two of the swinging corpses. It looked… different this time, as though it had grown at least a foot taller. It appeared larger in every regard, including all the rusted nails and screws, which seemed to have grown to the size of long, sharp railroad spikes. Its muscles, now completely oversized, bulged and dripped with blood, both his own, where the various wounds where spikes impaled his skin, and that of his victims. His jaw had become more pronounced, and the rusted screws and razor blades he had in place of teeth were much bigger. He also now had large, bloodied, rusted metal horns resembling twisted rebar jutting from the top of his head.
I caught the horrified look from the man lying naked on the table just before the beast grabbed his skin at the top of his chest and ripped it down and away from his body like tearing off a shirt. The beast looked toward the sky and dangled the skin over his face letting the blood drip all over him before dropping the skin into his mouth and swallowing it whole. The man on the table began to scream in pain but his cries were cut short as the beast leaned down and bit into the man’s throat. Somehow still alive and alert all the man could do was sputter blood from the gaping wound where his throat used to be. My heart felt like it was going to burst through my chest it was beating so hard and so fast. I couldn’t have held my eyes open any wider in terror. All I wanted to do was look away and run but the horror of what I was seeing rooted me to the spot and I felt paralyzed.
The beast roared in the man’s face and then began to bellow a deep and haunting sound I could only describe as some sort of demonic laugh. It got louder as it again looked toward the sky and after a few seconds it suddenly snapped its head back down and ripped both arms from the man’s body at once, sending arcs of blood flying through the air. It threw one arm off and into the darkness and took a huge bite out of the other before also throwing it away. The man, now having no way to make any noise, just sputtered more blood from his throat in response to the pain. I watched on in shock knowing I really needed to get the fuck out of there as the beast leaned in and seemed to study the man’s face. The beast’s thick black saliva dripping onto him as he held his gaze mere inches apart.
Another roar exploded from the creature’s mouth and my shock suddenly broke. I began to move as quickly and quietly as I could through the bodies in the opposite direction desperately looking for a wall or door. The sound of ripping came from behind me, and shortly after I was hit in the back by part of a leg with a huge bite taken out. There wasn’t much of the man on the table left, and I knew that meant I was very quickly running out of time before he would be looking for someone else to put on that table next.
Now covered in blood and viscera from pushing through all the corpses I finally made it to a wall. Sadly, I found no door and began to run down the wall, my fingers slid along it hoping to feel a door. In my panic I ran straight into another wall as I came to the corner of the room. As I hit the wall with a loud thud and fell back another roar emitted from the center of the room. I stood back up, and, placing my hand on the new wall, began to run down it, my footsteps making so much noise as I panicked. I heard chains begin to swing and I knew that the beast was on the move.
“Shit, shit, shit!” I mumbled to myself as I ran.
I smashed face-first into another wall, another corner, and still no door. Standing back up again I turned and made my way down the third wall. My face and body hurt so badly from slamming into two walls without even slowing down. As I ached, I ran, my fingers still sliding along the wall. I felt the wall shake and a roar erupted through the air. The beast must have just slammed into the same wall I was running along. Not thinking it was even possible my panic rose even higher. Then I felt it, a door frame, I stopped suddenly and felt all around it. It was another crash bar handle, and I stepped back and kicked with all my might at the bar. My heart raced as I began to just barely make out bodies on chains in the red glow, swinging as something was tossing them aside as it came directly for me. I kicked at the crash bar a third time and the door flew open, as if someone had opened it from the other side before my foot made contact. The force of my kick caused me to fall forward through the suddenly open doorway, and I tumbled down the treehouse steps, landing in the grass.
My wife let out a scream as I flew through the doorway and ran to me as I hit the ground at the bottom of the steps.
“What the fuck just happened?! And why are you covered in blood? Are you okay? Should I call the ambulance?”
I looked down at my body and she was right I was still covered in all of the blood and guts I had picked up pushing through all of the hanging bodies.
“Fuck this!” I exclaimed as my wife helped me to my feet and I hobbled off to the garage.
My wife stood at the bottom of the steps staring up at the door to the treehouse as I returned from the garage carrying a gas can. I told my wife to move out of the way and to grab a lighter as I started pouring gasoline all over the treehouse as best I could without stepping inside again. I poured half of the can everywhere I could reach and threw the other half, can and all, through the doorway and into the treehouse. Still not really knowing what was going on, my wife stood in the grass holding a box of matches, and as I returned to her side, I took them out of her hand.
I struck one match and dropped it back in the box. The rest of the matches lit as I threw it up onto the top of the steps next to the door. We stood next to each other and watched as the treehouse quickly turned into a raging fireball. It was nearly just a pile of ash and scorched earth before the fire department was called and showed up. When they did arrive, I held them back making sure there would be nothing left of the treehouse.
That was nearly a year ago now. In that time, grass has grown back over the charred spot in the yard where the treehouse once stood. The fire marshal had lots of questions about what had happened, but I just told him I must have put in some bad wiring that caused the fire. I don’t think anyone would have believed me anyway if I told them what really happened with it and why I did it.
It’s been peaceful around the house since that all went down, but my daughter ran up to me a few minutes ago. She was yelling about a scary man in her toy room. I’ll buy her new toys, but I’m going to go call the moving company. We’re leaving."	9.31	13.0	Trevin Nichols	05/24/2020
The Clacking	"I think the proudest moment of my life is when my son found the treasure on his Scouts’ Geocache Weekend in the Woods; my worst moment is what I found at the same time.
Jacob had been excited since the first moment his troop announced they were going to be doing this.  He had never been the most confident kid in the world, but when I signed him up for Scouts, he took to it so naturally you’d have thought he was a born leader.  He was made captain of Red Team, and along with all the other captains, he was allowed to take home the tablet they would be using to mark the coordinates from the treasure hunt, and practice with it.
They would not be assigned coordinates right away. Each team would be assigned a clue, and the answer to the clue would be the coordinates to the first box.  The box would contain a small reward for each team, as well as the clue for the coordinates to the next box.  This box would then lead to the third and final box, which would contain the grand prize for the winning team.
There was a lot of speculation as to what the third box held. Some lowballed and thought it was just a new badge for the winning team, some thought it was a trip to a museum or pizza shop.  Jacob thought it would be a cool camping tool, like a compass or something similar.
Me, I didn’t bother trying to figure it out.  My job for the day was just to watch the team, along with a few other parents, just to make sure nobody cheated.
The Saturday we all went out to the woods was a misty and grey late spring morning, cool enough still to wear a light jacket (which I was), but it promised to heat up as the day went on.  My son was as ready for things as he could possibly be, having spent the last few nights practicing around the house, making his own clues and locating every crayon he’d asked me to hide away somewhere.  He was pretty good at it, and I was hoping he and his team would win.
While the Scout troop leaders got the groups together, handing out colored jerseys and serving up juice boxes and small bags of snacks, I looked up as far into the woods as I could see.  The mist made things hazy a few hundred feet out, and the hilly terrain didn’t help things much.  I hoped the GPS systems worked really well, because it wouldn’t be good to see any kids go missing.
Once all the teams were corralled and the rules explained for the last time, the first clue was given out.  All the teams dived into a huddle and started working on them.  I listened, but obviously couldn’t give any hints.  Not that the Red Team needed them; Jacob’s practice paid off and they wasted no time getting the first clue sorted out.  They were already on their way into the woods by the time the other teams had written down the first number.
I and three other chaperones followed along, watching to see how they did.  They walked up into the woods, Jacob leading the way, arriving at a clearing slightly up a hill with a large rock in the center.  As he neared the rock, the tablet started beeping, the app on it acting like a metal detector, getting louder and faster as he moved closer to the right spot.
There, in a small crack in the rock, was what looked like a plastic bag.  Jacob pulled it out, and the team crowded around, seeing what was inside.  Inside the bag was a box, and inside the box was a clipboard for them to sign, along with a couple of baggies filled with Sour Patch Kids.  They took one of the bags, signed the clipboard, and put it back where they found it.
The second clue was inside the bag of candy, and this clue was a little harder to figure out than the last one; they needed about ten minutes before they got the answer.  I already saw Green Team coming up the ridge towards them, so they had to hurry if they wanted to get the next clue in time.
The second box was found in a picnic area, underneath a trashcan near the restrooms.  This one had another clipboard, several boxes of trail mix, and the third clue.
With Green Team hot on their heels, they needed to work fast.  I thought they were going to be stumped, but then Jacob looked at the clue and shouted, “Wait!  That last one… I think I know where that is!  It’s by Benchley Cave!  Get our stuff. We’ll put in the numbers as we go!”
Benchley Cave wasn’t so much a cave as a small rock formation that went into the side of the hill by about fifteen feet.  I remember going there as a teenager near dusk with my girlfriend at the time.  There was a custom at the time to throw something in there for somebody to find later (some things grosser than others).  We never did; before we could, we got kicked out by rangers who said they didn’t want us starting trouble, or fires, or something.
The other parents and I followed after Jacob and his team, reaching the flat area where the cave was located.  He wandered up to the cave entrance, but the beeps got colder there, so he moved on.  I guess actually putting it inside the cave would have made things too obvious for the last location.
Turns out it was even trickier than that… there was a flat rock that the kids had to lift and discover a dug out hole where the box was located.  Once they did, the cry that went up had all of the adults there clapping.  Red Team had done it, and with plenty of time to spare before any other team was even there.
Before we even opened the box, the boys wanted us to take their picture, smiling and posing with the sealed container.  I took as many as I could, but reminded them they had to open it and sign the clipboard if they wanted to make sure they won fair and square.
The box opened.  The clipboard was signed, and the last baggie was opened to reveal… movie passes.  Generic movie passes, good for free admission to a Saturday morning show.
The other kids were ecstatic, but I could tell Jacob was a little disappointed.  He’d wanted something a little more worthwhile than a movie pass. To be honest, I thought they could have done a little better myself.
The other teams arrived and signed the paper, and before they could act jealous of Red Team the Scout leader told them they’d be having a picnic right here, by the cave.
As the hot dogs and burgers were getting warmed up, I saw that even though Jacob was playing with his friends, he seemed a little down.  I figured it had to do with the prize, but I didn’t know what I could do to cheer him up.
Then it clicked; I wondered if people still kept up the custom of throwing something into the cave.  The kids weren’t allowed to go in, but I was pretty sure nobody would mind if I disappeared in there for a few minutes.
For something the size of a living room, the cave still got dark toward the back, and the gloom of the rainy day didn’t help much.  I shook my cell phone to turn it on, and shone it down on the floor.
I almost lost my grip when I saw what was on the floor.
There were a few things in the cave… a wallet, a watch, a few coins, an old switchblade… but then there was another object, along with a smear of blood.
I thought maybe about calling the police, but the closer I looked, it was clearly not a human injury. The skull sitting in the midst of the dried blood was animal in shape, but nothing I had ever seen before. I don’t even know how it could have been attacked, and by the looks of it, eaten right down to the bone, since it had predatory jaws and long, sharp teeth.
I would have hated to run into the thing when it was still alive, but it was still incredibly fascinating to look at. If it was some undiscovered animal, it would be something truly unique.
It would certainly brighten Jacob’s day.
I lifted it out of the dirt.  It seemed stuck for a moment, but after a little work, it pulled free.  I turned it around, studying it.  The skull itself was pretty clean, save for some blackened bits stuck to the bottom, and it wasn’t bloody despite where it had been sitting.
I took off my jacket and wrapped it up before leaving the cave with it over my shoulder.  It was warm enough that it wouldn’t look strange to anyone, so nobody would think I was walking out of the park with anything.
I waited until we got back into the car and drove out of the park before I handed Jacob my jacket, which he unfolded and revealed the skull.  He was a little spooked by it at first, but when he asked me what it was and I couldn’t tell him, his attitude changed.  Suddenly he wanted to know what it was, and told me he wanted to look it up once we got home.
He and I spent quite some time looking up stuff on the internet, the skull sitting next to the computer monitor in his room, but we still came up dry.  Not even sites talking about Bigfoot and other ‘cryptids’ (a word I didn’t even know until that day) showed anything like what we had found.
I began to wonder if maybe we had stumbled across a movie prop, or some kind of hoax…. a very weird and pointlessly elaborate hoax, but a hoax.  I couldn’t help thinking that wasn’t the case, though… it looked and felt like bone, even if we couldn’t figure out what it came from.
We finally gave up for the night and decided that we would have dinner, and he could tell Mom and his older sister everything that happened that day on the geocache hunt.  I couldn’t have even tried to keep him quiet, though he didn’t talk about the skull… that was just for us until the time was right, I guessed.
I was doing some spreadsheet work in my home office that I got stuck with over the weekend when Jacob came to my door, pale.
“Dad, there’s a weird noise in my room.  Can you check it out?”
Jacob wasn’t the kind of kid to make up excuses to stay up late or get attention, but even as I got up to take a look, I didn’t quite know what kind of noise to expect.
We went into his bedroom, and as soon as we went in, I could hear it… a slight clacking noise, like a castanet, but quieter.  I looked under his bed, opened the closet, even checked the floor for a water pipe issue, but found nothing.
Then it got louder.  Something in the room was definitely making the sound, but neither of us… could…
The skull.  Jacob gasped at the same time as I noticed the slight motion in the jaw.  The sound was the teeth snapping together, lightly, but growing ever stronger and louder as we stared at it.
It had to be a movie prop.  Nothing dead could move like that, not without help.
The teeth became even more animated, the clacking growing louder and louder.  I moved toward it, seeing if maybe I could find a cord to wrap around it to get it to stop until we could find the off switch.
As I grabbed it, there was a sound at Jacob’s window.  The blind was closed, but the window was cracked open to let the night breeze in.  I told Jacob to turn off the light so I could what might have caused it, hoping to tell him it was a bird, or a tree branch, even though there was no tree outside his window.
When I lifted the blind, what greeted me was a dark, hulking shape, fingers already forcing their way through the screen into the window.
I slammed the window shut as hard as I could and ushered Jacob out of the room.  My wife came out of the bedroom asking what the matter was, and when I told her to lock herself in and call the police, she called Jacob over and closed the door.  I heard her lock click, and then I heard Jamie, our oldest, locking her door, too.
I closed Jacob’s door, but with no lock on this side, I couldn’t do anything here to keep it out.  I then realized I still had the skull in my hand.  I dropped it, ran downstairs, and went into the kitchen to find a knife to protect myself.  I had told my wife to call the cops, but the cops didn’t seem like they were prepared for something like this.
I had found a butcher’s knife in the silverware drawer when I heard the clacking again.
I went back to the living room, where the skull lay, toppled over, having fallen down the staircase, now lying in front of the fireplace.
I heard something shuffling from the chimney.  Looking around quickly, I saw the hall closet a little ways away, and I jumped in.
I watched through the crack in the door as that blackish stuff on the bottom of the skull grew into a small, tentacle-looking mass, placing the skull upright again.  It started clacking and jumping like crazy and a large… thing slithered down the chimney, unrolling itself into a shape roughly seven feet tall.
That was all I wanted to see, but I couldn’t look away as the thing came closer to the clacking skull, grabbing it and…
It placed it back on its body, right where the head would be.  I now realized it had been headless when it came down the chimney.
I nearly vomited as a squelch came as the tentacles reattached itself to its neck, and slimy flesh began to regrow on its surface.
I shut the door all the way, knife at the ready, hoping it did not go upstairs, that it would stay here and leave them alone.  I had taken the skull, after all; if it was mad, it would be my fault.
I didn’t have long to wait as the closet door flew open, and it stared at me with its bulging eyes.
Its ragged, fleshless lips.
Its horrible breath.
And its scream of anger.
I thrust the knife forward.  It screamed again, but as I pushed forward, I felt a sharp pain in my side, and I blacked out.
I awoke in the hospital.  I had a large wound in my side, heavily bandaged, but I was also greeted by three very happy faces.  My family was okay, and Jacob held my hand.
Nobody else but me had seen the attacker, so nobody knew what really came into our house that night.  I just said it was some crazy guy, and he attacked me with the skull before making off with it.
My wife and daughter believed it.  But Jacob didn’t.  He didn’t see the attacker, but he knew about the skull and what it was doing.
My side is now healed, from what I can only assume was some kind of claw or bite from when I had rushed it, trying to defend myself while terrified but what came after me.  And I still am.
See, I’ve been trying to find a way to put my home on the market.  I tell my wife I just don’t feel safe in the neighborhood, but she insists the kids have all their friends here, and if we just buy a security system (she suggests PanOptics, I’m not so wedded to them), we should be okay.
But she doesn’t fear what I fear… that it may come back someday.  She didn’t see those eyes, to know what it was capable of.
When I go to sleep, I think I can hear clacking.  I pray it’s just my imagination.  I just hope someday it isn’t coming from under my bed."	9.27	11.0	Seth Paul	05/16/2020
Sire	"I keep hearing them crackling; I can’t see them, but I hear them. At first, I thought it was just a distant wolf howling or my imagination playing up, but now I’m certain that they’re here — somewhere amid the trees — maybe watching me, maybe not, but aware of me nonetheless. Them hags are aware of everything that goes on in these woods and I love ‘em for it in spite of myself. Their presence makes these nightly camping excursions more interesting, I’ll give them that, but I wish I could drag my nice soft bed out here with me. Sleeping on the rooty ground with nothing but a few wooly blankets and a little tarp tent gets really old, really fast. One day, the devil will take me for the things I do for the girls. Until then, my aching body will do the complaining every morning.
I’ve played out most of my life in these woods, alongside the things that dwell within it. I’ve lived in fascinated fear of them most of my life, which is funny considering that I started out being enchanted by them. Bone truth is, deep down, I miss them in a strange way. I think about them every day and wonder what would’ve become of me had I stayed on with them. I suppose it’s only natural; man’s a curious creature.
I knew they was running around in the woods since I was a boy growing up in a rickety wood cabin on the edge of the trees. We had a small farm consisting of one donkey, ten chickens, two goats, and a cow. We also had a big old hound dog who couldn’t herd for nothing but was a darn good watch dog. If anybody came anywhere near the house, old Hank would start barking like he was possessed.
Hank saw them before I did, or sensed them anyway. As far back as I can remember, Hank would stand guard right on the edge of the woods line. He’d stare real fixedly and snarl and growl… not just at nighttime either. Even in broad daylight he couldn’t look into the forest without being on high alert. I reckon they was sneaking around even then—probably had been for over a century by that stage — but I only recall seeing glimpses of them here and there. My very first recollection is seeing one staring out at me from behind a tree. She was old and withered and raggedy and sharp-faced; glaring at me with coal-black eyes. I’d screamed and cried for my momma and she reassured me that it’d just been my imagination. We were on our own out there; we had no neighbors and town was about an hour’s walk each way. Surely, there couldn’t possibly be no woman in the woods. Momma then turned all angry on my pa and blamed him for telling me the story of Hansel and Gretel and the scary old witch. She said he’d put ideas in my head. Truthfully, he just allowed me to put a name to what I’d been seeing long before I ever heard that old fairy tale: witches. Them things in the woods were witches.
Back then, I didn’t know exactly where the coven lived, but I knew they wasn’t far away, and they had a real fascination with our farm. We’d often lose chickens during the night. Mostly they just disappeared but a few times, later on especially, some blood and feathers would be left behind as if in ritual.
Pa said it was foxes, but he never sounded none too convinced of that. Looking back, I reckon my father was well aware that bad things lurked in those woods. My momma did too; she’d get all jittery if we was outside and she heard as much as a twig snap. I don’t know if she ever got a glimpse of one, but she never missed as much as one Sunday church sermon. I suppose all that praying was her way of seeking protection from a threat she couldn’t describe or explain. My folks might’ve had their suspicions, but they ain’t never said nothing to me. Of course, they didn’t have to say anything to me. I knew more than anyone else because I had seen more than anybody. Those hags had a fancy for me from day one.
They was always lurking around the woods, but when I was five, they got bolder and started staring in at me from the window. If I had the poor luck of waking up in the middle of the night, I’d get a nasty shock when I looked over at the window to see several of those raggedy women staring in at me, grinning. I woke up screaming more nights than I can count. Momma blamed the fairy tales but I knew them women were as real as the moon. The old hags could move fast too; they were always away from the window when my pa and momma burst into my room.
To be honest, not all of them were hags. Some of them were young — and later several were beautiful, which is really how the whole mess started in the first place — and occasionally they seemed kind and friendly; more akin to angels than witches. I was about four the first time I really took notice of the one who called herself Blythe. She looked to be only a few years older than me and she had a soft smile. At night she’d come to the window closest to my bed (she always seemed to know when I couldn’t sleep) and we’d make funny faces at each other — she standing outside and me lying in bed — until I got sleepy enough to doze off. Sometimes she’d hum lullabies to me… just loud enough for me to hear but she never woke my folks.
I liked being an only child and when I found out my momma was expecting I was none too pleased. I went up to the window the night I found out and I tearfully told Blythe about how I didn’t want no brother or sister. She nodded at me with sympathy in her eyes and took my hand in hers. She listened close, even though she didn’t say nothing. Blythe was as quiet as a spider. I was elated a little while later to hear I wasn’t gonna have none, although I was sorry to see momma laid up in bed crying. I understand now that she had — and then kept having — miscarriages and she didn’t know why… although I did. I’d willed it without even understanding that I’d done so.
I was twelve going on thirteen when the Civil War started. I was too young to get called up and my pa was too old so we just continued life as if nothing was wrong; our neck of the woods saw no fighting and the soldiers didn’t descend on our little town, neither. I suppose you could say we was real lucky, or we had a little extra “protection.”
As the war raged on around us, near but distant, boys only a little older than me was losing their lives every day. As for me, I kept my life but gave my soul to something much worse than soldiers.
Blythe was the start of it, of course, as I always knew she’d be. Her visits to me had become more frequent and they wasn’t only confined to the nighttime anymore. It had started when she took to peeking at me from the woods, in broad daylight, as I did my daily chores. Now, they’d always been there, creeping and peeking, but Blythe got close. She wanted me to know she was there. Hell, she was my friend.
I was about seven when our kinship initially started up and over the course of the following five years, we took to playing hide and seek and tag whenever I could sneak away. As usual, Blythe never spoke a word; I don’t think she could. Her sisters — I suppose that’s as good a thing to call them as any — could speak, rave even, in my language and tongues far older, but Blythe was mute. She was also beautiful and seemed to grow up right with me, except lovelier and lovelier the older I got.
When I was twelve, I started to notice her piercing blue eyes, jet black hair, and magenta lips with increasing interest. She was lithe yet curvy in all the right places. When I was thirteen, I went down to the river to get some washing water for my momma who was having one of her bad spells, a day when she did nothing but lie around the house. That happened more and more after she started losing all the babies. Anyway, while I was down at the water, Blythe crept out of the woods. I smiled at her, thinking she was just gonna stand on the shore and stare at me like she so often did — she never helped me with the chores — but instead she descended into the water, way past her knees, up to her thighs. In the process of doing so, she lifted her skirt high enough to give me a full view of her long legs. I stared and she stopped and looked right at me. She smiled coyly and then she giggled — which was the most noise I’d ever heard her make when she wasn’t humming some strange tune — splashed some water in my direction, and darted off back into the woods, leaving me standing there by my lonesome and wishing (yearning) for more of her legs and laugh and company.
I saw her again two days later and that’s when she offered me the apple. A rare sort of red, savory and juicy; I can still feel it on my lips. I suppose that was the day of my indoctrination, since my absolute obsession with Blythe started then. I thought about her constantly, even dreamt about her, and as if she knew it, she started getting flirtier with me. She would still meet me in the woods to play like we had when we was kids — or when I was a kid and she looked like a kid — but she started flashing her legs at me more… Well, at first it was her legs but, over time, she let me catch flashes of other, more intimate parts of her, too. Always from a bit of a distance, mind you, she wouldn’t ever stand still long enough to let me touch her — not as if I’d the nerve to begin with, mind you — but she’d taken to touching me whenever she could. She’d jump out at me from behind the trees and stroke my hair, or run her palm down my chest — which drove me wild even with my shirt on — and she’d even reach out and squeeze my leg on occasions when we was sitting next to each other. But if I tried to touch her, she’d stand up and run off into the woods, giggling like the tease she was.
She was driving me crazy and it only got worse when she started bringing her friends — or sisters, or whatever the hell they were — with her. One was more succulent than the next. There was the busty blonde named Anne who wasn’t shy about complimenting me and looking me over in a way that made my heart hammer in my chest. Joan was a brunette with black eyes that were as pretty as Blythe’s blues, and she was the really touchy-feely one. But no matter how much they surrounded me and fawned over me and hand-fed me impossibly fresh apples and grapes, they never let me get too comfortable, and they never let things go as far as I wanted. And whenever we was out in the woods together, I’d always spy other shapes creeping about; the old ones lurking. I suppose they were spying on us, making sure all went according to plan.
I’d become so enthralled by the woods that I started neglecting my chores. On a few occasions, I’d wandered home late and my pa had given me a heck of a belting while my momma screamed and cried and begged him to stop. She was disturbed by how thin I’d grown; I hadn’t been eating on the regular. My only appetite at the time had nothing to do with food.
Hank, the dog, went first. My pa and I found him all ripped up on the edge of our farm. My pa thought it was a fox, but I thought the slashes looked more like claws or talons — like a lady’s fingernails — more than teeth. I can’t say I was angry; I couldn’t prove them women of the woods had anything to do with the old dog’s death and it was one less mouth to feed.
My father went next; then my mother. Both were taken by fever. They came down sick without me noticing too much at first — I was mighty distracted most days, after all — but when I saw them sicking up and feverish, I instantly ran to the woods. I screamed for Blythe and the others and I begged them for help; I somehow knew they could make potions. Yet I was just calling into the trees. No one came. I thought I’d been forsaken and walked home feeling sick and panicky… only to find a pretty green glass bottle at my doorway. Relief washed over me like rainwater. See, I still loved my folks dearly and I would’ve done anything to save them. I made sure both my parents drank from the bottle and then I took a swig from it too. I don’t know why I did, I wasn’t ailing none, but it just seemed like a good idea at the time.
It was sweet yet it had a sharp aftertaste. I ain’t never tasted nothing like it before or since but I ain’t never forgot it or what it did. As soon as I swallowed it down, I felt completely relaxed and at peace with everything, which is pretty goddamn weird considering both my parents were dying, but I slept like a baby that night. Within a fortnight both my folks had passed on but I didn’t cry or make any fuss at all; it’s like I was incapable of feeling sadness. I calmly walked outside in the light of day and started digging two graves. I had no desire to alert the town or set up a church Mass… My parents had been happy living on that farm for nearly two decades and they’d be happy staying there for eternity.
As I was digging, I heard branches crack behind me. I turned around and saw Blythe standing there, her big eyes looking at me not with sympathy, but with a kind a longing — a yearning — that I ain’t never seen in her before. Anne and Joan followed close behind her and all three of them helped me finish the burials and mark the graves with rocks. Then Blythe, who was still my favorite of all, took my hand and pulled me into the woods with Joan and Anne following. Them two was giggling but Blythe was just smiling. Back then I thought her grin was soft and sweet, but looking back now I realize that there was something wolffish right under the surface.
That was the day my life either began or ended, depending on how you look at it. It was certainly when things got weird, though.
Blythe led me by hand through the woods to a cabin that was nestled between a grove of trees and a mountain rock. They took me inside and gave me another sip of something — this time out of a blue bottle — that sent my head spinning in the nicest possible way.
They led me to a tub of nice warm water, which was a rarity back when I was sixteen, and all three of the young ones stripped me naked before scrubbing me down with fresh soap and getting all the dirt and grime off my skin and outta my hair. Blythe was just smiling, but Anne and Joan were commenting on how nice and muscular I was. After my bath, they dried me off with a towel as soft as velvet and led me to a nice soft bed. Each one of them took turns making me a man. I was happy Blythe went first because she was special, although as I watched her face contort in pleasure I couldn’t help but notice that it was changing, altering… At times it looked like she was about a thousand years old, which should’ve disturbed me, but I was too wrapped in euphoria to startle.
And that’s how things went for some unknown length of time. I stayed lying in that bed all day, drinking their potions and eating their food, sleeping soundly entwined in their plush blankets with my head resting on their soft pillows, and making love to the young ones every night. At first it was just Blythe and Anne and Joan, but then there were others, and I couldn’t keep track of anything… and I didn’t care that I couldn’t.
I was aware of the older women being around. They looked like hags, but they cooked well and didn’t try to mess with me so I didn’t mind them. Occasionally, I’d have a nightmare about sharp-toothed, gaping-mawed, demon-women chasing me through the trees and I’d wake up in a cold sweat, startling all the girls (coven) lying around me. Then they’d give me a swig of one of their potions and it would all go away and all would be well again.
Occasionally, I’d come out of my pleasure-stupor enough to notice that some of the girls’ bellies were extending; swelling like pumpkins in autumn in a way that could only mean pregnancy. They were growing my children inside of them. That realization initially horrified me so much that I physically recoiled and let out a little scream. They laughed and surrounded me and let me feel their bellies — something was moving inside them, but it felt more like a festering nest of ants than a baby — as they poured more of that sweet potion down my throat and sent my hazy head back into oblivion.
As blissfully out-of-it as I was back then, there are some things I recall. I suppose the war was still going on ‘because I’d occasionally hear the sound of lost soldiers roaming around the woods. The ladies would throw a blanket over me to keep me (their treasure) warm and hidden (safe) before leaving the cabin. I’d sometimes just be able to make out vague voices; conversations that went from chatter to panic to screaming. Afterwards, the ladies would use the scraps of their uniforms to sew themselves new dresses — and prettying the garments up with shiny brass buttons and the occasional ring — and one of the old hags would cook up a nice meaty stew and share some with me. Over the years, I can’t count how many times I’ve had a hankering to taste that delicious meal again.
Other times I’d hear babies crying or gurgling. Some sounded right, like what I assumed a human child should sound like, and others didn’t. The crying always stopped, sometimes by itself and somethings after I heard a good hard sickening THUD, but it always stopped eventually. Then I’d see the ladies busying themselves around the caldron, brewing up a skin cream that made them all look younger (fresher), even the old ones.
Other times, I’d catch glimpses of the women nursing babies at their bosoms. Anne and Joan used to do it right in front of me but they wouldn’t never let me see the children’s (my children’s) faces. I got a feeling they kept the girls only; they was replenishing the coven. I have no idea how long their kind lives — because I’m now certain that there ain’t nothing human about them — but some of the older ones had to be close to the end. Perhaps that’s why they needed me.
Blythe’s belly never grew. Even though she visited me in the bed most often, and most tenderly, she never grew my seed. I have no idea why that still makes me a little sad — given the horror of what was happening to those (my) youngins’ — but it does. Blythe’s special to me, always will be.
A few times a year, which I now reckon to be the two equinoxes and solstices, they’d leave the cabin and descend into the woods. I was so curious one night that I decided to follow them. I had to gather my strength to get out of the bed and my legs and feet felt cramped and sore since I hadn’t been walking in a while. I spied them just beyond the tree grove, all of them dancing stark naked around a big bonfire. I wasn’t able to take my eyes off them even though I was scared that they was gonna see me and get mad and crack my skull open like they’d done to most of the babes. Yet after about an hour, Blythe did spot me and did nothing but smile. Later, they all led me back to the cabin and Blythe loved me to sleep while Anne and Joan lounged nearby, lulling a sweet song in a language that only their kind could understand.
And so that’s how it was for years; maybe as long as a decade or more. I lived every young man’s fantasy and probably would’ve kept on doing it if they hadn’t evicted me.
It wasn’t as harsh as it sounds. I always figured that when they got tired of me, they’d simply kill me and eat me like they did to the soldiers and the occasional band of runaway slaves who had the misfortune of crossing the cabin’s path. Yet Blythe had other ideas. Although she never spoke, she was somehow the most commanding of them. Hell, for all I know she’s the oldest and is just real good at masking it. One day, when I was a grown man with a full beard and fuller belly, she dressed me, and helped me off the bed, and led me out of the cabin. We walked hand-in-hand out of the woods in much the same way that we’d walked into it so many years before. She brought me back to my childhood home. My parent’s graves were overgrown, the stones covered in moss, and the barn was barely standing, but a rush of memories came at me nonetheless.
I told her I didn’t want to stay here. I begged her to go back to the cabin (coven) and the warmth of her bed (body) but she shook her head firmly. She handed me a pouch full of sand — or what normal folks would mistake for sand — and pointed outwards towards the farm and the trees and what lay beyond them. Without one word uttered, I’d been given my instructions, assigned my fate. I would’ve compiled regardless, but I’m mighty glad that she saw fit to give me one final intimate kiss before she slipped back into the woods and disappeared among the trees.
It was strange going back to town. A lot had changed and most folks didn’t know me and assumed I was a hobo or a drifter; I hadn’t shaved in a while. Pa had been a poor man, but a savvy one, and he had saved some coins in a mason jar that he’d buried under the porch. I dug it up and had just enough in pocket to get a wash and a shave, some food and a paper. The old feller behind the counter at the general store seemed to recognize me, although he didn’t say nothing. It took me a moment to recognize him since, when I’d been there last, he was a man of thirty or so and now he looked like a granddaddy. I sure as heck ain’t aged that much. Whatever the girls put into those potions clearly worked.
The paper said there’d been a war, not the Civil War but another one, and now a third was brewing. The country was in trouble, everybody was poor. Money men in New York City were jumping out of windows and out west there was some awful freak of nature going on called the Dust Bowl. It sounded more like a hex or a spell than anything natural, but of course I didn’t say that to nobody. In fact, I didn’t say one word to nobody then, and haven’t much since. I’m sure my conversation skills are well and truly lacking.
With my foray into town over, I went back to the farm and spread the sand (ground baby bones) all over the edges of my property. I knew damn well it was a protection spell; a long-lasting one at that. I saw how the world was changing when I went into my once-sleepy village; people riding around on machines rather than horses and women wearing outfits that showed off more of their physiques than my momma woulda thought proper… and the town was bigger, a LOT bigger, than it had been when I was a boy. It’s only a matter of time before more people come and then folks start walking around those woods.
And Blythe knew it.
We can’t let nobody find them… or me. I’ll start fixing up my homestead, although I reckon I’m about eight decades old I don’t feel or look more than thirty-five or so. I can do it. The work will put muscles on me, just the way they like it.
If the coven needs a place to run to (sanctuary), I can provide such safety. And it’s not just because if I fail, they’ll tear me limb-from-limb and use my parts for potions — which they would, but that’s beside the point. There’s a reason I built that old farmstead back up. There’s a cause behind me camping out yonder every night just to hear the cold-comfort of their calls and rustling. There’s a method behind my unending diligence to their preservation.
I protect them, because that’s what patriarchs do."	9.64	11.0	Meagan J. Meehan	05/13/2020
Do Not Go Outside	"“Do not go outside! Ignore all cries for help, no matter how human they sound!” shouted Alex’s dad. He pulled the cellar door over and paused to look back. “And lock this door behind me.”
The door slammed shut. Alex locked it, walked down the stairs and stood alone in the darkness, moonlight shining through a crack under the door. The basement was freezing cold. She looked around the room. Nothing but junk. Toys from her childhood, broken furniture her dad had refused to throw away, stacks of books and newspapers, and her grandparents’ old possessions.
She rummaged around and found her grandfather’s recliner chair. Well, somewhere to sit, at least, she thought. Alex dragged an old bike out of the way and pushed the chair toward the middle of the floor. She searched through a chest of her grandmother’s belongings. Inside were a collection of porcelain figurines, some knitting needles and a hand mirror. Alex picked it up, wiped some dirt away and looked at her reflection. Over her right shoulder, she saw a blanket and some cushions stashed underneath an old photo album. They stank and were covered in dust. Everything was – but it was better than sitting there freezing. She reclined on the chair, wrapped the blanket around her and tried to sleep.
Alex was startled awake by something banging against the door. She pulled the blanket up towards her head and sat motionlessly. The banging stopped. As she was beginning to calm down there was a gentle knock. Maybe it’s just the wind, she told herself. Then came another knock, much louder than the first. There was a knot in the pit of her stomach. She tried to stay calm and told herself over and over that it was the wind, but was so unnerved she retreated toward the corner of the basement and took cover behind a nearby cabinet.
“Hello?” cried a voice opposite the door.
Alex’s eyes widened. She crouched even further behind the cabinet.
“Hello? Is… is there anybody there? Please… I… I really need somewhere to hide.”
The voice was faint and Alex could barely make it out. The knocking once again became a loud banging.
“Please, if anybody’s down there, I need help!”
Alex’s mind was racing. Who is this person? Why do they need help? Should I let them in? Her father’s warning echoed in her mind: ‘no matter how human they sound’. What did he mean by that? Alex noticed the moonlight shining through along the bottom of the door. Maybe if I get close enough I can see who it is, she thought.
She walked slowly to the middle of the room, past the chair and toward the stairs. Alex was so fixated on the door she tripped on a pile of books and crashed to the ground, knocking over the bike and a stack of newspapers.
The banging stopped. “He-hello? Is someone there? I can hear someone moving down there. Please, you have to let me in.”
The voice was much clearer now, but there was something peculiar about it. It sounded cold and emotionless. Neither male or female, nor young or old.
Alex moved to the bottom of the stairs, and eventually summoned the courage to speak.
“H-hello?”
“Please, yes. Hello, you have to help me! Can you let me in?”
Alex didn’t know what to do. The voice sounded desperate, but her dad’s warning was clear in her mind. She was too nervous to get any closer.
“Y-Yes. I’m here. But I’m not going to open the door for you.”
“What? Why? There’s something horrible running around out here. And if you don’t let me in it’ll get me. I’m in great danger. Please, open the door. Quickly!” cried the voice.
Alex felt a sense of dread overcome her. “What do you mean something horrible is out there? Who are you?”
“Look, there’s no time for that now! I’m in danger now! Why won’t you let me in? Won’t you help me?” The voice was getting angry.
“I – I won’t.”
“What? Why?”
“Because earlier my dad warned me not to open the door to anyone.”
“That doesn’t make any sense. Please, just let me in.”
The banging against the door started again.
“What’s out there? Why are you in danger?”
“Open this damned door! Now!” the voice growled.
The banging stopped, and the gentle knocking started again. Alex was so scared she couldn’t speak – and she didn’t know what she would have said if she could. She didn’t want to antagonize whoever it was outside any further; it sounded like they were furious. She looked at the crack beneath the door and had an idea, that perhaps if she climbed the stairs and crouched down, she’d be able to look underneath. Maybe she’d be in a position to see the person outside and what they looked like.
She ascended the stairs quietly and crouched beside the door when the knocking stopped. She froze for a moment in uncertainty, before lying down and peering out. There was nothing. All she could see was the back garden. She let out a sigh of relief. Maybe they were gone? She had just turned to walk down the stairs when there was another loud bang against the door. Alex jumped in fright, forced to grab the railing to keep herself from falling.
“Please, I’m begging you! Let me in!”
The banging continued. Catching her breathe Alex crouched down to look outside again. She still couldn’t see anything. No feet, no legs, no… anything. She saw nobody under the door, yet someone was furiously banging against it, begging her to let them in. Alex fought the urge to cry.
“Please, I know you’re there. I’m in terrible danger! How can you just sit there and not let me in?”
Alex faced the door and tried to regain her composure. She had an idea. As the voice continued to plea for help, she crept down the stairs and opened her grandmother’s old chest. She grabbed the hand mirror and returned to the door.
“Please, please, please!” the voice begged, as the banging continued.
Alex lay flat on her stomach and nervously pushed the mirror toward the door. She tilted and slid it around, trying to see as much as possible. No matter what she did, Alex couldn’t see anyone. The pace of her breathing quickened and she began to feel a tightness in her chest.
“I am not opening this door. Before he left my dad warned me not to open it for anyone. I don’t know who you are, and I don’t know why you’re here. You shout about needing help and being in danger, but you won’t explain why–”
“But I told you, there’s n–”
“And besides, I can’t see you underneath the damn door. You’re hiding somewhere. I can see the back garden through that slit under the door with my mirror, but I can’t see you. If you just want help, then why are you hiding?”
She pulled the mirror back and stood up. The voice began to laugh.
“You’re smart to keep the door shut. Your dad was right to warn you.” The voice sounded calmer this time, nearly whispering.
“What do you mean? Who are you?”
“I wasn’t lying before… There is something horrible out here.”
“You’re just some maniac trying to scare me.” Alex turned to walk back down the stairs.
“Oh, really? Put your mirror back down and have another look.”
Reluctantly, with a hand on the rail, Alex crouched down and peered through the crack again. Nothing. Her hand was trembling.
“You’re still hiding. Why d–”
“Closer,” the voice said softly.
Alex got down on her front and slid toward the door, straining to see as much as she could in the mirror. She could barely keep her grip.
“Almost there.”
Pausing for a moment, Alex took a deep breath and pressed her head as close to the door as she could. Then, sounding as though it were mere inches in front of her, the voice whispered, “Hello.” Alex screamed in fright as the mirror was ripped from her hands and pulled away from her.
She screamed again, and the voice started laughing. This was followed by more banging, faster and with more force than ever. Alex raced back down the stairs. She crouched down behind the chair, stared at the door and burst into tears. The banging kept getting louder; the cellar door sounded as though it was breaking apart.
“I’m not letting you in! Go away! Go away!”
On the verge of hysteria, Alex collapsed behind the chair. After taking a moment to regain her composure, she stood over the chair and took a deep breath.
“Wh-what are you?”
The banging stopped.
“What difference does that make? You know I’m out here and you won’t let me in.” The voice sounded amused.
“Tell me what you are!”
“It would be much easier to show you. Why not open the door and I ca–”
“No!” she screamed. “Tell me what you are! Tell me why I can’t see you!”
The voice laughed and started banging on the door again. Alex climbed behind the cabinet, pulled the blanket over her head and covered her ears with her hands. She rocked back and forth until she was calm enough to lie down. The banging turned into a gentle knocking, and then grew fainter and fainter, until at last it stopped completely. She tried to calm herself down and steady her breathing. She lay in silence for what felt like minutes – or maybe it was hours – unsure whether she was awake or asleep. Then there was another knock at the door, less violent than before.
“Alex. Alex, are you there?”
It was her father’s voice. She crept out from behind the cabinet, looked at the door, and saw sunlight shining through.
“Alex, it’s Dad. Alex, are you there? Please, please, tell me you’re alright.”
She leapt out from behind the furniture and looked at the stairs. Under the door, she could see the shadow of her dad standing outside. Alex let out a sigh of relief and raced up the stairs.
“Dad! Where were you? There was something outside and it was trying to get me to open the door.”
“Alex, honey, thank God you’re safe. Come, open the door. We have to get out of here now.”
She undid the lock and burst through the door, ready to hug her dad and let out a cry of relief.
“Dad, I–”
Alex looked around in confusion. She couldn’t see her dad anywhere. The garden was empty.
“Dad? Dad?!”
She was overcome with terror. Alex ran back into the basement, slammed the door shut and bolted the lock. She shot back down the stairs and stood quivering in the middle of the room. She frantically looked around, making sure she was alone. Some books collapsed from the pile in front of her and she screamed. Just some books, she thought as she tried to catch her breath. Feeling a sense of unease, Alex climbed back beneath the cabinet and pulled the blanket over her head.
There was a gleeful whisper.
“So nice of you to let me in.”"	9.37	19.0	Jordan B.	05/12/2020
A Family Walks Home	"It was late evening. The sun was dipping in the sky, but the dark had not claimed the night just yet. Lynsey did not agree with keeping the kids out that late. The next day was a school day after all, but Sam had persuaded her that she should let them go to the meal. Sam’s cousin had just published a book and so the family got together at their favorite little restaurant to celebrate. One of Sam and Lynsey’s kids had fun, the other did not.
Emily was 13. She was at that tender age where no matter what she was doing, the last people she wanted to be with in public were her parents and her little brother. She had sat in the corner of the restaurant as they served the food, glued to her phone and smirking at private messages her friends were sending. Her little brother was five years younger. The difference between Will and his teenage big sister might as well have been a chasm. He loved being around Emily, but an eight-year-old did not provide much entertainment, so she shooed him away any time he came near her or her phone.
The only time Emily looked up from her phone that evening was when her grandfather made a quip about the town’s past. The family had been there for generations, going back at least a few hundred years. That was a point of pride with them. But while the members of her family were chatting about the historic traditions of the town, Emily and Will’s grandfather enjoyed reminding everyone that the town was a dark place. In his 80s, the grandfather started off with a smile describing a murder that had happened when he was a boy. Lynsey interrupted her father-in-law before the details became too gruesome. Sam laughed.
After the meal, Sam, Lynsey and their two children wished the extended family well and headed back home. It was only a 15-minute walk or so, and though Will complained about having to walk, Sam had wanted a beer with his meal and so refused to drive. Lynsey suspected that was his real reason for being so keen to attend his cousin’s celebration. Sam was not an alcoholic, but he wore the label heavy drinker with pride.
It was autumn and though winter was still at least two months away, there was a definite chill in the air. Colder than usual for that time of year. Lynsey held Will close to her side as they walked. Sam led the way, and Emily achieved the miraculous by negotiating the streets while almost never looking up from her phone.
“Did that murder really happen in our town like Granddad said?” Will asked.
Sam turned around with a wry grin, his footsteps echoing in the empty street. “Yup”
“Sam!” Lynsey drew him an annoyed look. “You’ll give Will nightmares.”
“Come here, buddy.” Sam lifted his arm. Will left his mother’s side and clung to his father’s instead.
They moved through the town streets. The sun finally lost its nightly battle and surrendered beneath the horizon. Darkness fell across the town, and with it came an eerie silence. As they walked, Sam continued to goad his son. “This town is full of gruesome stuff like that, Will.”
“R-really?” Will stammered, beginning to feel both the cold and his father’s stories weighing down on him.
Emily looked up from her phone for once. “Dad talks some amount of rubbish, Will.”
“Don’t talk to your father like that, Emily,” said Lynsey with a stern voice. “Even if it is true.”
“What sort of stuff, Dad?” Like any child Will’s age, he wanted the shadowy door of knowledge to remain shut, but could not help peer through the gap when it was left open by an adult.
“Well, the year you were born some kids were playing near the old quarry. No one saw them again. And just three years before that when we moved back here, I was out driving home one evening and hit something with my car.”
“A deer?” asked Will.
“If deer have jaws filled with sharp teeth and red eyes, then yeah. I reckon if I were smaller, say, the size of a kid, I’d have been a goner.”
“Stop it, Sam.” Lynsey opened her arms for Will to return to her, but he continued to hang on to his father’s side, entranced by the stories.
Sam looked down at his son’s frightened expression and laughed. “Nothing wrong with a good scary story. I loved them when I was a kid.”
“Will’s different, Dad,” said Emily. “You know he’s sensitive.”
“Am not!” Will shouted. Then his voice stammered again. “Did… Did you really hit something with teeth and glowing eyes, dad?”
“Yeah, damned thing then chased my car for a mile and a half. Don’t know what it was.”
“It… It doesn’t come into town, does it?” Will stammered again.
Sam looked down at his son and gave another gleeful grin. “I’ve heard rumors that a police officer went missing just a few weeks back.”
Will turned and looked back at his mother with fear flickering in his eyes.
“Sam, you’re frightening Will,” said Lynsey.
“Nah, I’m only joking. It never happened, Will.”
Lynsey let out a sigh of relief.
But Sam wasn’t one for giving in that easily. “To be fair though, the town was founded on some really horrific events.”
Lynsey sighed, this time with frustration.
“Don’t sigh, Honey. It’s true.” Sam pulled Will in closer to his side, pointing to the dimly lit houses and streets around them. “The town has been founded twice. The first time was by a religious group. They were a leper colony. When other settlers came in later on, they wanted to buy the land from the lepers as it was a great spot. The lepers refused. Then they conveniently disappeared.”
“Disappeared?” asked Will, his fear overcome by curiosity.
Sam nodded. “That’s what I was taught at school when we were kids. One day, for no reason, the lepers abandoned their settlement. Apparently for some religious reason, like the earth was bad around here. The new settlers then burned it down, built a church, and started afresh.”
“What do you think happened, Dad?” said Will.
“Maybe the town is cursed!” Sam let out a comically loud maniacal laugh.
“Sam! No more!” Lynsey had had enough. If Will was going to be up half the night, she would have to sit up with him while Sam slept off the drink.
“Okay, okay. It’s just an old story. It was so long ago it probably didn’t happen.”
“It’s getting cold,” said Emily, once again looking up from her phone, unamused by her entire family.
Sam looked to the night sky as a chilly breeze wandered down the street towards them “Yeah, I think it might rain. C’mon, I know a shortcut. Down this way.” He then led his family along another street and then turned to enter a long narrow lane.
Will stopped in his tracks.
“What’s the matter?” asked Sam.
“See, you’ve got him spooked with your stories!” Lynsey walked over to Will and put her arm around him, finally taking him away from his father. She spoke in a soothing voice. “It’s okay, Will. If we go down here we’ll be home in no time. I’ll make you a cup of hot chocolate before bed to warm you up. What do you say?”
Will looked worried.
“Is it your dad’s stupid stories?” asked Lynsey.
Will shook his head. “No, it’s another story I heard.”
Sam’s eyes lit up. “About this lane?”
“Yes. The big kids told me to stay away from it at night.”
“I haven’t heard that,” said Emily. “The kids are just trying to wind you up, Will. If it gets us home quicker, good. Besides, I’ve walked down here loads of times coming home and I’m still here, aren’t I?”
“After dark?” asked Will.
“You can be such a loser sometimes, Will.” Emily moved ahead of her family.
Lynsey peered down the lane, which cut into the night like a pointed finger. “It does look a little dark down there?”
“Now who’s freaking out our son?” Sam walked forward. “There’s nothing down here but trash and a way home. Come on!”
Taking Sam’s lead, they moved forward, though Will stayed nestled into his mother’s side. As they walked, the moon came out occasionally from behind black clouds which slowly edged across the night sky. There was no other lighting in the lane, except for the odd fragment of yellow coming from the houses on either side. But even that light was mostly blocked by tall brick walls at the end of each garden.
“Jesus, this place is a dump,” said Emily.
She was referring to the heaps of garbage and trash which lined the sides of the narrow lane. People had obviously been dumping bags of rubbish in it for some time. The occasional old television and carpet nestled between the piles of black rubbish bags. Sam joked about it being a good place to dispose of a body.
“I don’t like it here,” said Will quietly to his mother.
“Me neither, Honey. But we won’t be here long.”
The lane continued on, and Sam was joking about something or other when he stopped suddenly. “Did you hear that?”
“Stop it, Sam,” said Lynsey, her voice angry and tired.
“Wait…” Emily looked on, her head tilted slightly as she listened for something.
The town was still in silence, the occasional car off in the distance the only noise to punctuate the night. But then, there was something else.
“What is that?” asked Emily, finally putting her phone away in her pocket.
Will whispered. “There’s someone in the lane with us.”
The noise was like a rustling sound, though occasionally it sounded more like cloth being dragged on the ground through wet, congealed puddles.
“It must be someone putting out more trash,” Sam pointed to the heaps of rubbish on either side of them stacked against the garden walls. “Nothing to worry about.”
The family moved on, but as they did so the sound grew louder, until another sound came – the distinct chinking and rattling of a glass bottle being kicked by an unseen foot along the ground.
“Who’s there!?” asked Sam, loudly.
Will was now trembling. “We should go back.”
“We’re nearly out the other side,” said Emily, shivering in the cold. “It’s probably just a rat or something.”
Sam stopped as a shadow flinched nearby, only to join the darkness around it. “What was that?”
“I told you, a rat or something,” said Emily.
“Must have been a pretty big rat.”
Lynsey scowled at her husband. “Sam, if you’re trying to scare us again…”
“I swear, I saw something crawling about over there on all fours.”
“Let’s just get home…” came Emily’s now nervous reply.
“Yes,” said Sam, his voice unsure for the first time.
They walked on, their footsteps joined by the occasional shuffling sound which seemed to be following them down the lane from behind.
The exit was now in sight. Emily pointed to a bunch of garbage in the middle of the lane. “Christ, there’s a lot of rubbish around here.”
“Don’t blaspheme,” said Lynsey.
Sam placed his hand on Emily’s shoulder, guiding her. “We’ll walk around it.”
“I want to go home,” said Will.
“We’re nearly out,” Sam said as he passed the garbage on the ground. Up close, it was more a bunch of rags than anything else, oily and blackened with grime. There seemed to be nothing to them, until from within those rags a hand emerged. It reached out suddenly as if from nowhere and wrapped its fingers around Sam’s ankle. He screamed and kicked out. His family froze in disbelief as now another hand reached out, grabbing Sam’s knee and yanking him to the ground. It was hard to see the shape beneath the rags, but a ray of moonlight struck the left hand, revealing it to be blackened and rotten. Something shuddered from beneath the tangled mess of torn cloth.
As Sam’s family rushed to help him, a wheezing, choking cough could be heard in the night. Lynsey and the two children pulled on Sam’s arms trying to free him. The rags on the ground responded, hands and all, and climbed up Sam’s body like a cockroach. Now sounds emanated from around the family. Low guttural groans echoed out, as what they once believed to be garbage lining the lane walls revealed themselves to be huddled, shivering figures. The people from the shadows stumbled towards the family at speed. Will cried out as a sea of rotten hands reached around his mother’s face, thrusting their fingers in her mouth and yanking her head back. A loud crack was heard as bone and cartilage broke inside her body.  She gave a muffled scream before her cries were covered by bony fingers, and no matter how much Will clung on, he could not save her from the things in the lane.
Nor could he save his father, who was now obscured by the rags and hands on the ground, which shuddered as a single quivering mass as they fed upon whatever remained of Sam. Emily cried out for help, phone in hand trying to dial out. But the malevolence in that lane did not care for technology or fear it; the figures simply pulled Emily by the hair into the darkness, tearing at her flesh which flaked off from her bones like charcoal as she disappeared.
All Will could do was run. Being smaller than the others, he fled through the legs of one of the stumbling shadows. Its rags dangled across his face, smearing grime with it and releasing a stench of rotten meat. Will scrambled on his hands and knees underneath the crooked figure and then beyond. Stumbling footsteps followed him at first, but then diminished.
Will was found an hour later by a local police officer doing his rounds. The boy was covered in dirt, running wide-eyed and in a state of shock. No trace of his family was ever found, and it’s become a bit of an urban legend out that way. Kids tell the story of the lane and how no one should ever enter it after dark. “A family went missing down there,” is usually given as the reason.
As for Will, he was adopted by his Aunt and refused to live in the town. Especially when he overheard his Grandfather talking about the lane’s original name and its origin – Leper’s Way, the very place where legend said the area’s first inhabitants were burned alive to make way for the town as it stands today."	9.83	12.0	Michael Whitehouse	05/10/2020
Her Tongue Too Long	"In places where the very old traditions still hold, August is known as “the ghost month.” Hungry ghosts are said to roam the streets and hillsides, especially at night and especially when things are quiet. Some say that hungry ghosts are created when someone innocent dies a violent or unfair death. Others say the hungry ghosts are created by a person’s own misdeeds, their sins tainting their souls even in death.

One thing that is agreed upon is that the spirits always seek something that they craved in life. But they will not find it alone. Those who are still alive can do little to ease their suffering or help them along, but it is important to do all that we can. Offerings are one way to soothe a hungry ghost’s pain. For this reason, if you see a meal or small gift offered to the dead, it is in your best interest to leave it alone.

People often describe the hungry ghosts as having something wrong with their mouths, such that they cannot satisfy their swollen bellies. Sometimes a throat is as thin as a needle, or sometimes a mouth is sealed shut. The first ghost that Barton Edmund ever saw was not badly deformed. She didn’t have fetid breath or bulging eyes. The only clue as to how she died was that her tongue was far too long, dancing like a snake from her open mouth.

Mr. Edmund visited a town where the very old traditions still hold. It was a sweltering August day, and the town was bustling with preparations to honor the dead. As he walked he noticed that countless offerings had been crowded beneath a single hillside tree on the outskirts of the town. He asked a passerby why there should be so many gifts offered in a single place like that. “That’s where the nobleman’s daughter died,” the passerby told him. He did not seem inclined to say anything else.

On an evening walk that night, Mr. Edmund enjoyed the soft light of a gibbous moon and listened to the dry rattle of cicadas in the trees. At the hillside tree that was packed with gifts for the dead, a few candles burned. They produced a dim light, and cast the tree in an eerie state of dusk that existed only around the offerings. The candles had burned for hours already, and their flames were now nearly drowned by molten wax. One of the candles puffed out as he approached the tree on the hill.

Among the offerings was a framed ink drawing of the nobleman’s daughter. Mr. Edmund stooped to examine it more closely. She had been lovely in life, he thought to himself as he looked at the image. The drawing was preserved admirably. Someone must have guarded it as a dear keepsake. The woman in the frame wore clothing from centuries ago.

It was then that Mr. Edmund felt he was not alone. A growl, followed by a rasping bark, sounded from very near behind him. As he heard it the last of the dying candles blew out in a rush of freezing air. The specter brought with her a chill that coursed over the hillside. He turned and recognized the nobleman’s daughter immediately. Her clothing, her eyes, and her gorgeously thick hair were exactly as the ink drawing had depicted them.

No one had told how him how the nobleman’s daughter had died. But in his terror, Mr. Edmund now understood. Tradition holds that the hungry ghosts of those who die by hanging are disfigured in a unique way. It was precisely how the nobleman’s daughter appeared to him that night.

Her tongue dangled from her open throat, trailing past a badly broken jaw and nearly reaching her chest. The tongue was inhumanly long and it heaved around as though trying to escape her mouth entirely. The lower half of the woman’s formerly lovely smile was fully unhinged. Her jawbone was disarticulated from the skull, now only connected to her face by sallow flesh.

The tongue – bright red despite the corpselike pallor of her skin – lolled about uselessly and produced no sound. Mr. Edmund drew an inch nearer to the wraith despite his fear. He had to confirm a dreadful detail that he thought he the moonlight illuminated. Yes, he could now see it. The nobleman’s daughter still wore the heavy, braided noose that ended her life. Cinched tightly around her throat, the rope frayed away past the hangman’s knot. The result was a heavy collar that she could not remove.

A second rasping bark alerted Mr. Edmund to the phantasmal beast standing between the spirit and himself. Straining tautly at a chain held by the nobleman’s daughter was a deformed and hellish creature. Moving much like a predatory dog, it seemed eager to rip him apart. He had not noticed its presence earlier, because the thing crouched in the shadows of the dead woman’s form. It only moved to confront him as he stepped forward toward the nobleman’s daughter.

The leashed monstrosity was large enough to be a wolf. But if it was a wolf, then its pelt had gone missing. Rather than fur, the creature was covered with irregular and heavily scarred flesh. In the low light, Barton judged that the hound must have been burned, or perhaps scalded, all over its body. Its skin was a patchwork of necrotic gray and shiny-smooth pink. The miserable animal only looked healthy in the places where stretch marks had revealed new flesh from beneath the surface.

The ghost of the nobleman’s daughter let a few links of the chain slip through her clenched fist, allowing her dog-like thing to approach Mr. Edmund more closely. The beast still d sought to attack, and as he fell backwards in terror, Mr. Edmund saw the yellow gleam of its bared teeth. Worse still, he noticed that it had no eyes or ears. Whatever had damaged the ghoul’s skin also left it with dark holes where those should have been. Scrambling down the hill away from the tree, Mr. Edmund thought the creature would be upon him at any moment. As he turned to look back toward the shrine of offerings, however, there was no hint of the woman’s presence. Her monstrous pet had disappeared as well.

He learned from the townspeople that the woman with the grotesque tongue and the braided rope necklet had taken her own life. It was the end of a tragic love story, they told him. Mr. Edmund pressed for more information, but he only learned that the nobleman’s daughter once loved the animal trapper’s son. The nobleman was a cruel man and hated the animal trapper because of all the noisy and foul-smelling dogs he kept. The nobleman forbade his daughter to be married to the son of a commoner, especially one he detested so. When the two lovers would not submit to his demands, the nobleman did something truly awful. No one Mr. Edmund asked could say precisely what had transpired, but everyone agreed that after his daughter saw what the nobleman had done, she hanged herself in grief.

He heard deep and rasping barks on the second night that he stayed in that haunted town. Looking out of his room’s window, he saw a tall silhouette by the hillside tree where the offerings had been piled. Barton retrieved binoculars from his bag and used them to observe the hill from afar. He felt his pulse turn to ice as the magnified image revealed the woman with the too-long tongue staring directly into Barton’s lit window.

Worse still, as his trembling hands fumbled to focus the binoculars, Mr. Edmund could see that her hellish dog was still hunched in the shadows at her feet. It also looked in the direction of Barton’s window. It stared at him with empty eye sockets and sniffed the air with nostrils that were barely more than snakelike slits in its face. A truly unnatural dog, its snout was truncated, barely pronounced. Except in the way that it moved about, the beast was unlike any species of canine that Mr. Edmund had ever seen.

He asked those who would answer about monstrous dogs in the village or about whether a ghostly and misshapen wolf had been sighted in the past. “Yes,” a few brave townsfolk told him, always lowering their voices to a whisper as they did so. “We’ve heard the barking and the baying of an unholy animal on many dark nights.”

A few had even seen the apparition Mr. Edmund described and confirmed that the nobleman’s daughter always led it about, just as he had seen it. No one could explain how she had obtained such a frightful pet in the afterlife or why the creature guarded her so jealously. Mr. Edmund was maddened by the mystery of it, and so he persisted in his questions. He was eventually told that the local innkeeper – the very man with whom he had been boarding – knew more than most about the old stories of the nobleman’s daughter.

“There’s no such thing as a demon hound,” the innkeeper told Mr. Edmund gruffly. “The only ghosts in this town are the nobleman’s daughter and the animal trapper’s son.”

“I never saw the animal trapper’s son,” Barton insisted. “The daughter is always alone. There is not another human soul in sight, except for those of us who witness her. The only thing that walks with her is that monstrous, blind dog.”

“There is no dog,” said the innkeeper firmly. “The nobleman crippled the trapper’s son, and forced him for months to walk on all fours. He told the boy that he was just another of his father’s filthy curs. He broke the boy’s mind with torture and didn’t relent until the poor lad truly believed that he was an animal. After the nobleman had taught him to snarl and gnaw at scraps on the floor, the animal trapper’s son was presented to the town. After that, the nobleman had the broken son boiled alive, and the daughter was forced to watch her love die like an animal. What you saw were the daughter and her lover. Despite torment and death, they are still hopelessly devoted to each other.”

In the morning, Mr. Barton Edmund left an offering by the tree on the hill and fled that place forever. August comes and goes, but countless ghosts remain."	9.4	15.0	David Feuling	05/07/2020
Toualetehydrophobia	"I had no idea there were so many debilitating phobias. There are those that are terrified of right angles, Mexican food, the letter R, the metric system, and even a miserable few that fear Wednesdays, becoming incapacitated every hump-day. There is even a phobia of elastic. Can you imagine being afraid of your underwear?
Irrational fears are life-altering, and it broke my heart when we found out about my son’s. We discovered his while Christmas shopping at the mall. My son had to go to the bathroom, so we started our quest. Why department store bathrooms are located in the place farthest from where you start looking for them is a mystery for another time, but we found it. My five-year-old made a mad dash for the closest stall, and I knew by his pace that we’d just made it. I stepped over to the sink but before I turned the water on my son screamed.
I pushed on the stall door, but it was locked. “Jacob, you okay?”
“Daddy!” There was terror in his voice.
I kicked the door. It didn’t budge. “What’s wrong?”
“It’s trying to eat me.”
“What’s trying to eat you?”
“The water. Daddy!”
Had to be a joke. Do five-year-olds make jokes like this? “Can you unlock the door?”
“I can’t reach. It won’t let me.”
“What won’t let you?”
“The water. Help!”
I put my shoulder into the door. It popped with a metallic ping, and water splashed the floor. My son, tears on both cheeks, stood to the side of the bowl, hands clasping the toilet paper dispenser. He waddled, pants around his ankles, into my arms. I held him close. Water-soaked through my shirt, transferring from his body to mine. At first, I’d thought he’d peed himself, but there was water all over the floor, the toilet, even the walls.
“Did you fall in?”
“No Daddy, it grabbed me.”
I pushed him from my embrace. “I don’t understand. What grabbed you?”
He wiped his nose, getting the tears under control. “The water. It wanted to eat me.”
I looked into the toilet. Other than it needing a good cleaning, nothing seemed out of sorts.
“Jacob, water doesn’t eat people.”
“I felt its teeth.” He turned, pointing at his butt. “Right here.”
I looked at his skin, blinking a few times, hoping I’d find nothing. But on his left cheek in a circular pattern, six-inch diameter were tiny red marks. An image from an animated 80’s film When the Wind Blows came to mind. A rat in a toilet feeding on feces attacked a character, and even though a cartoon, the image has haunted me.
Again, I examined the bowl, this time for rodent hair and found nothing. By the time I looked back at my son, the marks were fading.
“Do you still have to go?”
He shook his head quickly, eyes wide.
Whatever had happened, I decided he’d been through enough. I wasn’t going to let on that I knew he was lying.
“Sometimes after a man pees, he has to go again right away. Think that might happen?”
He nodded, so I carried him to the nearest urinal. He wasn’t tall enough for the important part of his anatomy to reach so he stood on my feet. Unsure of how this new peeing arrangement was to work he pondered for a few beats before letting things flow.
It was about this time that my wife, Gayle poked her head in. “What’s taking so long?”
“We’re fine,” I said over my shoulder. “Had a situation.”
“Is it going to take long?”
“A minute. Why don’t you head over to gift-wrapping and we’ll meet you.”
“Fine,” she said, disdain in her voice. “Oh, and I ate your cookie.”
“Goddammit. The only reason I come to this mall is to get a cookie.”
“That’s a penny for the swear jar, Dad.”
“Okay. Take care of it later.” I sighed. My marriage was shit. There are only two times in life a woman will eat a man’s cookie without his permission; one when they just start dating and she knows that he is more interested in getting into her cookies rather than eating one, and second when the woman doesn’t give a rat’s ass about the consequences because the marriage has gone to complete and utter shit.
I cleaned Jacob up, no small chore thanks to the save-the-planet hand drying machines. If environmentalists spent less time saving us from ourselves and more time cleaning up after kids, we’d still have paper towels in public restrooms.
While Jacob picked out wrapping paper for our presents, Gayle asked me what had happened. I recapped it as best I could, even offered my rodent explanation. Hearing myself tell the story, I realized how strange it sounded, ridiculous, even surreal, but my wife didn’t react as I’d expected. Normally she would have taken the opportunity to point out how inattentive I was as a father, or lambasted me for not watching the situation closer like any good parent.
But it didn’t come. She just held a pensive look.
“What’re you thinking?”
“Not sure. He really said that ‘the water tried to eat him’?”
I nodded. Without another word she turned away and joined Jacob.
It was a quiet ride home. We arranged the presents for friends and relatives under the tree, my wife heated dinner, we played a board game, and that was it. We didn’t talk about it for weeks. Not until we had too. It was a Wednesday when Gayle called me at my office. I work in internet security as a consultant and was in a meeting telling a medical company how they were hacked, and what I was going to do to ensure it wouldn’t happen as easily next time—and rest assured, there’s always a next time—when my assistant interrupted.
“It’s your wife. Jacob’s in the hospital.”
I excused myself and picked up the line in the waiting area. “Gayle?”
“Where the fuck’ve you been?”
“In a meeting. What happened?”
“Jacob collapsed at school in horrible pain.”
“Jesus.”
“The ER doctor says his kidneys are backed up, and his colon is impacted.”
“What! How?”
“David, he hasn’t gone to the bathroom in almost three weeks. Not since that day at the mall.”
“That’s ridiculous. How is that—”
“David, just get down here.” Gayle sobbed. “They’re gonna put a catheter in him.”
I left the office in a daze, and don’t remember driving to the hospital. I sincerely hope I didn’t hit anybody. The next thing I knew, I was at my boy’s side as he howled in pain. Ever watch your child being fitted with a catheter? I don’t recommend it. They flushed his kidneys and ran tests to check for long-term damage. Toxicity levels in his young body were alarmingly high but hadn’t become lethal.
“How could a child, a five-year-old, keep from going to the bathroom for weeks?” I said to the attending physician, Dr. Adams. But even as the words left my lips, I knew it was the wrong question. How the hell could we, his parents, not know he wasn’t going to the bathroom?
I could tell by the doctor’s hesitant response that he’d like to know that as well. Instead of asking the question, he said, “There’s no physical reason why Jacob can’t go to the bathroom. Everything’s in working order. Any lingering discomfort he may experience will dissipate in a few days with the antibiotics I’ve prescribed. But there is nothing physically wrong with your son.”
“Okay, so that leaves us where?”
“I can only conclude that your son’s problem is physiological. I recommend he see a child psychologist.”
“Jesus.” I ran fingers through my hair.
Adams retrieved a card from a pocket. “Here’s the number of a wonderful therapist. She’s helped lots of children.”
I didn’t take the card. I didn’t want to. I didn’t want Jacob to need me to take the card. I wanted things back the way they were. I was in a loveless marriage, stuck in a lackluster job, but a proud parent of a great kid. And that was all I needed. I could live with that. But not this. “My son’s not crazy.”
“Nobody is saying that,” Adams said. “But he needs help.”
“We’re his parents. We’ll help him.”
Adams closed his eyes for a few beats as if this wasn’t the first conversation he’d had with a father in denial. He returned the card to his pocket. “We’re admitting Jacob for overnight observations. Barring any unexpected test results, he can go home tomorrow.”
An hour later Jacob was moved upstairs to a room, where exhaustion set in and he fell fast asleep. Gayle and I watched him for almost an hour without saying anything. We just sat and watched him breathe. After it seemed we were both convinced that he’d continue breathing even if we looked away, I finally spoke. “How did we miss this?”
“Miss what?” Gayle said.
“How did we miss that he wasn’t going to the bathroom?”
“By we, you mean, me, right?”
“No, Gayle. I really want to know,” I said trying not to sound accusatory. “Did he give you a reason why he wasn’t using the bathroom?”
Gayle closed her eyes. “Said he was afraid.”
“Of the bathroom?”
“The toilet water,” Gayle said. “He thinks it wants to eat him.”
“The water. Crap, this goes back to what happened at the damn mall.”
“What happened that day, David?”
“I told you everything. Even my rodent theory.”
“He wasn’t bitten. I checked when we got home,” Gayle said. “The marks you described were gone or were never there.”
“He said he feared the water? The water, Gail?”
Gayle nodded and then must have seen something on my face as the wheels in my head began to take me back. “This has nothing to do with that,” she snapped.
“No, of course not,” I said more to avoid a fight rather than stop my thought process. “I just think it’s interesting, that he said water.”
When we started dating—and I use the word dating loosely, as it was more a string of uninspired hook-ups—I learned about Gayle’s gift. There was a group of us out one night, discussing useless talents. My roommate demonstrated his ability to turn his eyelids inside out without touching them and Gayle’s sorority girlfriend could clip her toenails into a shot-glass, which she unfortunately demonstrated. I did my impression of a tap-dancing mouse with the full musical score. But Gayle’s talent was the topper of the evening. We sat mesmerized as she twirled her index finger over a glass of water. Without coming in physical contact with the glass or the liquid inside, the water move. It spun, mimicking the motion of her finger, swirling around like in a toilet bowl. If she changed direction, the water too changed.
During our six-month relationship, before she got pregnant, I’d seen her do a few other things inadvertently. Once at the beach, I swear she took control of a wave that was about to hit her. At least a foot over her head, and only seconds from crashing into her, Gayle held up her hands defensively and the wave split down the middle dissipating to either side of her. A few weeks later a speeding car drove through a huge puddle sending a shower of dirty water our way. We both saw it coming but I was the only one who got soaked. There are other examples but what we realized was that this talent, or gift, call it what you will, was one she could only summon when slightly intoxicated. She had to be drinking in order for it to work, not stoned. We know because we tried them all. It had to be alcohol.
We were always inebriated when together, but when she got pregnant, she stopped drinking, and so did I. It’s amazing how sobering a pregnancy test could be. It took some doing because as we were to find out we were alcoholics, or at least heading down that road. Jacob changed our lives and we found sobriety. And with sobriety came a fresh look at one another, resulting in more than just the loss of her unique talent.
“I can’t believe you’re bringing that up,” Gayle said. “It’s been fucking years. How dare you.”
“Goddammit, Gayle, I’m not accusing you. Shit, I just want to know why this happened.”
“And I don’t? I’m his mother.”
“Why’re you so fucking defensive?”
“I’m not – but everything is not my goddamn fault.”
“I…” I took a deep breath. “You’re right. Let’s just focus on Jacob. He needs us. Why don’t you go home, get some rest. I’ll stay with him tonight.”
Gayle nodded. “Think they’ll let you spend the night?”
“They’ll have a hard time stopping me.”
Gayle picked up her purse, kissed Jacob then moved over to me, hesitated, and gave me an obligatory hug. I squeezed her shoulders and wondered how long we could keep this up.
When the sounds of her footfall had faded down the hall, a groggy voice spoke from behind me.
“Hey, Daddy, I lost track…”
I turned to find Jacob’s eyes open. “Lost track?”
“I lost track, but I think you owe about ten dollars to the swear jar.”
I laughed. “Probably right, son. Take care of it when we get home.”
Jacob sat up. “Are you and mommy gonna get a divide?’
“A what?”
“This girl in my class, her parents got a divide. Now she gets two birthdays and two Christmases.”
His question was like a punch in the stomach. “You mean a divorce. And no, we’re not getting one.”
“But if you did, can I live with you?”
The weight of his words caused me to sit. I scooted closer to his bed. “Why wouldn’t you want to live with mommy?” I asked, not sure if there was an answer I wanted to hear.
“Mommies should always come when you call,” he said.
“What does that mean?”
His mouth opened to speak but paused, and I got the sense he was rethinking his answer. After a few beats, he said, “She doesn’t know anything about Star Wars and thinks Pokémon is dumb.”
“Well, now,” I said. “I understand. These are pretty serious issues. Maybe we should talk about them at the next family meeting.” I took a deep breath. “Right now, I’d like to talk about why we’re here, and not at home?”
“It’s because I hurt myself. I didn’t go to the bathroom.”
“That’s right. Mommy told me that—”
“It’s the water, Daddy. It wants to eat me,” Jacob’s voice rose, agitated.
“But, Jacob, you know that’s—”
“I’m not going near that water, ever again.”
Before I could respond there was a knock at the door. I turned as a nurse poked her head in. “Knock, knock,” she said, stepping inside. “Dr. Adams recommended we try this.”
“Is that a bedpan?” Outside of a movie I don’t think I’d ever seen a real one.
She nodded. “It’s kind of big, I know, but we don’t have a children’s ward at this hospital, so we don’t have his size.” She looked over at Jacob. “Do you want to give it a try?”
Jacob looked at me for guidance.
“Give it a go.”
Jacob sat on the thing in his bed. He seemed to like that there wasn’t any water in it, and although he didn’t go, it gave me an idea. I called Gayle and she said it was worth a try.
The next day upon arriving home we showed him what Gayle had bought. It was the largest toddler training toilet chair she could find. A kid’s version of a bedpan that sets on the floor in the bathroom while a child learns to take care of their business. On the packaging, it said for use with ages six months to two years, and it was odd seeing my five-year-old on it, but no weirder than a six-year-old in diapers, or a ten-year-old breastfeeding—all things I’ve seen. Gayle had even found a Pokémon one.
“Check it out, Buddy,” I said. “You can take a crap right on Pikachu’s face.”
Jacob laughed. “Swear jar, Dad.”
“Alright, but you have to clean it. You’re a big boy, and that means dumping out your business in the toilet. Your mom and I will help you the first few times, okay?”
Jacob nodded, less enthused. He looked over at the toilet as if it might grab him, then scooted the training chair as far away as possible.
And that was that. Over the next few days, Gail and I helped him with the dumping and cleaning and then he took over. We had our solution. It wasn’t perfect, like a square band-aid on a round wound, but in my mind, it was over. A temporarily fix, until he grew out of whatever the hell this was. But as I would soon learn, this wasn’t the kind of thing you grow out of.
Less than a month had passed, and I had all but forgotten about Jacob’s irrational behavior when Gayle met me at the front door one evening. In our five-year marriage not once had Gayle ever met me at the door. “Come with me to the backyard,” she said.
“Hello to you too,” I said.
I followed her around the side of the house. She pointed to spot by the fence. I could see flies. Hundreds. “Something die back there?”
Gayle shook her head. I could see she’d been crying. As I moved past her, the smell hit me. I gagged once, twice, then used my tie to cover my nose. Plastic beach shovels were scattered around, covered in what looked like mud. But it wasn’t mud. The stench of human waste overwhelmed me. I vomited, just missing my shoes.
I staggered back to Gayle, unable to deal with the realization that our son had been burying—
doing his five-year-old best—a month’s worth of excrement.
“Back at the hospital, Dr. Adams gave me a child psychologist’s number,” Gayle said. “He gave it to me because you wouldn’t take it.”
“Make an appointment,” I said.
“I already did. Tomorrow, ten a.m.,” Gayle said, walking away.
I gagged. “Good call,” and threw up again. This time my shoes weren’t as lucky.

Jacob saw the psychologist, Karen Mathews, three times a week for almost a month. I liked her. A bit young but really knew her stuff. After one initial meeting with all of us, she met with Jacob alone. After about session nine or ten, she asked to meet with Gayle and me while Jacob sat in the waiting room. There was a receptionist out there so Jacob wouldn’t be alone, but Jacob protested. There was a bathroom right next to the waiting area. When the toilet was flushed, the sound of the swirling water caused Jacob to tremble. He was now at the point where he couldn’t even be within ten feet of a toilet.
Karen allowed Jacob to stay if he promised not to listen. He sat in the corner with headphones and played a game on my phone as we began.
“I think he’s getting worse,” I started. “We keep his potty in the garage now. Hell, he brushes his teeth in the kitchen.”
“I know,” Karen said. “And you’re correct his situation is becoming paramount.”
Gail’s eyes were wet and red. “What’s wrong with him?”
“When we first met I mentioned a possible diagnosis, and one of the reasons I called you in here today is because I’d like to make it official. He is suffering from an acute case of Toualethydrophobia.”
“Jesus,” I said. “The fear of toilet water. How is that even a thing?”
Gayle began to sob silently.
“I don’t wish to spend our time focusing on the phobia itself,” Karen said. “What Jacob and I have been working on in our last few meetings is dealing with what triggered the phobia.”
“The incident at the department store this past Christmas.”
Karen shook her head. “It goes further back than that, and Jacob and I have been getting close, but every time we approach the event, he becomes blocked, very agitated, and shuts down.”
“Is there a way to get over this block?”
“Yes, and that’s the next thing I’d like to talk to you about. During our last few sessions, we’ve been working on EMDR therapy—Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. It’s a technique that will allow Jacob to approach the event and reframe how he feels about it. I hope we can alter his fear and turn it into a source of strength. Today I’d like to push past his block, deal with the event of origin, and start the process.”
I can’t say I understood everything she said, but it all sounded positive. Any improvement in my son would be welcome. “Are you asking our permission to do this?”
She smiled. “I just wanted you to be aware of where we’re at and what I’m hoping to accomplish today.”
“Is it all right if we watch?” Gayle asked.
“Of course,” Karen said. “Let’s get started.”
We sat in the corner of the room closest to the door while Karen prepared Jacob. There was a long serious of questions, asking Jacob about the colors and smells in the room. After fifteen minutes of this Jacob leaned back and put his hands behind his head. He took long steady breaths. I hadn’t seen him this relaxed in months. He smiled, even when the conversation turned to the trauma at the department store.
“And what did the water try to do?” Karen asked.
He responded casually. “Tried to eat me.”
“But it didn’t, did it?”
“Nope,” Jacob said.
“Why is that?”
Because water doesn’t eat people, I wanted to shout.
Jacob held up his hand as if he were thrusting a sword into the air. “Because I am strong. Way stronger than water.”
“That’s right, Jacob.” Karen pulled something out of her pocket. I couldn’t see what it was because of where I sat, but I could see that Jacob’s eye’s locked on it. I leaned a bit to catch a glimpse. Karen held a small toy. Kid’s call them fidget spinners. She used an index finger to give it a slight turn every few seconds, and with another finger, she started tapping on its center. So there was a turn, a tap, a turn, and a tap. It continued like this for several minutes. “Can you remember a time when you were going potty, but you didn’t feel strong? A time before the water tried to eat you at the department store.”
With his eyes locked on the toy, Jacob nodded.
“Can you tell me where that was?”
“At home.”
“Are you alone?”
“No, Mommy’s home. But she’s sick. I keep calling but she won’t come.”
“Did you need her?”
“Yes. Mommy help me. I’m falling.”
I looked over at Gayle. She was shaking. “What the fuck, Gayle?”
Without meeting my gaze, she got up and left. I followed, stopping only to shut the door to Karen’s office. I grabbed Gayle by the wrist.
She whirled around. “It’s not my fault.”
“What is Jacob talking about?”
She covered her face with her hands. “Oh, god, oh, god, please don’t let this be my fault.” I guided her to a couch. The receptionist’s eyes were on us, but I didn’t care.
“What happened?”
Gayle wiped her nose. “It was over a year ago, almost two. We told Jacob he couldn’t use the toddler practice seat anymore. He had to be a big boy and use the toilet without it. You remember?”
“Yes.”
“Well, one time, when…he…”
“Gayle, what the fuck happened?”
“He fell in, lost his grip or something.”
“Was he hurt?”
“No, but he was stuck. Couldn’t lift himself out.”
“Okay. So he called out and you came and got him.”
“I heard him calling. Over and over. Mommy help,” Gayle cried.
“You helped him, right?”
She looked at me, clearly reliving the scene. Her lips tightened.
“Why didn’t you help him?”
“Because I was drunk! I collapsed on the couch and just listened to him. I was sick of him. Sick of you.”
“Jesus, how long was he in there?”
She put her hands over her face. “Three hours. When I finally got him out I made him promise never to speak of what happened. Bury it. Just bury it.”
“Shit, Gayle.”
She dropped her hands and faced me, eyes angry. “You want to know why I was drinking?”
I stood up. “I don’t give a fuck.”
She grabbed my hand. “I unpacked your suitcase from your Boston trip. There was lipstick all over one of your shirt collars. Jesus, David, how cliché can you get?”
I leaned down, bringing my face close to hers. “You stupid bitch. Our client took us to a strip club. A stripper sat on me, kissed my neck, tried to sell me a lap dance. I left and took a cab back to the hotel.”
“You didn’t…” She slid off the couch and fell to the ground. “I’m sorry, David.”
I pulled my hand away. “Go home,” I said, then walked back into Karen’s office. I shut the door quickly. I didn’t want Jacob to hear his mother cry.
“Calm down, Jacob,” Karen said. She was on her knees in front of Jacob’s chair.
Jacob kicked wildly with both feet. “I can’t get out. I can’t.”
“That’s not where you are right now. Tell me what colors are in my office.”
“Mommy, where are you?!”
I walked over to Karen’s side. She held a hand out indicating not to interfere.
“Jacob, I need you to listen to me.” Karen put her hands on his shoulders.
“Mommy should come when I call.”
A crash came from the waiting room. It sounded like furniture being flipped over. It was punctuated by a bloodcurdling scream. Gayle’s screamed. I assumed Gayle was throwing a tantrum, but then there was another scream. Distinctly not Gayle’s. The receptionist. I moved toward the office door and looked back at Jacob.
“Help me, Mommy!”
Gayle screamed again, and like an echo, so did the receptionist.
I hurried into the waiting room, and my left foot instantly slipped on the wet floor. I kept myself from falling by grabbing a coffee table that had been upended. I stepped on drenched magazines. The receptionist was on the floor, clothes, and hair wet, one shoe gone. But Gayle was nowhere to be found.
“Where’s my wife?”
The woman didn’t say anything, just pointed toward the short hall heading to the bathroom. I jumped over the table and turned the corner just as Gayle screamed. I saw a pair of hands holding onto the doorframe inches from the ground. She pulled her head up into the hall and caught my gaze. “Help me, David!”
I dove, grabbed her hands and held tight. We were both pulled into the bathroom sliding on the wet floor. My head slammed into the sink and I lost my grip. I laid back and looked up in horror.
A funnel of water encased my wife’s legs. As it swirled around, sharp ripples gouged into her thighs. Blood streaked the water, winding around, red stripes on a candy cane. The funnel lifted her up, then slammed her against the stall door. Gayle reached for me, eyes pleading. But all I did, all I could do, was watch as the funnel swallowed her hips, then her torso. The twisting water pulled her into the stall, and that’s when I noticed where the tornado of liquid came from. The toilet.
The funnel began to sink into the bowl, getting smaller and smaller. The water made almost no sound, which seemed to amplify the snapping and crunching of Gayle’s bones. As it pulled my wife in, she said the last thing she would ever say to me. “David, it hurts.”
The lid came down with a slam. Water dripped down each side of the bowl, clean and clear. When I was finally able to take a breath, I felt something in my hand. I unclenched a fist and found Gayle’s wedding ring resting in the center of my palm. It must have come off when I had ahold of her hands.
Dizzy, I crawled over to the toilet, lifted the seat. The water was still, quiet. No sign of Gayle. No blood, hair, bone, nothing. Not even her scent. She was gone. I looked at the ring in my hand and tried to remember when we bought it. Where we bought it. Anything. I couldn’t. I let it drop into the bowl. Watched it sink. Then flushed.
*  *  *
Jacob and I are Canadian now. It’s not so bad. Bit cold. Nice health care. We made the sudden move up north when I began to realize the police were not on board with the “toilet ate my wife” story. I don’t blame them. I did think that the receptionist’s corroboration would help, and it did until parts of Gayle began showing up in different sewage treatment plants across the greater plains area. To put it mildly, it horrified the public, and police were pressured to find a suspect. Since there was no one but me, up to the Great White North we went. Not a difficult job for an internet security expert. In fact, the only hard part was convincing Jacob that our new last name couldn’t be Skywalker.
We’ve been up here a year and Jacob, who now goes by Luke, shows no signs of his toualetehydrophobia. Like my wife, it’s gone. I’ve given it a fair amount of thought and I’m still not sure if Gayle’s gift was the cause of Jacob’s phobia. Did she manifest something that terrorized him? I don’t know. But when it comes to Gayle’s death, I had a theory, and it was comforting for a while. I liked to think her guilt over what she may have done to Jacob took physical form through her gift and sentenced herself to her own form of punishment. I used to believe in some way it was kind of redeeming. She wasn’t a great mom, but at least she knew it and felt bad about it. Anyway, I don’t think that anymore.
On Jacob’s birthday, we went out for steaks. Like men. As we waited for the food to arrive, I thought I should check in with him about his mom. He hadn’t talked about her, and honestly at the time with all the covert relocating I was glad. I had my hands full. But we were settled now. It was time.
“Hey, Jacob.”
“Luke.”
“Right, Luke. Ever think about Mom?”
“No,” he said, putting a finger on the rim of his water glass.
“Well, do you miss her?”
“No.” He started moving his finger in a slow circle over his glass.
“Okay. Why not?”
He looked at me, eyes narrow. “Mommies should come when you call.”
A chill moved through me as I stared at his glass. The liquid moved.
I opened my mouth to ask him a question, one I did not want to ask for fear he might answer. Did you hurt your mom? But in the end, I didn’t need to. The answer was in his eyes, and in the liquid in the glass, now swirling like water in a toilet bowl."	9.58	12.0	Kevin David Anderson	05/05/2020
Mr. M. Wos	"I remember the first time I woke up. I didn’t know where I was or who I was. There were no memories of where I came from or what was happening to me. But there were bright white lights and maybe a dozen men in lab coats wandering all around me. I remember seeing machines with wires I could feel attached to my head. From my vantage point, I could see that I was in a big white sterile room with high-tech equipment mounted on the walls. There were monitors with stats and diagrams that at the time made no sense to me. Somewhere in the background, someone was spouting off diagnostics and somewhere in his long worded speech of technological jargon he said it. MWOS. Somehow it just clicked and I knew this was my name. I am Mr. M. Wos, I thought to myself. My attempts to speak only resulted in a few of the monitors showing heightened activity. The men in lab coats took notice and only wrote down some notes while looking at me more carefully. I tried to move my limbs, but I couldn’t feel them.
Taking a more careful look at my surroundings, I spotted them. My arms, legs, and torso were all separated from me, hooked up on different tables and mounts with wires and machines running through them like some sort of science experiment. Panic and fear shot through me like electricity and the multitude of colorful monitors started to spike and register my distress. If the data on all those computers could have been translated everyone in the room would have understood that I was screaming for them to put me back together! An alarm started wailing and the men started scrambling to their work stations trying to figure out what was wrong, yet despite their big brains and lab coats they somehow failed to understand that all of this was wrong!
They each started speaking at the same time, spouting off what they thought went wrong and listing the issues they thought they found. I had no voice, so I couldn’t tell them that when they started pushing buttons and pulling levers the electrical signals they sent jolting into my brain, my central core, hurt. I realized that they were poking around in my head looking for answers when all they had to do was literally look around them! I was alive and I was in pain! I wanted to thrash, struggle, run away, or fight, but all I could do was look on and listen as they continued to probe and torture me with their machines. Finally, after several agonizing minutes of alarms and blinking lights, a door burst open and a man in a suit and tie marched in with an air of authority and confidence. One of the men in lab coats immediately stood up to greet him.
“Dr. Stein! We’re sorry you had to come, I-I-I promise we’re looking into the complications. We think–”
“Shut up, Clerval!” the man in the suit and tie interrupted. “Hit the kill switch and cut the power! MWOS isn’t ready yet. I’ll be overseeing this project directly from this point on!”
And just like that, the man called Clerval quickstepped over to my head. He picked up a strange key-like tool and inserted it into the back of my neck. A sharp jolt of pain overshadowed the other forms of torture and the world faded back to black. I slept, but somehow in the background, I could still feel jolts of electricity as well as additional wires and machines being connected and disconnected from my body. I could hear some of what was happening to me when at times some part of my consciousness was alert. It was a level of hell that existed between the worlds of conscious and unconscious nightmares. Some words sunk in and some names I committed to memory. I came to understand that I was part of some kind of military project, some science experiment funded by some major investors named Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her partner Percy Bysshe Shelley. High ranking members of a top-secret department of defense project. The project I was unwillingly apart of.
The leading doctor in charge was the man in the suit and tie, all I knew about him was that his name was Dr. Stein. He was the one responsible for the experiments and torture being conducted. I don’t know how long I slept for, but nightmares of being eviscerated, bisected, electrocuted, and reanimated plagued my mind. Machines whirred in the background and computers probed through wires and connectors that were implanted in my brain. Pain was a constant whenever parts of my mind were awake to feel it. Some of my very thoughts were rearranged, erased, reprogramed, or fabricated. But I held on to the names of my torturers. I held on to the memories of the suffering they put me through. I no longer cared who I was or where I came from. Any concerns over the mystery of how I became entangled in this torturous series of confusing science experiments were overshadowed by my ever-growing rage and desire to punish these monsters.
The next time I was finally awake again and my eyes were open I saw that I was now upright with the aid of some kind of metal stand. This time I could feel my body, my arms, legs and torso were firmly reattached. Painful signals still coursed through my head, but at this point I hardly noticed. The joy of having my body back in one piece made me want to cry, yet I couldn’t. The men in their lab coats were busy typing away on their computers while others inspected my body with strange devices and scanners. I made note that I was visibly taller than everyone in the room, and thus it was surmisable that I was stronger as well, yet I still couldn’t move. Dr. Stein stood off in the distance with a tablet and stylus in hand. He pressed a few things on his tablet before looking up and speaking.
“Begin automated control test one!” he boomed at the scientists in the room.
“Commencing AC test one, right arm,” responded Dr. Clerval who was sitting at a computer terminal.
Instantly I felt a jolt of electricity surge through my head and into my right arm. It was excruciating yet I couldn’t scream out or struggle against it. I watched helplessly as my arm rose from my side straight in front of me. Another surge of electricity bent my arm at the elbow and brought my hand towards my face. A sharp tingle then stabs of pain like a thousand needles being pushed into my fingers made my hand ball up into a fist then relax before another spike of pain made me wiggle my individual digits. They repeated this process for several minutes, making my arm and hand move and bend at strange and unnatural angles. All the while I fought to stop the torture, unable to resist the electrical orders to move to their will. Then they did the same with the rest of my libs. I was their puppet dancing to the pull of their electric wires attached to my body.
Several hours of torture followed by way of forcing me to conduct mundane tasks such as picking up a glass without shattering it under my immense strength, or picking up several tons worth of weights, and even smashing through brick and armored surfaces. Although I was unable to will my body to stop, in some instances I did resist for a moment before the pain of the electrical shocks forced me to submit. My mind became a factory where the production line took in the pain and humiliation from performing under the torture of my puppeteers and reassembled it as hate, rage, and the desire for revenge, all properly packed, labeled, and stored in bulk. I was hooked back up to the metal frame towards the end of the day and only after everyone went home did Dr. Stein approach me. He was within my reach, all I had to do was snatch him up by his throat and snap his neck! I willed my arm to move, I screamed in my head for it to obey me and kill this evil bastard! But I remained still, a prisoner inside my own body.
Stein took another step closer and looked directly at my face before speaking.
“You’re going to make me rich. Next up is the live field test and then mass production.”
Every fiber of my being wanted to move, wanted to lunge forward and rip this man to shreds! I once again willed my body to move, focused all of my will on raising my arm up and clutching this man’s throat. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the same key-like tool used to put me back to sleep. It was now or never and I needed to kill this man. One final push to move my arm and I felt it. My efforts paid off and my arm twitched. It wasn’t the movement I wanted, but it was a start. Stein hesitated for a moment before reaching for the back of my head and looked down at my now still arm.
“Hmm… Looks like we still have some bugs to work out, but nothing I can’t fix.”
Before I could try again he reached behind my head and the familiar sharp pain coursed into me and the world went dark again. For the next several weeks I’d be woken up either to perform more agonizing tests or to have more wires inserted into my brain to further implement more control over me. I again struggled to hold on to my hate and my memories as they ran surges of power through me day in and day out. I did everything from sweep floors to use weapons. My body was put through intense heat. I learned that I was immune to the extreme effects of the elements, could survive intense pressure, and even take rapid fire from heavy weapons with little to no damage. None of these things hurt me, though. All the pain I experienced was from being forced to move at the will of the men in lab coats, and all at the orders of Dr. Stein.
After what seemed like an eternity, the big day finally came, the big field test the good doctor had promised. I once again woke up in my steel stand. This time there was something very different, I felt no pain, no electrical surge coursed through my body. All I felt was a paralyzing stiffness holding me in place. Before me were several men in military uniforms in a wide-open desert field. U.S. Air Force was etched on several military vehicles off in the distance. Dr. Stein was nowhere to be seen, but a moment later his voice echoed inside my head as if he was speaking directly to me.
“Captain Walton, U.S. Air Force. This is Doctor Victor Stein. I’ll be guiding you through the field test today. You are piloting the MWOS Mark 0 prototype. I’m sure you’re well versed in the instructions we provided you, but if you have any questions before we begin please feel free to ask.”
Before I had any time to wonder who the hell Captain Walton was I heard him speak through me- no- more accurately from inside me.
“Copy that, doctor. I’ve gone through the simulations and I’m ready to start at your command.”
I was confused, what was happening? The uniformed men all stepped away towards the safety of a bunker and after a quick back and forth between Walton and Stein the field test began. I felt the stiffness of my invisible restraints fall away and for the first time I stood unbound, yet I still could not move by my own accord. A force within me, however, took a step forward. As it moved I felt my body move with it. Stein spoke again into my head and gave instructions to Walton. As I said, I no longer felt the forced pains of electrical impulses that once governed my movements, yet I was still someone’s marionette. The warehouses of rage opened up in my mind and it was time to deliver. My anger was now my fuel, providing me the strength to resist the commands of my new puppeteer. He raised my arm, and for the first time, I noticed it was now adorned with a retractable blade, one I had become familiar with during many of the agonizing tests.
On my other arm was a heavy and fully-loaded ballistic weapon, one that I had also learned how to use while under the guidance of my torturous electrical strings. The fools had armed me, gifted me the tools to achieve my revenge. These new developments coupled with my rage granted me my first victory. Walton took a step forward, but I didn’t. Mid step I halted and the dirt ground quickly came up to meet me. I heard Walton exclaim in surprise when I hit the ground. He attempted to stand up and I allowed it. I heard Stein flood my head with a series of questions and concerns. However, Walton took the blame for the fall and asked to proceed with the field test. He took several steps forward, and through his motions, I learned how to walk. He faced away from the bunker, and under Stein’s instructions, he prepared to test the ballistic weapon. I felt it activate and become armed and immediately I willed it to shut off. He attempted to rearm it, but that control now belonged to me. He attempted to speak back to Dr. Stein, but I cut off his connection. I turned my head a complete 180 degrees to look at the bunker behind me and felt a loud snap from within me. Captain Walton’s influence faded instantly and for the first time, my body was my own.
I felt a thought enter my mind- no, a command, to shut down, to go back to sleep. I ignored it. I continued turning my head an additional 180 degrees to face forward again and then performed a well-practiced abut face to point my now armed weapon at the bunker. Hoping to kill Stein along with every man hiding behind those walls I unleashed a well-aimed attack. Over the sound of my fully-automatic weapon, my advanced and sensitive ears could hear the screams of every man inside. Once the weapon was empty, with the will of my thoughts, it detached from my arm and I stood still to listen to every heartbeat inside that bunker fade into silence. After a few moments, a familiar and infuriating voice echoed in my head again. I was enraged to learn that Stein wasn’t in the building after all.
“This is Dr. Stein…” Gone was the air of authority and confidence from his voice, replaced now with fear and confusion. “Who is piloting MWOS?”
For the first time, I spoke with my own voice. “My name is Mr. M. Wos.”
He seemed to ignore this and instead opted to try and regain control. I felt his commands like a tickle in the back of my mind. He wanted me to shut down. He activated a failsafe. He even tried to enter the self-destruct codes. I ignored them all. He tried everything, even issued a few threats in a final frustrated attempt to regain control. It took me a few minutes, but I figured out I could track him through that connection. He must have learned what I was doing because he promptly cut the connection before I knew exactly where he was. It’s been a few weeks since that incident and I’ve been learning a few new tricks since then. Did you know that I can connect to the internet? I found a few interesting news articles:
“Artificial Intelligence Controls New Weapon”
“Military Wartime Operation System Now Sentient”
“Military’s Weaponized Armor Lives!”
“War Machine Slays Airmen, Then Escapes”
“MWOS Rampages Seeking Creator”
Doctor Victor Franklin Stein, no longer am I your marionette to play with and torture. I know you’ve gone into hiding. My connection to the World Wide Web will facilitate my ability to hunt you down. It’s only a matter of time before I locate you. During the past few weeks, I’ve come up with a fitting punishment for you. When I find you, your death won’t be quick as it was with Godwin and Shelley. I’m going to expel U.S. Air Force Captain Walton’s rotting corpse from my hard, metallic body and force you to take his place and cut down anyone that gets in my way.
I promise that you’re going to feel every sliver of pain you afflicted on me, and thanks to the life support system you built into me, I can extend that pain for you for as long as possible. I will wander this earth with you as my passenger until I feel your heart stop. Then I’ll keep going until your corpse disintegrates into mulch. So commit my name to memory, doctor.
I am Mr. M. Wos."	9.81	27.0	Jay Corvus	05/04/2020
There Were Two Moons in the Sky Last Night	"Have you ever looked up at the moon at night and dreamed of a better life? Maybe wished for love or simply looked for inspiration? It’s amazing, isn’t it, such a magnificent celestial body just hanging in the sky, one we’ve lived with since the beginning of time. Your parents, grandparents and forefathers have all been mesmerized by the beauty in the sky; they’ve all seen the same moon.
I used to love that sight, but now I feel terrified each night as it rises, fearing that I might once again see two moons.
* * * * * *
It was a strange set of events that finally landed me in the middle of nowhere, also known as Svalbard; a small Norwegian island as close to the North Pole as people are willing to live. Inhabited by fewer than three thousand people, all with an astonishing command of the English language.
Without Luke, I probably wouldn’t have ended up anywhere nearly as exotic, but as my best friend, he had pulled me into the field of biology after I had spent years not knowing what to do with my life.
Together with him and Samantha, another bright student with a passion for both nature and all fields of science, ranging from biology to astrology, we ventured into the unknown with a foolish dream of acquiring the ever-so-elusive doctorate degree.
Our new home would be Longyeartown, a perfect name for a city in the middle of the arctic, where everything moved at a snail’s pace.
Polar bears, northern lights, endless winter nights and everlasting summer days. Had I not known better, I wouldn’t have believed I was still on Earth.
We first arrived at the beginning of August. Greeted by our guide and teacher, Walter; A man who looked more like a bear than a human being. A massive, bearded Viking, probably born in the snow, holding a battle-axe. He would ensure our safety and assist us in studying the wild life.
It was a beautiful sight, I have to admit. Despite being at the end of summer, the weather was harsh, barely rising above forty degrees even though the sun was up for the entirety of the day. Nevertheless, there was something magical about the landscape.
The midnight sun shined bright, a perfect yellow sky to keep us company the entire night, as we celebrated the start of our new adventures.
During the first couple of weeks, Walter was very incessant about us taking a proper safety course while living there. Though rifles were prohibited in any settlement on the island, they were strongly recommended during research, due to the dangers of polar bears being curious. As cuddly as they might seem, when you’ve observed them tear apart prey, completely covering their white fur in the crimson stains of blood, you’ll understand not to mess with them.
September quickly rolled around and the midnight sun had long since disappeared, days grew shorter and nights longer, but we enjoyed every moment together. It had become apparent that Luke had a crush on Samantha, and though I would never reveal that secret, it seemed odd to me that she hadn’t noticed.
Luke had always been quite shy, even though he had an overabundance of attention from the other sex, being a sportsman and ridiculously attractive and all, but some darkness from his past had kept him from growing a proper confident facade.
* * * * * *
At the half-year mark of our stay, we’d already gathered a substantial amount of data for our research. Without going into too much detail, it included observing the Walrus haul-out behavior, meaning when they leave the water and what they do on land.
Not too exciting for most people I’m sure, but we truly loved our work.
It was the end of January, which meant the sun never showed itself, even during the day. Constant darkness surrounded us during that period, but at least we’d have times of bright moonlight and nautical twilight, which seemed like any late sunset. It kept us from getting the winter blues.
By then I had confronted Luke about his feelings for Samantha. They were both my closest friends, and though I wouldn’t mind them getting together, I wanted to make sure nothing dramatic and childish would happen. Of course, he denied it, shy as he was, but Samantha had started hinting at similar feelings for him.
Had just one of them spoken up rather than being stubborn kids, they could have been happy together, but what else could I do other than to poke at their emotions until one of them burst.
During the night we’d driven one of the cars down to the beach. Though I had always considered a beach as a warm bunch of sand by the seaside, it was equally beautiful. Walter often accompanied us on our little drunken trips, having become more of a friend than a teacher, but he insisted that even though we had driven down there, we would walk back to our houses rather than drunk driving. He said this even though the population was so sparse that hitting anything was almost impossible.
Back at the house we played cards and drank home-brewed Norwegian vodka, illegal, disgusting, but cheap, and it got to job done.
Walter was probably the biggest man I’d ever laid my eyes upon, but he honestly had the bladder of a small child. There’s something about subzero temperatures that really makes you need to take a piss every thirty minutes, but since the bathroom was occupied, he ventured outside to relieve himself.
Moments later we heard him gasp.
“Hey, come and have a look at this!” Walter called from outside.
Not wanting to leave the warm comfort of my chair, I took a large sip of my drink and yelled back at him, “It’s cold as all hell! I’m not coming outside to look at your dick!” The others chuckled, more from the alcohol than my stupid statement.
“No, seriously, there’s something wrong with the sky,” Walter said.
“Alright, coming,” I said as I pushed myself up from the chair, my legs barely wanting to move after an entire day of exploration.
The four of us went outside to find Walter frozen in his place, just staring up at the sky. I glanced up and immediately shared his confusion.
There were two moons.
We all gasped synchronously as we tried to make sense of the bizarre phenomenon in the night sky.
“What the hell?” Luke said. ”It’s got to be an optical illusion, right?”
For a second I let myself believe that was the explanation, but the second moon, though equal in size and shape, had a completely different surface. It was plainer, with less craters and a whiter tone than our own.
“No way, they’re too far away from each other, they don’t even look alike,” I said.
“So what’s your explanation then?” Luke asked.
Samantha, who had been an astronomy aficionado since she was old enough to pronounce ‘rocket’ had remained oddly silent since we got outside.
“The second moon is identical to our own,” she simply stated.
“What, it’s clearly not?” Luke asked, confused.
“No, it really is, it’s just that we’re looking at it from the back, it’s like our moon has been rotated almost 180 degrees. Just look at the edge.”
I tried to see what she meant, and sure enough, the edge of the second moon had landmarks I could recognize on our own.
“What, so the moon split in half or something?” I asked.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Walter interjected.
“That’s weird, but it’s kind of cool, isn’t it?” Lucas.
“Cool, or terrifying. Fuck if I know,” Samantha said.
We decided that we could get a better view from halfway up Plateau Mountain next to Longyeartown. So we rushed, Walter bringing his camera, in an attempt to capture any kind of proof that we hadn’t all just collectively gotten poisoned from the alcohol and were hallucinating.
As we climbed up we started hearing a strange noise in the distance, just vaguely at first, like an electrical humming from a generator.
“This will do, won’t it?” I asked as we were about one third up the mountain. I wasn’t in the best shape of my life, and climbing up a 1300 feet mountain wouldn’t be my choice for a good time.
We looked back at the sky. Sure enough, the two moons lingered in the sky, both full and ever so bright. The four of us just stared in silence for what felt like an eternity, the humming turning to a buzz as we waited.
“Do you guys hear that?” Walter finally said.
The buzzing sound got louder, and started to localize itself to the village, we glanced down at our neighborhood and realized we realized all the houses had moved around, jumbled up and unrecognizable. Colors were changed, streets turned directly into buildings and shops had simply vanished.
We rushed back down the mountain, but stopped before entering the village. New houses had appeared, extending the settlement to twice its normal size, even Walter who had lived there most of his life couldn’t find his way anymore. “My house was supposed to be right there,” he said as he pointed to an empty piece of land a couple of hundred feet down the hill.
A light appeared where Walter was pointing, indefinable at first, but it quickly took shape as Walter’s home. It looked like static on an old television, but it was clearly a house. As it took shape we could hear a faint screaming coming from inside.
“Shit, shit, shit, my wife is in there!” Walter said as he started running towards the house, we took chase after him.
The closer we got to the obscured version of his home the more uneasy I felt about entering it. A pit formed in my stomach and following my instincts I attempted to stop Walter. Being twice my size, he simply pushed me away and kept running.
“Walter, wait!” I screamed at him just as he passed the barrier from us to the entrance to the house.
He only got halfway in before the house vanished before our eyes, taking just part of Walter with it. He had been split down the middle, and the little part that remained of him simply fell to the ground in a pile of blood and viscera.
“Oh, my God! No, no, no!” Samantha cried as she stared at Walter’s mangled corpse, his face and chest had been stripped away alongside his arm, everything that had made it past the barrier simply cut away.
We couldn’t even process what had just happened before we were all blinded by a flash of light. A completely new village appeared in front of us, the old one mostly stripped away from reality.
Just within reach of the new village, we could hear the panicked yells from the people within. Screams of fear and agony vibrated through the air. We realized that the new village had appeared inside parts of our own, houses merging in ways not possible, people stuck inside walls or cut in half by the vanishing buildings.
We saw one man cut in two at the waist crawling for help, his entrails pouring out as he desperately tried to keep moving, not even realizing that half his body had been taken away from him.
People came running away from the village, some missing legs, one woman seemingly fused with a different version of her, joined at the head like a pair of conjoined twins.
As the people neared us we could see the true devastation of what had happened inside the village. Houses disappeared and reappeared in new locations, anyone unlucky enough to be in the same place was shred to pieces.
One older woman was looking back at the village as she ran away, and ended up colliding with me head-on. I quickly bent down to help her up, and she rambled on about something, only I couldn’t understand what language she was speaking. It wasn’t English or Norwegian, nor Russian. In fact, it didn’t resemble anything I’d ever heard before.
Some man was waving furiously at us as he passed, and even though we couldn’t understand the language, we got the point.
“We’ve got to get out of here!” I said.
“B-b-b, but Walter, we can’t leave him here.”
“He’s dead, Samantha! Come on!”
Luke and I grabbed her and pulled her with us, we were all in shock with just enough basic survival instincts to flee.
We ran away as fast as our legs could carry us, but I couldn’t resist the urge to look back upon the nightmare we were trying to escape. One moment our village was there, and in the next a completely new configuration of houses and streets, they appeared together, merged into each other, and collapsed in a mesh of wood and concrete.
The people fleeing the village seemed to have an idea where to go, so we attempted to follow them, but in another flash, they were simply deleted from existence.
“Oh, my God,” I said.
“Where did they go?” Samantha asked.
I couldn’t answer that, none of us could, things had downhill so fast we hadn’t had half a second to wrap our minds around it.
We stopped. I was starting to feel just how out of shape I was. There were no more screams coming from the village, and it seemed to have mostly settled down into an indefinable mixture of houses and corpses.
“Do you think it’s over?” Luke asked.
“I don’t know, there are still two moons in the sky,” I said.
“We should call someone!”
“I left my phone back at the house.”
“Me, too.”
Despite the chaos, everything felt pretty calm after the people had vanished. We had reached higher ground, giving us a decent view of the area. The village was still morphing at its own volition, but I couldn’t see any signs of life, I guess whoever failed escape must have been dead by then.
“What are we gonna do?” Samantha asked
“The car we parked at the beach,” Luke said.
“So what, we’re on an island. Where are we going to drive?”
“The walkie will be there, and it’ll be enough to keep us warm if it doesn’t disappear like everything else.”
“So basically we just avoid the inevitable?”
“Do you have a better idea?”
While the two of them argued about what to do next I kept watching the horizon. The way it illuminated so much brighter in the moonlight than usual was remarkably beautiful, establishing a certain calmness in the horrific landscape.
Then something broke the purity of the horizon, a creature walking across it, only showing as a silhouette; First one, then two, and before I could even alert the others there were at least three dozen large beings walking in the distance.
“Uh, guys,” I said.
They kept arguing.
“Guys, look!”
The two of them shut up long enough to notice I was pointing at the creatures.
“Shit, are those polar bears?” Luke asked.
“I don’t think so. They’re way too big,” I responded.
“Now we really have to head for the car. The rifles are still there.”
Without any better idea, we started heading for the beach. Midnight had come and gone and the temperature had dropped even further below zero, considering the weather, the clothes we had were far from sufficient.
It was a short trek through the snow, but sure enough, the car was still there, faithfully awaiting our arrival.
“Thank fuck for that!” Samantha exclaimed in joy.
We all rushed over. Samantha excitedly wrapped herself in a thicker jacket she had left in the car.
“Here, grab a rifle,” Luke said as he handed me one of the two.
“I’m not the best shot,” I said nervously.
“Doesn’t matter, it’s just supposed to be loud enough to scare the bears a bit.”
“I don’t think they’re normal bears, man.”
“Well, whatever the fuck they are, they’re not gonna like guns.”
He said it with a strange hint of confidence that didn’t normally come from him.
Samantha grabbed the walkie from the glove compartment.
“Hello?” she said.
“You gotta end it with over, Sam,” I said jokingly, trying to diffuse the tense atmosphere.
“Fuck off.”
The radio responded with static.
“Hello, is there anyone there?”
Nothing.
“I’ll keep trying different channels. Where are we heading next?”
“Well, the car’s dead, so we’re walking, but the airport is only a couple of miles away, so I suggest we head there,” Luke said.
Without disagreeing we started going. I kept my eye on the horizon, seeing more silhouettes gathering, a few were venturing into the broken village, but they were still too far, and I couldn’t fathom what the hell they were.
“Guys, I need a break,” I said after about half an hour of walking. My leg had been aching since the woman collided with me, but the cold had numbed down the pain so far.
“It’s kind of beautiful, isn’t it?” Samantha said.
She stood on the side of the road staring at the sky. I had noticed it before, almost mesmerizing to see a new celestial body floating above in our sky, that had remained unchanged as far back in history as anyone could remember. We were the first to see the new moon, but if the world was experiencing the same freakish chaos as ourselves, then I feared we’d also be the last.
After a mile we could see the top of the air traffic control tower, no sooner before we noticed it, the whole structure collapsed to the ground, realizing an impossibly bright, green light as it did.
“What was th–”
Before we could react a loud roar fell over us, one of the creatures emerged from the darkness and stood tall in front of us. It had the exact shape of a polar bear, only larger without any skin covering its body. All we could see was muscle and vessels pulsating across its entire being, skinned from head to toe.
The face was the most horrific part of it. No eyes or ears, only a flesh filled, mangled piece of meat with teeth sticking through in all directions. Despite having no vision, it could somehow sense our whereabouts.
It looked directly at us for a second before charging, we started running. The creature was fast, but the vibrant green light seemed to bother it enough to allow us a head start, though it didn’t take long before it braved the brightness in took chase after us.
Once we gained enough of a distance, I turned to fire at it. To my surprise the shot hit it square in its face, but it barely fazed it. Luke turned to do the same, but as he fired his foot caught onto something and he fell to the ground.
“Shit!” he yelled.
We ran over to pull him off the ground, and he fired a second shot at the creature, he hit it in the leg, causing it to stumble for a moment. It was just enough for us to get Luke back on his feet, but he was slower from the fall.
“I think I messed up my ankle,” Luke said.
I took his arm over my shoulder. The creature was gaining speed again.
“I’m not going to make it like this. Just go!” he said.
“You’re not going to die because of a twisted ankle, you moron,” Samantha insisted as she held his other arm.
For each second the creature got closer to us, even without Luke hanging onto us we wouldn’t be fast enough to get away.
The creature reached us and knocked us all simultaneously to the ground. It reached out its deformed paw and hit Luke’s shoulder. He let out a horrified scream as the claws tore through his skin. Blood immediately started dripping from the wound.
All of a sudden the creature stopped, and a large howl could be heard from the distance, it was distorted and rough, unlike anything I’d ever heard. I could only describe it as vaguely organic, as if some massive animal was screaming out in intense agony.
Without hesitating, the creature started running in the direction of the howl, once again leaving us alone in the darkness.
I collapsed on the ground under Luke’s weight. He had always been far larger than me, a typical gym rat always bugging me to join him.
“Damn you’re heavy, Luke.”
“What was that thing?” he asked out of breath.
None of us knew, how could we, everything had fallen apart, and if I was starting to believe we were in a different world altogether. The green light on the horizon still shined bright, acting as an excellent beacon taking us where we had to go.
Luke was quick to get back on his feet, he tried to act strong, but we could both tell he was in a great deal of pain.
After a long struggle, we finally reached what remained of the airport. It wasn’t an impressive sight, only one runway and a couple of planes next to the few centralized buildings. It was desolate, not another living soul seemed to have made it there.
Unlike the village the airport still looked familiar, though the tower had fallen to pieces, replaced by the blinding green light that had guided us, a strange beacon of hope in the destruction. It simply hung in the air expectantly, waiting for something to happen.
Luke collapsed to the ground as we set foot inside the main building.
“I don’t feel right,” was all he could say.
“It’s alright, Luke. We’re gonna be safe here.”
We dragged him over to one of the office buildings that were connected to the hangar. Luke was sweating bullets. Samantha put a hand to his forehead and checked his temperature.
“Luke, you’re burning up!”
“Yeah, I think something’s wrong,” he responded with slurred words.
“I’m going to check the building for any supplies. I’ll be right back,” I said.
“Sam, I have to tell you something,” I heard Luke say as I left.
I hoped he was confessing his feelings for her, and that they could have a nice moment of happiness to hold onto. Because I suspected things weren’t going to end well for us.
By the time I got back, I had only found a packed lunch, a half-empty bottle of water and a flashlight, but Luke was barely awake, and refused any of it.
Samantha sat next to Luke and held his hand as he fell unconscious. He looked pale, already skinnier than before, as if he hadn’t eaten in weeks, something seemed to be feeding off him from the inside.
“How’s his shoulder?” I asked.
“It completely healed, but…”
“But what?”
“Look at his skin.”
I shun the flashlight at Luke’s shoulder, there were strange lumps moving beneath his skin, pulsating. I covered up his shoulder, not wanting to think about what these things were. Whatever was happening, we were too ill-equipped to help him, our only hope would be to wait for morning and hopefully find a doctor.
“We should try to get some sleep. It will be easier to deal with everything during the day,” I said.
We huddled up closer around Luke; even inside, it was barely above zero. Exhausted, we quickly fell asleep.
I awoke to Samantha screaming. I shoot quickly to my feet and fumbled around for the flashlight. As I shined the light at her, I could see that she was embraced by dozens of thin, black tendrils all emerging from Luke’s left arm and shoulder.
Luke’s eyes had punctured, black liquid seeping out from the holes, and his chest had been torn open, revealing his lung, infested with thousands of tiny black worms crawling around inside. He was beyond dead, but to my horror, he was still moving. I pulled out my knife and swung at the tendrils around Samantha, they were elastic and it took all the force I had to cut through them, one by one, until Samantha was finally free.
Luke screamed in agony, only it wasn’t his voice. As the tendrils retracted back into his arm, new ones shot out immediately replacing the broken ones.
I grabbed Samantha’s arm and told her to run. She took Luke’s rifle off the ground as we ran past and shoved him to the ground. It only slowed him down for a second before he followed. The tendrils kept him off the ground and pulled his body with them.
We ran into a small storage room and shut the door behind us. Luke smashed into the door at full force, opening it just enough to let the tendrils slither inside. I cut them down as Samantha tried to hold the door shut.
“You have to shoot it!” I yelled at her.
“But, it’s Luke,” she stuttered back.
“No, it isn’t, not anymore.”
She looked at me with terror in her eyes, but she knew what we had to do.
“I’m going to open the door,” I said.
She nodded.
On the count of three, I pulled open the door, and Luke stumbled inside. His face had been split in half down the middle, allowing thousands of tiny, black maggots to pour out from the head.
“Shoot!” I yelled.
Samantha fired off a shot, and it hit him square in the neck. Mixed with the damage from the worms his head tore from his torso and fell to the ground. He stumbled, but remained standing. I slashed at him with my knife and cut him further apart, trying at least to keep him at bay.
“Sam, you gotta get out of here!”
She didn’t listen, but I couldn’t see what she was doing. I could hear her rummage through some cans and equipment.
“I’m not fucking leaving you!” she said as she emptied the content of whatever can she had found over Luke, some of it splashed over onto my face. I could smell the vapors, it was gasoline.
The creature slipped on a mix of its own worms and gas that had fallen onto the ground. I took the opportunity to get away. I dug a lighter out of my pocket and carefully lit it, hoping the drops of gasoline on me wouldn’t ignite.
I threw the lighter at Luke and he immediately engulfed in flames. The worms screeched as they burned to pieces, thousands of tiny burning monstrosities crawling around, lighting up every around them.
The fire spread so quickly, faster than I thought would be possible, and before we could even get out of the way we were surrounded on all sides. The only exit had already started to burn, and I knew then we were going to die with no hope of escaping.
We embraced each other during our final moments and just prayed it would be over quickly, that the smoke would suffocate us before the fire could reach us.
Coughing from the smoke I dared to take a peek at the flames, the whole hangar was starting to collapse, and within a minute of starting the flame, the roof fell on top of us.
Just before passing out I saw the bright green light looming over us, and at its center, I could see the image of a different world, one not destroyed and inhabited by horrific creatures.
Then everything turned dark…
* * * * * *
A voice called out to me, bringing me back from the depths of unconsciousness. The voice was unfamiliar, speaking in Norwegian. I couldn’t understand half of it, but I knew he was asking if I was okay.
I opened my eyes and was hit by the dim light of day, even during an arctic night the mornings are bright enough to tell the difference.
“Where’s Samantha?” was all I could say.
“Oh, you’re English. You mean the girl you were with? Yeah, she’s fine. What happened to you two?” The man bombarded me with questions, but remained silent, still too weak to think properly.
The man pointed to a stretcher carrying Samantha. They had put an oxygen mask on her, but she seemed mostly awake, with only minor bruises and some inhalation. The airport had been fully restored, not even a hint of destruction from the previous night, and no sign of a second moon remained.
We had to spend the next week at their local clinic, trying our best to answer their questions about how we got hurt, and how we managed to get inside the hangar in the middle of the night, and how we had both suffered pretty severe damage from smoke inhalation, despite there having been no fire reported on the island.
Of course, when we recounted the events we had suffered through, they brushed it off to confusion after head trauma, or that we had gotten our hands on some nasty drugs.
Everything seemed fine in the city, nothing had seemingly changed and life went on. We asked if they had found Luke’s body, or that of anyone we knew at all, but there was no record of Luke, or of Walter, so much as setting foot on Svalbard in the last month.
I called home, and though my family was happy to hear from me they couldn’t remember I ever had a friend named Luke, the only proof that I hadn’t gone insane was that Samantha’s memory of everything matched mine.
As night approached, Samantha sat by the window staring into the darkening sky, even with eternal darkness the moon still sets and rises. We both counted the seconds, terrified in anticipation.
Only one moon ever emerged from the horizon, and I let out a sigh of relief as I saw it. Samantha did not share my enthusiasm. I asked her what was wrong and she only pointed at it without speaking a word.
I looked up into the sky and studied the moon. At first, it seemed perfectly normal, and to the untrained eye, everything appeared to be fine, but the more I stared at it, the more I noticed the differences. The landmarks didn’t match, and the color palette was slightly off.
Samantha looked at me with terror in her eyes and confirmed what we both knew to be true.
That wasn’t our moon."	9.31	16.0	Richard Saxon	05/01/2020
What Was Brought Home	"James was back and Shelley was happy.  After all, so, so many hadn’t been lucky enough to get their husbands back.  Rita Clarence lived just two houses down, and hadn’t Shelley been looking out the window right at the time that the government-issue Ford had driven up and the army men had gotten out, straightened their uniforms, and walked up to Rita’s door?  And she wasn’t the only one.  Shelley personally knew a dozen other wives (widows now, she thought,) in Pacific Grove who had gotten notice that their husbands were dead in the jungle somewhere, and she knew that there were many others besides those.  But never her.  She had spent day after day at the window, hands resting on her gradually growing belly, waiting for that car to stop in front of their small house, but it had never come.  Time had slowly marched by, and even though James’ last letter had been months earlier, no car had come.  At least, not the car that she had been expecting.  And then, one day months later in mid-July, when a car had come, and James himself had stepped out of the back, hadn’t her emotions done a slight sidestep?  Hadn’t her expected and prepared grief felt a bit stolen from her, as if someone had played a little joke?  It had been fleeting, and true relief had flooded her as she yanked the door open and flew down the steps to him, but that feeling of being tricked was still in there, like a small pebble in her shoe.  The feeling of being tricked, and the seed of something else as well.  The knowledge that she now had a problem, one that she did not know how to handle, because the months didn’t add up properly, and she wouldn’t be able to hide it forever.
So, James was back, and that meant that she was happy.  Of course she was happy.  She had gone from a newly-wed at eighteen to a soldier’s wife, to a pregnant soldier’s wife, to a possible widow, and to a single mother in the span of twenty months.  She had been excited to get married, especially to James, who was tall and handsome.  She had thrived on how she was suddenly the center of attention among her friends, the first one to be engaged.  She was doted on at every step of the wedding planning, and that in itself was more intoxicating than the thought of actually getting married.  It had all been like a dream, and just when she had started to feel bored with the whole thing several months after she had gone from Shelley Leonetti to Shelley Hartford, James’ number had come up and off he’d gone to fight in the war.  She had cried, and she honestly did miss him, but she wasn’t terribly broken up about it.  Being the wife of a soldier made her special again, in a different way, and there were plenty of ways to stay busy while he was gone.  Plenty of people who wanted to give her some attention.  And she had just enough time to get used to the thought of this new routine being the shape of her life, for better or for worse, and then things had changed again.  James was back.  He wasn’t dead in some tunnel or rotting in a POW camp in the Far East.  He was back, and miraculously, he was uninjured.  At least, he was uninjured physically.
There was something different about him, though, and Shelley had noticed it right away.  She didn’t have a word for it at the time, but she would two years later, in 1975 when she was talking to a television salesman at the Sears and Roebuck in Monterey.  They were no longer living in Pacific Grove by that point, and had a small house within the main city limits.  James was doing well at the dealership and money wasn’t terrible, so when their small black and white Zenith had broken, Shelley didn’t think twice about going to buy a replacement.  The salesman was showing her a Sony color model, and though Shelley wasn’t exactly thrilled at the idea of buying from a Japanese company, she did have to admit it looked good.  The only rub was that this particular display television must have been mistreated by the shopping public, and the audio and picture weren’t quite on the same page.  It was a small thing, and the salesman assured her that the one she brought home wouldn’t have the problem.  “It’s a solid television, ma’am, and your family will love it.  This one just took a bit of a fall earlier today and that’s why it’s slightly desynchronized.”
Desynchronized.  That was the word.  On the television, it was so slight that you almost wouldn’t notice it after you watched it for a minute.  But it was always there.  The mouth would move, and the voice would issue a fraction of a second later.  What made it eerie was that it was almost perfect.  The picture and the audio were both exactly as they should be, but in the end, they didn’t line up.  It made everything feel like an imitation of reality instead of an actual portrayal of reality.  It was like going to see a play, and sitting in just the right seat where you could sometimes see the black-clad crew behind the baffling on the side of the stage, as they were running rigging or preparing props for the actors.  In that context, the suspension of disbelief that all plays, movies and television relied on was dented slightly.  You were aware of being an audience member, someone to whom a story was being told, and that the telling of that story was there to influence you somehow.  To make you feel happy or sad, intrigued or afraid.  That you were being manipulated.
Shelley had ended up buying the Sony, or rather, a new television of the same model without that strange decoupling of audio and visuals.  She had taken it home to James and little Brandon, two years old now.  James had set it up in a jiffy, and they had both watched The Six Million Dollar Man in glorious color that night after they had finished dinner and Brandon was in bed.  It had been a fine evening, but Shelley had looked over at her husband midway through the show, watching him as he watched Steve Austin fighting for America, and she had thought of that word again.  Desynchronized.
She had first noticed it shortly after James had stepped into (her) their house from the army car, back for the first time in a year.  When she had stopped hugging him on the front yard, they had gone inside so that he could meet Brandon, two months old and brand new in the world.  James had been back in her life for all of three minutes, and already she could feel her relief at his return slipping aside, giving way to worry.  Worry that HE WOULD KNOW.  Worry about what he would do when he did know.  She had led him to the small nursery with its new paint job (courtesy of Tim Matheson, and the paint wasn’t his only contribution to the nursery) and to the side of Brandon’s crib.  James had stood there for a moment, silent and expressionless as he looked down into the crib, and the only thought in Shelley’s mind was that HE KNEW, that it was either the shape of the eyes, or the positioning of the cheekbones, or the slope of the brow, but that whatever it was, he somehow knew.  The thought had just enough time to take traction in her mind, and she actually began to open her mouth to say something, to give voice to some excuse or explanation, and then James’ face had softened, and he said, “oh, baby.  He’s beautiful.”  He had leaned into Brandon’s crib to carefully scoop him up, and relief flooded into Shelley’s body for the second time that day.  And now, watching James as he watched the Six Million Dollar Man two years after the day he had come home, she could finally be honest with herself.  The relief at not being found out was greater than the relief of learning that her husband was still alive.  Tinged with bitterness, but greater nonetheless.
* * * * * *
At the time, Shelley had quickly moved past James’ hesitation, chalking it up to the whirlwind of leaving a warzone to come home and suddenly seeing your child for the first time.  She had moved past it, but she had not forgotten.
The next several weeks had been a bit of an adjustment, but nothing had happened that she couldn’t attribute to James simply acclimating back to civilized life.  He slept a lot, and even though he had never been someone that drank to excess, he had apparently given up alcohol entirely.  She had asked him about this and he told her, “I don’t know.  It just… tastes different now.”  She sometimes heard him talking in his sleep, which he had never done before.  These were mainly inarticulate vocalizations, but she caught names here and there, like “Tom” and “Bevington,” and one that she thought was “Big John.”
One afternoon, she was walking down the hall, a full basket of clean laundry to be folded in her arms, when she heard him crying from inside the bedroom.  The door was ajar and she nudged it open with her foot to see him lying on his back, eyes closed and hands folded on his chest, while he quietly sobbed.  She was about to leave to put the laundry down when she heard his breath catch in his throat, and then he spoke, voice wavering but clear as day.  “This wasn’t what I signed up for.”  Shelley thought that he had woken up and was speaking to her.  She quietly called his name, but he didn’t answer, and she decided that he was still asleep after all.  Still, that stuck with her for a while as she folded laundry.  James hadn’t signed up for anything.  He had been drafted.  But then Brandon was crying and she had to abandon both the laundry and this small mystery to tend to him.  It seemed like something was always pulling her away from what she was doing and making life difficult.
During the times when James was awake, his behavior was close to normal.  He had always been a quiet man, and even though he seemed slightly more muted than usual, and with that occasional hesitation, Shelley caught herself thinking that, whatever it was he had seen and done in Vietnam, he was managing quite well to put it behind him.  Several weeks after his return, the neighborhood had thrown a “welcome home” barbecue for him.  She was actually surprised by the turnout.  Almost all of their neighbors were there, as well as some of James’ friends from school.  The crowd was so large that Shelley didn’t even recognize all of them.
James had been pleasant and conversational with everyone, and Shelley hadn’t noticed more than the slightest standoffishness from him.  That being said, Shelley had been more focused on her own behavior, making sure that she and Tim Matheson both expressed just the correct amount of friendly acquaintance between them.  They had done quite well, in her opinion, except for one brief moment when they had gone into the house together, for the stated purpose of Tim helping her bring out several bags of ice for the cooler.
If this had been a year earlier, Tim, who was always handsy when alone with her, would have taken the opportunity to run his hand up the inside of her thigh, or over the rear of her jeans, but the situation had changed now, hadn’t it?  As soon as they were inside with the patio door closed behind them, he had said to her, “I need to see him.”  Before she could answer, he had turned and started walking down the hall towards the nursery, Shelley calling after him as loudly as she dared to stop, that this wasn’t the time, that people were going to find out if they weren’t careful.  Sparing a quick glance out the window to make sure no one else was heading inside, Shelley had followed after him.  When she got to the nursery, he had been standing next to the crib, exactly where James had been on the day that he had come home.  However, unlike James, Tim was more visibly impacted by the sight of the baby.  He had broken out into a big, stupid grin, and Shelley could see that tears were welling in his eyes.
“Tim, you have to go back outside.  Now,” she said, but he didn’t seem to hear her.  He just stood there, hands on the edge of the crib, looking down at the child.  Shelley grabbed his arm above the elbow.  “Do you hear me?  You are going to ruin everything if you don’t go outside right this minute!”  Just then, she heard the sound of a door closing, followed by running water.  Someone in the bathroom.  They would have had to walk past the kitchen to get there.  Had they noticed that she and Tim weren’t anywhere to be seen?
Tim had come back to himself with the sound of the latching door, and he turned to look at her.  “Okay,” he said, “but I have to see him again.”
“We can talk about that later.  Just get out of the house.”
They had been back with the group less than thirty seconds later, the tears gone from Tim’s eyes and both of them holding a large bag of ice.  James was still talking to George Brooks from up the street about job prospects, George with a can of Budweiser and James with a Coca-Cola, and hadn’t seemed to notice that they had even been inside together.  The rest of the day went by without incident, though Shelley caught Tim looking back towards the house on more than one occasion, a look of longing in his eyes.
With the amount of time that Shelley spent tending to the party, and with her distraction surrounding Tim Matheson, she didn’t have time to speak with everyone that was there that day.  After all, some of them were people she had only met once or twice around the neighborhood, and some were friends of friends, or people that James knew more than she did.  In fact, she never even noticed the one person there that neither she nor James knew.  This man was in his thirties, and he was adept at blending in without drawing attention.  He was someone that neither Shelley nor James knew, but he was also someone that Tim Matheson and George Brooks didn’t know.  Someone that wasn’t a friend of a friend, or the spouse of an acquaintance, but he was someone that knew James, or rather, knew about him.  Knew quite a lot about him, in fact.  Even if someone had directly noticed him, which no one did, that person still wouldn’t have noticed how this man was always in just the right place to see what James was doing.  He stayed at the gathering for just the correct amount of time, not being noticed when he arrived and not being missed when he left.
* * * * * *
“What have I told you about… about when I was in the war?”
She had been drifting off when his voice brought her back.  They were lying in bed, she with her back to him.  The room was dark.  She kept silent for a minute, thinking (hoping) that he was talking in his sleep again.  It had been a long day caring for Brandon, cleaning the house, doing just about everything, if she was being honest with herself.  Doing everything that needed to be done while James got to go to work and leave her to take care of the messy parts of life.  She was tired and didn’t care much what James had to say about Vietnam.  He’d been back for three years and had barely said two words about it.  Why now, of all times?
“Shelley?”
“Hmm?”  Trying to sound more tired than she was, trying to dissuade further conversation.
“The war.  What have I told you about it?”
He apparently wasn’t going to drop it.  “Not much,” she said, doing her best to balance just the right amount of curtness and fatigue in her voice.  She didn’t turn to him.
A few moments passed, and she felt sleep closing in.  Just as she was about to go under, he spoke again.  “I can’t remember when I forgot.”
This was strange enough to bring her back again.  “What?”
“I don’t remember much of anything.  I can’t… I can’t tell if I forgot when I was over there or sometime after I got back.  I never told you anything?”
“Not really.”  She hesitated.  “Just some names.”
She heard/felt him move a bit.  “Names?”
“Yeah, just names.  ‘Big John’ and ‘Burlington’ or something like that.  A few others.”
More silence.  “I don’t remember.”
“Well, you didn’t bring them up much.”
“No, it’s not that I don’t remember saying the names.  I mean, I don’t remember saying them, but that’s not what I mean.  I don’t know who those people are.  I can’t remember.”
Her interest was waning again.  “Well, it was war, James.  There was a lot going on.  We should get some sleep.  I have a million things I need to do tomorrow while you’re spending your day drinking coffee and selling cars.”
She closed her eyes, glad that the conversation was over.  She really did have a lot to do tomorrow.  There was laundry, grocery shopping, taking Brandon for a checkup at Doctor Swanson’s office.  And let’s not forget about talking to Tim about fixing their fence.  Dealing with him had been an increasingly exhausting task over the last few years, navigating through all of the things that they had to talk about while keeping him from talking about what he wanted to talk about.  When no one was around, he would talk about how he’d see Brandon getting older and that he was feeling time slipping away.  Time that he wanted to be with Brandon.  To be with her.  She had made it abundantly clear that there was no place in her life for him except as a handyman, and no place in Brandon’s life for him at all.  Tim would always relent, but she would see in his eyes that he was already thinking of how he’d circle back to the issue.  It was exhausting, but it was also a tad concerning, because that look he had was more and more desperate as time went on.  If it was up to her, she would have cut him out of their life completely, but James had known him for a long time and knew that Tim needed the money, and James hadn’t picked up on her suggestions to go with someone else for repair work moving forward.  Besides, it wasn’t like she could just come out and say why she didn’t want Tim around anymore.
These thoughts slowly became fuzzier and more meandering, and she was only aware that she had almost fallen asleep when James spoke again.
“I remember basic training, I remember all the guys I met there.  I remember shipping out and landing in Saigon.  I remember the first few months.  Being in the city with some other guys, running checkpoints.  I definitely remember coming home to visit you, and then… only snippets.  Only… flashes.  Something about me and some guys going somewhere else, and feeling relief about that, but…”
“James.”  Exasperation in her voice.  No answer from him.  She turned over, seeing his outline in the darkness as he sat up against the headboard, looking at nothing at all.  “James,” she said again, louder.
He jumped a little and turned to her.  “Sorry.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.  That’s all over.  I’m sure you don’t want to relive it, and I know that I don’t want to.  Think about how hard it was for me.  Here, alone, pregnant.  Not sure if you were alive or dead.  It’s too much for me to go through, and it’s too late for us to be talking about anything.  Go to sleep.”
He hesitated for a moment and then leaned towards her, kissing her forehead.  “I’m sorry, sweetheart.  Get some rest.”
She turned her back to him again, still irritated, but with a dash of pride.  She knew how to work him.  She knew that he truly cared for her, and all it took was to make him feel like what he was doing was causing her grief, and he’d back off.  In fact, she felt better than she had before.  This little exchange had been given her a measure of confidence that would be sure to come in handy tomorrow, when she’d be dealing with a slightly less malleable male personality.  This led her back to thinking about the next day and all that it would entail, which wove her down the road from consciousness to unconsciousness.
* * * * * *
James had started drinking not long after.
* * * * * *
He was almost the perfect type of drunk husband, Shelley had thought sardonically as she had looked down at him, passed out on the bedroom floor two years later.  He didn’t yell, he didn’t hit, and he didn’t go sleeping around.  He just opened a bottle sometime in the afternoon or evening, sat down at the small kitchen table, started quietly drinking, and didn’t stop until he was drunk and then fell asleep.  Not ideal in many respects, but not bad, considering.  Besides, it gave her time when she didn’t have to be around him.  That desynchronization had been getting worse over the last year or so, and it gave her the willies.
Last night had been slightly different than usual, because he hadn’t stayed quiet like he normally did.  Sometime around seven, he had roused himself enough to start drinking even more, and then he started crying.  He had started talking as well.  It was disjointed and incoherent, but Shelley had heard him from the living room, where she was watching television with Brandon.  Brandon was getting upset, and Shelley was doing her best to distract him.  After all, she didn’t want two people crying in the house.
She had continued to turn up the volume to drown out James’ sobbing, but she had still heard some of what he was saying.  He was in the kitchen, talking to no one in particular, and she had again heard one of the names that he mentioned sometimes.  “Thomas.”
He had stopped crying a half-hour later, and shortly after, she had heard him drag himself up from the table and shamble down the hall into the bedroom.  She and Brandon had finished watching Captain Kangaroo and then she had put him to bed.  He had school in the morning, and was already up later than usual.
Shelley had left James where he was, curled up on the floor on the side of the bed, his white work shirt halfway buttoned and his tie loose and hanging over his shoulder.  She had slept peacefully, herself, and James was gone when she woke up.  “That’s just fine,” she thought as she stretched out, enjoying the full width of the bed.  She looked at the little clock on the nightstand and saw that she still had some time before she had to get Brandon ready for school.  She lay where she was for a few minutes, enjoying the quiet and the solitude.  Besides, James would benefit from having time to take a shower before she got up and had to deal with him.
But when she went into the kitchen, clad in her robe, she realized that James wasn’t in the shower.  He was sitting at the table, motionless with a cup of coffee in front of him, still wearing his clothes from the previous night.  She stopped when she saw him, startled.  After a moment, she started forward again and walked past him to make herself a cup.  As she was at the counter with her back turned to him, she heard him timidly say, “good morning” from behind her.
“You scared Brandon last night,” she replied coldly.
“I suppose I probably did.  I’m sorry.”
“I’m sure you are,” she said mildly.
No response.
She finished pouring her coffee and then turned around to look at him.  He was hunched forward, resting his elbows on the table and generally looking worked over.  There were bags under his eyes.  “At least he buttoned his shirt,” she thought.
“How long is this going to go on?”
“I’m sorry,” he said again, slouching a bit further down.
“You should be.  The drinking is one thing, even though you did go through more than you usually do.  But crying like that in front of your son?  That’s disgraceful.  You were a soldier, for Christ’s sake.”
He slumped even deeper.
“What do you have to cry about anyway?  You have a good job and a good family.  You’re living the American dream, James.”
“I just…”
“You just what?”
He hesitated.  “I just sometimes can’t stop thinking about things.  About the war.  I start trying to remember, and I can’t remember anything, but I still feel bad.”
She stepped over to the table and sat down across from him.
“James, you know I love you.  But this has got to stop.  You have to let it go.  Get on with your life so we can get on with ours.”  She looked at the clock above the sink.  “Besides, you need to get to work.”
“Yeah,” he said.  He reached for his cup and drained it, and then pulled himself up from the chair.  As he was walking away, she called out to him.
“Honey?”
He stopped and slowly turned around to look at her, his eyes downcast.
“You really have a lot to be thankful for,” she said.
He managed a weak smile, and then went to get ready for work.
* * * * * *
The knock on the door came at about noon that same day.  She had been drinking a cup of coffee at the table and listening to the radio.  She wasn’t expecting anyone, and her first thought was that it was Tim, who was someone that she absolutely did not want to deal with, so she hadn’t stood up until the second knock came, a bit louder and more insistent.  With a small sigh of exasperation, she went into the living room and opened the door, already preparing to give Tim a piece of her mind about how inappropriate (and how stupid) it was for him to come by in the middle of the day.
Instead, what waited for her when she pulled open the door were two unfamiliar men, both appearing to be in their forties and wearing well-worn suits.  She stopped where she was, slightly taken aback and with her mouth partway open to deliver a lashing.
“Hello,” said one of them, a tall, thin man with a mustache and a receding hairline.  “Is James Hartford here?”
“I’m sorry?”
The man smiled disarmingly.  “James Hartford.  Is he home right now?  My associate and I here would like to talk to him.”
She had regained a bit of her composure by that point, enough to where she was irritated at having her day interrupted.  “I’m afraid I can’t help you.  You’ll have to leave…”
“We’re with the police, ma’am,” said the man, still smiling and looking a little apologetic.  “Monterey PD.  I’m Detective Albertson and this is Detective Phillips.  We just need to talk to your… husband?… for a minute or two.  Is he around?”
“Oh,” she replied, taken aback.  “No, I’m afraid he’s at work, over at the Ford dealership in Seaside.  What is this all about?”
Albertson looked briefly over his shoulder at Phillips, who was also smiling a little now.  He turned back to Shelley.  “I can assure you, it’s almost certainly nothing at all.  James works locally, then?”
“Yes.  He’s worked there for about five years.”
“He’s been at work this week?  No trips out of town recently?  Didn’t head out to, oh, I don’t know.  Arizona?  New Mexico?  Anywhere over around there?”
“Arizona?  No, not at all.  Our last vacation was a few years back and that was just up to Oregon.  He hasn’t left town at all.  What… New Mexico?”
“Well, that’s just fine with us, then,” he said with a hint of a chuckle in his voice.  “We’ll go have a quick chat with him, but trust me, ma’am, this is nothing to get worried about.  Thanks for your time.”  With that, he smiled at her again and the two of them walked unhurriedly down the steps and to their car, which was parked in front of the house.  Shelley watched them for a moment and then closed the door, feeling a little untethered and with a slight frown on her face.  She heard the engine start up and looked out the small side window as they drove off.  Strange thoughts were bouncing around in her mind, and she was still looking out the window several seconds later when she noticed a second car that hadn’t caught her attention before.  This was parked on the far side of the street and several houses down.  A beige Ford sedan.  It started up and made a wide U-turn in the street to continue down the road after the detectives, accelerating slightly to catch up to them.
She stood at the window, staring out into the street after the vehicles, her frown deepening.
* * * * * *
She was on him as soon as he walked through the door, even though he wasn’t home much later than normal.  He stiffly walked past her and her barrage of whos and whats and wheres, and mechanically lowered himself down onto the couch at the other end of the living room.  He sat, staring ahead vacantly, as she stood above him and continued to ask questions, neither of them noticing that Brandon was peeking around the corner from the hall, a worried expression on his face.  The pitch, volume, and rapidity of Shelley’s questions slowly increased as he continued to stare at the far wall, apparently unaware of her presence.
She finally realized that she wasn’t getting through and, not without effort, calmed herself down, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.  Renewed, she looked down at him again.  “James,” she said calmly.
Nothing.
“James,” she said, with a bit more vigor, and when he still didn’t answer, she leaned forward, still in full control, and slapped him across the face, hard.  Not in anger, she thought to herself.  Just to get through to him.
His head reeled for the briefest moment and then snapped back, and now he was looking at her.  Shelley stepped back, surprised by the flash of anger she saw there, but it was gone as soon as she could register it, and now he just looked worn out.  Worn out, and sad.
“James,” said again, “why were the police here today?”
He kept looking at her for a moment, and she was again aware of how that hesitation, that desynchronization, was getting more noticeable.
“Thomas Hughes.  I remember him now.”
She didn’t respond.  This was all so out of context that she couldn’t think of anything to say.
“I had forgotten him, but now I remember.  I saw him almost every day for six months there at the end, right before I came home.  I think.  I remember… I remember talking to him.  Nothing serious, just chatting.  But all the time.  Do you understand, Shelley?  I talked to him all of the time.”
“What are you talking about?”
He stood up and started walking around the room absent-mindedly while he talked.  “He was someone I knew in the war.  Someone in Vietnam.  But not in Saigon.  I know it wasn’t in Saigon, it was sometime after that.  And we weren’t in uniform.  I remember joking with him.. something about what we were wearing.  Looking like pilots?  Or astronauts or something?”
He stopped pacing for a second, his hands bunched into fists down at his side.
“FUCK!” he shouted, and suddenly swept a table lamp across the room, where it shattered against the wall.  Shelley uttered a tiny scream of surprise.  Peripherally, she heard the sound of small, running feet receding down the hallway.
“WHY CAN’T I REMEMBER?” James continued.  He was pacing again, but it was different.  It was less like he was being hunted and more like he was an animal in a cage, looking for a weak bar.  “There are still just bits and pieces, but I KNOW that there’s more in there!  And why the fuck can I remember him now, when I couldn’t just yesterday?  What the fuck is going on?”
He stopped by the front door and braced his hands on it, his head lowered.  He was breathing heavily, and his whole body looked tense, like he was trying to push the door over.  Shelley stood still, not sure if she should go to him or stay where she was.  Or if she should try to retreat without him noticing her.
“You know what the thing is?  I was thinking about him last night.  I couldn’t have told you if you had asked me then, or this morning, but I know I was thinking of him last night, right before I passed out.”
Shelley didn’t know what to say.  Distractedly, she noticed that her lips felt numb.  She felt rooted where she was, standing with her hands clasped together at her beltline.  Her face hurt and she realized that her jaw was clenched.  Without knowing that she was going to say anything, she again asked, “Why were the police here, James?”
He didn’t move, but he changed.  The strength and tension went out of his body, and now he was merely leaning against the door for support.  She saw his shoulders rise and fall slowly as he drew a deep breath and sighed.  Without turning to her, he said, “Because Thomas Hughes is dead.  He’s dead, and someone thinks that I killed him.”
* * * * * *
The rest came out fairly smoothly, at least compared to the explosive beginning.  They had relocated to the kitchen, where, after briefly checking on Brandon, Shelley had sat across from James at the table while he told her everything that had happened.  He had been at work with a client when Albertson and Phillips had shown up and asked to talk to him.  They had inquired about his whereabouts during the week.  James had told them that he had been in town, at home and at work.  Neither detective had come across as taking the investigation seriously, and had relaxed even further when George Brooks, the owner of the dealership, had confirmed James’ accounting.
The only rough patch had been when they had asked James if he knew a man named Thomas Hughes.  James had replied that he’d never heard of him.  They had been about to leave a minute later (after Phillips took James’ card, mentioning that he himself would be in the market for a new car soon,) when James suddenly gasped and slumped to the floor.
“It was like he was suddenly just back in my brain,” he told Shelley.  “Like there was a hole in there where he had been, and then all of a sudden, someone decided to take him off the shelf and shove him right back into my memories.”
Everyone present (Albertson, Phillips and Brooks) had rushed over to make sure James was alright.  He was far from it.  He sat on the floor, struggling to get his legs to work, sweating and gasping for air.  He finally managed to stammer out, “Oh God, oh God, OH GOD!  Thomas!”  This had, of course, initiated a whole new series of questions.  Even after he had calmed down, James couldn’t tell the police much, only that he had known Hughes back in the war and must have forgotten about him in the intervening years.  However, this also resulted in the detectives giving James more information about what had happened.
Late the previous night, police in Phoenix, Arizona had been sent to a homicide.  The killer had fled the scene.  They had responded, and, after searching the area, had spoken with Carol Hughes, who had been married to Thomas for two years.  Thomas had been dead in his bed.  Strangled.
“She told the cops out there that she woke up out of a sound sleep to a struggle in the bed.  Thomas was fighting with someone.  They didn’t give me a play by play, not at first, but it sounds like it was ugly.  Somewhere in the middle of the struggle, Thomas shouted my name.  I pressed them a bit, and that one detective, the taller one…”
“Albertson?” Shelley asked.
“Yeah, him.  He said that Carol had seen Thomas suddenly stop fighting, and he said, ‘Oh my God, it’s you!  Hartford!’  And then he said…”  James stopped, staring down at his hands, clasped on the table.  Shelley waited.
“Well, anyway, I guess the guy took that chance to grab Thomas and killed him pretty quick after that.  Thomas’ wife said that the killer walked out of the room afterwards and when she finally got the nerve to go out to the phone, he was gone.  It was dark and she never really got a good look at him.  The Phoenix cops got in touch with the army and checked some records, and then got Albertson and the other guy out here to come see if I was at home.”  He looked up at Shelley and spread his hands in an “I don’t know” gesture.
Shelley was silent.  The whole thing was so strange that she could only sit there.
He took a long, shuddering sigh and then stood up.  “I better go check on the kid,” he said, and started towards the hallway.
Something surfaced in her mind and she called out to him.  “James, what else did he say?  You started to tell me that he said something else.  Right before… right before the man strangled him.”
He grimaced and turned away from her, tension bunching his shoulders.  “It doesn’t matter.  I didn’t have anything to do with it.  Hell, I didn’t even remember the guy until today.”
“Tell me.”
He ignored her and walked out of the room.
* * * * * *
Later, in bed.  Both of them lying there, neither sleeping.  James drunk, but not blacked out.
“Tell me what he said.”
“What who said?” he responded, slurred.
“Don’t play dumb with me.  Tell me what he said.”
He didn’t respond, but she heard the quiet sounds of him starting to cry.  She persisted.
“Tell me, James.”
“Just leave me alone,” he said, rolling over away from her.  She felt the small shaking in the bed as he sobbed.
“I need you to tell me,” she said and sat up.  “This involves me now.  Involves Brandon.  How did the police know to call the army to get your information?  I don’t know what else you’re not telling me about this, but you’re going to tell me this.  God damn you, James, you will tell me.”
He kept crying, but she didn’t lie back down.  She let him sob, thinking about how different he was from who she had married.  He had been strong, and handsome.  Now he was miserable.
“Tell me.”
He sighed through the sobbing and then said something that was too quiet for her to hear.
“What?”
He coughed, trying to find his voice.  “He said…”  Another cough, and then he slowly got control of his breathing.
“He said, ‘you bastard, I saw you die back there in the jungle.’”
* * * * * *
“Well, this is really damn weird, isn’t it?”
“What do you mean?” she said into the phone receiver, though she knew where he was going with it.
“That’s how you’re going to play it?  Like you don’t know exactly what you’re doing?”
“Tim, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  She felt her face getting hot.
He chuckled.  “New cabinets, you say.  Measurements for new cabinets.”
“That’s right.  James wanted me to have you come take the measurements today so that we could start looking at options.”
“You know, I believe he probably did think it was his idea,” Tim said, and Shelley heard him laugh again.  Her face got redder.
“I’m not sure what your problem is with this…” she began, but he cut her off.
“Oh, stop it,” he said angrily, and she stopped.  “How many years did I try, Shelley?  Six?  No, he’s seven now, isn’t he?”
She didn’t answer.
“Seven years I tried to be with you, to be with Brandon, and you made it pretty clear that you wanted nothing to do with me.  Seven goddamn years.  And now, now that I’ve finally built something new for myself, now is when you’re gonna start this shit up again?  I can’t believe you, I really can’t.”
She was angry herself, now, but kept her voice in check.  “Look, Tim, you can project on me all you want, but I just want you to help me with measuring the cabinets.  Can you come by and do that?”
“Your goddamn tenacity,” he said after a moment.  “What was it?  Finally get tired of his drinking?  He doesn’t keep it under wraps as much as you might think, you know.  Then again, I don’t think that’s actually what it is after all.  Because it’s not really about him, is it?  No, it never is.  Not with you.”
She was biting her lip now.  There were tears forming at the corners of her eyes, and her vision was going red.
“What happened?  Did you wake up one morning and realize that you’re just a small part of the world?  Did you realize it’s been too long since someone wanted you, someone that you could turn down?  Get tired of the humdrum little life you’ve got for yourself?”
“Shut up, Tim.”
“What was it that was the final straw?  Did you see the first hint of crow’s feet?  Maybe realized that you don’t look quite the same in the mirror as you used to?  So you just decided that you’d give me a call, get me on the hook again.  Well, fuck that.  I wanted you, Shelley.  I wanted to be with you, but you made your choice, and I made mine.  I moved on.  I don’t need you anymore.  I have Linda and I have my own life.”
“Shut up, Tim!”
“You haven’t called me for jack shit in more than a year.  You’re polite when we run into each other, if James is around.  Without him, you’d probably never even look my way.  And now you want to play your ace up the sleeve.  Call in your backup plan so you can feel good about yourself again.  Well, guess what?  I’m not your fucking puppet.”
“Oh, we know exactly what you are!” she yelled into the phone, and then stopped herself, startled.  He didn’t say anything for a minute.
“You know what?  You’re right.  We do know.  And we’re the only ones that know, aren’t we?  Because it wouldn’t be good for either of us if anyone else were to find out.  So how about you deal with your own life and let me live mine.”
The phone clicked in her ear, and she screamed her rage into the empty house.

The police talked to James again in December.  Phillips was still there, but not Albertson.  Shelley didn’t know if he had retired or transferred (or died, for all she cared) in the two and a half years it had been since they’d last been by.  It was a cold Saturday morning, dark and raining outside.  James was in the living room, doing a puzzle on the floor with Brandon, now eight years old.  She was in the kitchen, washing dishes, when she saw a car pull up outside.  Phillips and another man got out and walked up to the house.  She turned off the faucet, but didn’t leave the sink.  She just stood there, listening.
The knock came, and James answered it.  She stayed at the sink as she heard him open the door, and then the muted sounds of conversation.  A minute later, he came into the kitchen.
“Hey, I’ve got to go for a bit.”
“What is it?”  Not turning to him.
“Um… it’s the police.  I have to go answer some questions.”
“About what?”
“I don’t know.  They said it shouldn’t take long.”
“Fine.  I’ll just stay here and do everything.”  She turned on the faucet again.  She didn’t look up when she heard the car outside start up and drive off, but she did look up when she heard the second engine, just in time to see a beige Ford sedan driving away.
* * * * * *
It had been Gabriel Bevington.  Six days ago in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  There was no wife this time.  Gabriel lived alone.  The small apartment had been trashed during the apparent struggle, and a broken chair leg had been shoved into his eye.  There was a partial print on it, not enough to return a match.  Nothing had been stolen and Gabriel had been known and liked in the community, so a detective out there had started looking at other possibilities besides a botched robbery.  He ended up getting Gabriel’s army records, and then came across Thomas Hughes’ name.  And James’.  The partial print still wasn’t sufficient to be a match, but there was enough there to show that it might be the same as the one in James’ army file.  But it just wasn’t possible.  It was over a thousand miles between here and there.  There were no witnesses that saw the killer, but there were people that could attest to James being in and around Monterey all week.  So the police had let him go.
Shelley sat at the table, watching James go through the same thing as before.  He remembered Gabriel, but it was the first time he’d remembered him since Vietnam.  Him and Gabriel and Thomas.  All part of something that he couldn’t quite piece together.  Something away from the warzone, something out of uniform.  Something he couldn’t remember, but he was sure, he was positive, that he’d somehow been thinking of Gabriel recently, even though he didn’t remember him until today.  He just couldn’t piece it all together.
Shelley sat and listened, but she was also thinking.  Doing the math.  Thinking of how it had been just about six days back that James had been on his last bad drunk, crying and gibbering for the first time in years.  The first time since Thomas Hughes had died, if you got right down to it.
* * * * * *
She had been loading groceries into the trunk of the car, Brandon already seatbelted in the back seat, when she saw Tim walking across the parking lot to the front of the Lucky’s.  It had been a nightmare of a day, and she was tired and angry.  Sick kid to deal with, house to clean, groceries to buy, then dinner to cook.  The weather was beautiful, out of place in early January, but she didn’t get to enjoy it.  No, never her.  She had to be the responsible one.  The one that cleaned up after everyone else.  And today was only Tuesday.  The whole week of undeserved drudgery stretched in front of her.
She had just finished putting the last bag in the trunk (with a bit more force than was necessary) when she had looked up, wiping a light sweat from her brow, and had seen Tim.  Tim and that woman he was with.  They hadn’t seen her, and she felt a touch of relief at that.  She was in a faded plaid shirt and old jeans, which she had been wearing when she was cleaning the floor earlier after Brandon had sicked up on it.
Shelley stood at the back of the car, looking at Tim and the woman (Linda, she remembered now,) watching them.  They were walking together, not exactly smiling, not holding hands or laughing, but with a comfort and ease that made it obvious they were happy.  Happy and together, out enjoying their lives on a beautiful day.  Shelley turned away and closed the trunk.  Hard.
She walked around to the driver’s side to get in.  As she reached for the door handle, she noticed that there was a small spot of dried vomit on her sleeve and she half-grimaced, half-sneered.  Right before she got into the car, she looked back towards Tim and Linda just as they were about to enter the store.  Some trick of circumstance caused Tim to look back at the same moment, and their eyes locked.  He didn’t exactly smile, but he did hesitantly raise a hand in a brief wave.  Linda noticed him stopping and turned back as well, looking at Shelley.
In the fraction of a second that they stood there, looking back at her from fifty feet across the parking lot, Tim with his hand up and the two of them together, Shelley had time to look at her own life and compare it to what she had wanted, and what she knew that she deserved.  Not in terms of specifics, but in terms of emotions.  She had deserved more, and other people had taken it from her.  James with his weakness.  Tim with his selfishness.  Even Brandon, by merely existing, and that fact wasn’t her fault either, she told herself.  It was unfair that she would get caught in the middle of this, her life now nothing more than standing in a parking lot with vomit on her shirt.
The rage and self-pity welled up inside of her, and the world started to spin.  She closed the car door and took a few steps towards Tim and Linda (to do what, she didn’t know,) when she suddenly stopped.  Something had whispered in her head, some voice from deep within the darkest part of her mind.  It wasn’t whispering in words, but it had told her something important, nonetheless.  That thing was blurred and amorphous, but she knew that there was a more defined shape to it floating deeper down.  She didn’t yet know what it was, but seeing that initial hint of it and brought to her a sense of peace, and a sense of hope.   A slight smile spread across her lips.  She raised her hand back to Tim, and then got into her car and drove home.
* * * * * *
It took her several days to figure out exactly how she would have to make it happen, but that was fine with her.  Even though Brandon was still sick, even though James was moping around as he always did during the evenings, even though she had the banality of her normal life and obligations to get through, she felt buoyant.  Almost giddy at times.  Because she knew that she had a way out.  She was still setting it up in her mind, but as each new piece clicked into place, as she found a workaround for each new potential obstacle that she thought of, she felt her heart skip a beat in anticipation.
There was one point on Thursday afternoon, as she was scrubbing the shower, when she heard Brandon weakly call out to her from his bedroom, where he had been dozing, to ask if she was okay.  It was only then that she realized that she had been audibly giggling.  She called out that she was fine and that he should get back to sleep, and then she continued cleaning, a smile on her face.
She knew it was going to be tricky, and that she’d have to take things one step at a time to make sure that she didn’t get ahead of herself.  There was one part in particular that would need to be timed perfectly, and would take some emotional strength on her part, but she knew she could do it.  After all, she was fighting for herself.  For her life.  For what she deserved.  She could be strong for that.  For herself.
She had trouble sleeping on Thursday night, but not because she was anxious.  She was simply too excited to get more than a few minutes of rest at a time.  She’d start to drift off, and then would slip into a half-dream state where she couldn’t tell if she was still awake or not.  Sometimes she’d dream that she was still in bed, waiting for the morning.  Other times she’d think it was the next day and she was going over the preparation, or actually taking the steps.  Either way, her excitement would get the best of her, and then she’d be back awake in bed, James lightly snoring next to her, and she’d think to herself, “This is the last night.  This is the last time I have to put up with him.  What he’s done to me.  What they’ve all done to me.”
The night slowly progressed, and when she became aware that the sky was getting light outside of the window, she abandoned any thoughts of getting more sleep.  She knew that she’d be tired, but it was all going to be worth it.  She got up, took a shower, put on her makeup (a bit more than usual, though she didn’t really notice; she was feeling too good to notice,) and then started breakfast.  She couldn’t start the actual preparation until after James was at work, and she wanted to keep herself busy until then.  She thought that if she tried to sit still, she’d explode out of her skin.
The morning routine seemed to pass slower than it ever had.  James eventually woke up, had breakfast, took a shower, and left for work.  At one point he said to her, “you seem happier than usual today.”
“Well, I guess I just woke up on the right side of the bed today,” she responded, chipper.
He smiled over his toast and eggs, “that’s good.”  After a moment, he added, “I know that I’m sometimes not easy on you and Brandon.  I… I love you both very much, and I need to try to focus on that instead of… instead of anything else that might be getting me down.”
She walked over from the counter, where she had been drying dishes, and gave him a quick kiss on the forehead.  “Don’t worry about me, honey.  All you have to do is be yourself.”
Fifteen minutes later, he was off to work.  Shelley checked in on Brandon, who was feeling better (his vomiting had finally stopped) but was still too weak to go to school.  She expressed the proper amount of maternal concern, and assured him that everything would be better before next week came around.  Inside, she was glad that he was still feeling sick.  It wouldn’t matter too much if he was home or at school today, but taking the time to help him get ready and drive him over would take time out of her day that she wanted to spend on other things.  Besides, it would also make things easier tonight.
* * * * * *
Shelley was back home in under three hours.  She walked in the front door, a paper bag in her arm, and called out cautiously for Brandon.  After not hearing an answer, she put the bag down, locked the door, and then picked the bag back up.  She took it into the kitchen and emptied its meager contents onto the table, looking the three items over.
There hadn’t been a tremendous amount that she’d had to do, and she should have been home within an hour, two at the most.  But things at Tim’s place had taken longer than normal.  When she had pulled up and parked half a block down from his house, she had seen two vehicles in the driveway.  She recognized Tim’s Chevy pickup, and assumed that the other car, a Volvo station wagon, belonged to Linda.  That wouldn’t do at all, both of them being home, so she sat in the car and waited.  Less than five minutes later, Tim had walked out the front door and turned back so he could kiss Linda, who had followed him to the threshold.  He had gotten into his truck, backed onto the roadway, and drove off, waving his hand out the window at the house as he left.  Linda had waved back, smiling, and then gone inside and closed the door.
Partially obscured by the Volvo, Shelley could see a small scattering of tools at the top of the driveway, near the house.  Tim’s tools, whatever he hadn’t needed to take with him that day.  She sat in the car for a minute, weighing the chances.  It was likely that she could get what she needed and then leave without being noticed, but there was a lot hinging on this, and she didn’t want to take any chances.  So, she continued to wait, humming distracted fragments of melodies, tapping her fingers on her leg, and watching the front door of Tim’s house intently.
Sometime\ later, Shelley started awake to the sound of a car engine.  She looked around wildly for a moment, forgetting where she was.  She saw the Volvo back out of the driveway, shift gears, and then begin to move in her direction.  Remembrance flooded her mind, and she quickly scooted lower in the seat, trying to make sure she wasn’t seen.  Her heart was racing.  “How long have I been asleep?” she thought as the station wagon drove past her.  Anyone could have walked by and seen her, and this was a small enough neighborhood that she certainly would have been recognized.  She stayed there, slumped down in the driver’s seat, her knees shoved uncomfortably into the steering column, and tried to catch her breath.  After a minute, she regained some of her composure.  She raised her head and looked around to make sure no one else was out and about, and then she opened the door and stepped out onto the sidewalk.  As she did so, her neck and lower back screamed at the sudden change of position and she had to fight the urge to stand on her toes and stretch out her aching muscles right then and there.  That would be quite a sight, she thought irritably.
Doing her best to ignore her body’s complaints, she quickly but casually (she hoped) strode across the roadway and over to the foot of Tim’s driveway.  She looked around again, trying her best to appear as commonplace as possible, and then walked up the slight grade to the point where the driveway met the front of the house.  She looked down at the discarded tools and immediately saw what she was looking for: a standard claw hammer.  It was the type of thing that you’d see in any handyman’s toolbox or on any carpenter’s toolbelt.
She started to bend down to pick it up, and then stopped, her breath catching in her throat.  She was still recovering from the fogginess of sleep and the racing bump of adrenaline from when she had awoken.  Internally, she scolded herself for being so careless.  She looked around a bit and saw a pair of dirty, used workman’s gloves.  She grabbed those and put them on, and then picked up the hammer and quickly returned to her car.
The hammer now lay on the kitchen table in front of her, alongside a small bottle of liquid children’s Benadryl, and a significantly larger bottle of Jack Daniel’s No. 7.  She had left the gloves in her car, where they wouldn’t be noticed until she needed them later.  She looked down at the three items, unaware that she was grinning and slowly shifting her weight from foot to foot.  “Three for three,” she thought, and now her grin broke into a full, toothy smile.
“Three for three.”
* * * * * *
James got home at his normal time that evening.  Shelley was sitting on the couch, reading a John D. MacDonald novel and trying her best to not appear how she felt, as if she was visibly vibrating.  She responded briefly to his “hello,” and again to tell him Brandon was still feeling sick, when James asked.  Shelley kept her eyes on her book and did her best to feign interest in it, though she did look up briefly after he walked past her and into the kitchen.  She heard his footsteps on the linoleum as he walked towards the sink, maybe for a glass of water, and then she heard them stop.
“Hey honey, what’s this hammer doing here?”
She took a quiet, shallow breath to calm herself, and then responded, “What hammer?”
She heard him walking back and focused on keeping her eyes on her book.  This was one of the important parts.  A moment later, she could see him standing next to the couch, just at the edge of her peripheral vision.  “This hammer,” he said, and she had to force herself not to grin.  Shelley looked at James, who was holding up the hammer by the shaft as he peered down at her with a confused expression on his face.
“Oh, I found it outside.  I think Tim might have left it here last time he was by.”
James’ face got even more confused.  “Tim?  I don’t think I’ve seen him here for a while now.”
She turned back to her book.  “Well, I don’t know then.  It was outside along the side of the house, and I didn’t want to leave it there, so I brought it inside.”
He stood where he was for a minute, looking at the hammer quizzically, and then walked back into the kitchen.  Shelley kept pretending to read the book, her heart beating hard in her chest like her own internal hammer.  She heard a sound that was likely James putting the hammer on the table or the counter, and then the slight creak as a cupboard opened, followed by the faucet.  She allowed herself another quiet, satisfied sigh, and a small, secret smile.
* * * * * *
Brandon was asleep in bed, helped along by the shot of Benadryl and whiskey that Shelley had given him half an hour before.  This hadn’t been hard.  James was already half in the bag, sitting at the kitchen table and staring a thousand miles away at nothing in particular.  She had simply walked past him, retrieved a glass from the cupboard, and mixed the concoction right there at the counter, her back to him.
Brandon was actually already asleep when she went into his room, riding the erratic cycle of waking and dozing that accompanies a bad flu, but she didn’t want to risk him coming to at the wrong moment as the evening progressed.  She gently shook him awake and gave him the glass.
“Here, honey, take this.  It’ll help you feel better in the morning.”
Brandon had briefly sniffed at the contents of the glass as he lay in bed, hair sticking up in every direction, but had swallowed it, grimacing, after some urging from his mother.  He had laid back down, Shelley smoothing his hair and giving him a quick kiss on the forehead, and then she had left the room, already forgetting about him as she focused on what had to happen next.
She returned quietly to the kitchen and looked in.  James was exactly where he was, looking into space.  There was an empty glass on the table and a mostly empty bottle of Johnny Walker next to it.  She smiled in approval and walked past him to the counter, busying herself by putting dishes away from the drying rack.
“When are you going to give that hammer to Tim?” she asked, striving to sound nonchalant.  She heard James shift slightly in his chair and mutter a slurred, “hmmm?”
“I asked when you’re bringing Tim’s hammer back,” she replied, and then, “you know, you’re right.  We haven’t seen him in a while, have we?”
James didn’t respond for a moment, but she heard him opening the bottle and pouring a bit more Johnny Walker into his glass.  “No, I guess not,” he said absentmindedly.
She turned back as he was screwing the top back onto the empty bottle.  Or rather, as he was trying to screw it back onto the bottle.  She could see that he knew how to do it, but his hands were having a bit of trouble performing the motions.  Shelley smiled to herself, appreciating that things were moving forward properly, and also taking a small, simpler enjoyment at watching him struggle.
“Oh, it looks like that one’s empty,” she said and plucked the bottle off of the table.  James didn’t seem to notice.  He was looking down at his glass, held in both hands and with a small amount of alcohol in it.  Shelley put the empty bottle on the counter, opened the cupboard above the sink, the one that she kept her spices in and which James almost never used, and retrieved the mostly-fresh bottle of Jack Daniels.  It was full, except for the small slug that she had poured into Brandon’s Benadryl.  She also filled a fresh glass with water and took that and the whiskey to the kitchen table.  She put the bottle down near James, and then sat down across from him with her water, which she took a small sip of.
“It would really be nice to have Tim over at some point, don’t you think?” she said.
James drank the last Johnny Walker from his glass and didn’t say anything.  He was still looking downward at nothing in particular.
“I mean, it’s just been a while since we’ve had company over.  Especially Tim.  We used to see him all the time.”
“Yeah,” James said.  “I guess we did.”  He seemed to notice the bottle of Jack Daniels and looked at it with a puzzled expression.
“You’ve known him a long time, haven’t you?”
James reached for the Jack and mumbled, “Sure have,” as he began the process of opening it and pouring himself a drink.
Shelley smiled, concealing her grin with her hands and glass as she sipped water.
* * * * * *
The rest of the evening had progressed exactly as she had hoped that it would.  James kept drinking, and with some slight and strategic direction on her part, had fallen victim to nostalgia as hard as he was falling victim to the whiskey.  Soon, he was running on his own steam, talking about nonsense from years past, most of his words slurred to the point of unintelligibility.  She had made sure that he stayed focused on Tim, on how they had been friends in school, on how much he appreciated him and missed seeing him.  James had started to slip off a few times, lowering slowly from a sitting position to leaning his elbows on the table, then trying to rest his head on it, but Shelley had been attentive and had kept him awake, shaking him or calling out his name.  She even poured his last few drinks when he was having too much trouble doing it on his own.  She didn’t know exactly how drunk he would need to be for this to work, but she recalled that, during the previous two instances, he had been very drunk indeed.
James had finally passed out, in the middle of some string of incoherent mumbling that she couldn’t even begin to interpret.  He was now slumped forward in his chair, his head and one bent arm on the table, the other hanging limply down towards the floor.  Shelley sat, barely moving, watching him.  He had been like this for over half an hour.  She didn’t know exactly what would happen, or what it would look like, and she didn’t want to miss anything.
It took another hour.  By that point, it was getting very late, almost 1:00 a.m., and Shelley, in spite of her excitement, was having trouble staying awake.  She kept closing her eyes, for just a moment, and then having difficulty opening them again.  She was at the point where she thought she would have to make a cup of coffee to keep herself awake, and then James was gone.  He had not moved, and there had been no change in his rough breathing as he lay with the side of his face pressed against the table.  He was simply there one moment, and gone the next.
Shelley blinked, not quite sure if she had fallen asleep herself, and then stood up quickly.  She took a cautious step towards the chair where James had been just a second prior.  She called out softly, “James?” and then slowly reached forward to put her hand and arm in the space that he had so recently occupied.  Nothing.  No resistance, no anything.
She probed her hand around in the area for a moment, and then pulled it back quickly, a terrible thought entering her head.  What if he came back into that space while her arm was there?  She stood there, clutching her hands to her chest, and then realized that she was wasting time.  She had no idea how long she would have to do what she needed to do, and there would only be one chance to get this right.
Shelley quickly walked to the door that led from the kitchen to the side of the house, grabbing her car keys on the way.  She stepped outside, looking around to make sure no one was around.  The neighborhood was usually fairly quiet, but there was always a chance that someone would be out on a Friday night, even this late.  There was nothing moving.  The houses and parked cars stood silent under the occasional streetlamp.
She moved quickly around the corner of the house and to her car.  She unlocked it and retrieved the gloves, closing the car door as quietly as possible and moving back inside the house.  She started to close the kitchen door, and then stopped, realizing that it would make more sense if she left it ajar.  After that, she went into the bedroom to put her keys in her purse.
She put on the gloves and returned to the kitchen, where she retrieved the hammer from where James had put it on the counter.  Her eyes kept being drawn to the empty chair.  How much longer did she have?  A minute?  Two?  Ten?  “Stop it,” she muttered to herself.  She knew that she was wasting time, no matter how much of it was left.  Taking the hammer, she went into Brandon’s room.
* * * * * *
Things went how she had hoped.
* * * * * *
Three months later, it was a warm April morning, and Shelley was sitting on the front step of the house.  She was wearing new jeans and a linen shirt, holding a cup of coffee.  There had been an outpouring of support following the tragedy, both emotional and financial, from everyone she knew.  It had been increasingly difficult for Shelley to maintain the outward appearance of a shattered woman while, internally, her jubilance and sense of accomplishment were filling her to the point of overflowing.
She looked out at the street, trying to focus on looking broken and introspective.  It was easier now than it had been initially, because she had been feeling an increasing paranoia over the last few weeks.  Shelley knew that this was irrational.  If anything was going to go wrong, it very likely would have happened much earlier.  Still, it was almost as if things had gone too well.  Thinking back, there had been no hiccups at all.  She had laid out the steps she would have to take, she had taken them, and the expected outcome had been reached.
After she had left Brandon’s room, she had returned to the kitchen to find that James was still gone.  She placed the hammer on the far side of the table, where she knew that it wouldn’t intersect with him when he reappeared.  After that, she went into the bedroom, changed into her sleeping clothes, and crawled into bed.  She spent some time wriggling around to make sure that it would be obvious to anyone looking that someone had been sleeping in there.
After that, she got up and walked into the kitchen, where she was happy to see that James was back, exactly as he had been before he had vanished.  He was leaning forward on the table, his head on its side and his one arm bent.  If she hadn’t been there to see what had happened, she never would have known that he was gone.  She looked at the clock on the wall.  His entire vacancy had lasted about seven minutes.
She sat down across from him and did some brief calculating.  It would probably take about four minutes to walk back from Tim’s house.  Maybe another two for the business with Brandon.  Then some time for James to have a drink and pass out, and then time for her to wake up and discover everything.  At this point she had stopped, realizing that she was likely being foolish.  Linda would have probably seen everything and was likely already on the phone with the police.
Shelley sat for a few minutes, regardless, looking at James as he slept what would likely be the last pleasant sleep of his life.  After a few minutes, she heard the distant sound of sirens.  She stood up, walked over to the phone, and picked up the receiver.  Before dialing, she rapidly inhaled and exhaled several times, intentionally hyperventilating herself.  She then dialed 911, and when the dispatcher picked up, Shelly began to scream.
She sipped her coffee and looked out over the neighborhood in the early April sun.  Phillips had been the one that she eventually told everything to, wrapped in a blanket at the police station on a couch in an interview room.  There had been no shortage of officers helping her and offering coffee, blankets, or other comforts.  Everyone wanted to make things as easy as possible for the poor woman.  The poor woman that had experienced such a horrible, violent night.
It had been easy to tell Phillips what happened, because so much of her story was the actual truth.  While James had been in Vietnam, she had slept with Tim Matheson.  She was lonely and scared, and he had been a shoulder to cry on.  Luck was against them, though, and nine months later, Brandon was born.  James returned from the war shortly after, but never was suspicious.  He had been back home briefly before she and Tim had done their deed, and it was plausible enough that James was actually the father.
James had started to drink heavily in the years after, and then he began acting strangely.  Here, she started to blend some fiction into her accounting.  It eventually came out about her and Tim, and James’ drinking had worsened.  He was angry all of the time, and Shelley was scared.  James would threaten to hurt Tim, to hurt Shelley.  To hurt Brandon.  These threats were always made in their home, after he had been drinking, and she was too frightened to tell anyone.  They had stopped hiring Tim as a handyman, because Shelley was scared that James would try to do something.  She knew that Linda would be able to confirm part of this story, as Tim hadn’t been over to their house in over a year.
On the night of the murders, James had been drinking and angry.  Brandon was sick, so Shelley had stayed with him to help him get to sleep.  James had finally left the house.  Shelley figured he was going to some bar, so she had gone to sleep, emotionally and physically exhausted from the day.  She had managed to work up a good cry at this point as she told Phillips that she didn’t know it would be the last time that she would see her son alive.
She had woken some time later to a banging noise.  She figured that it was just James getting back in, and she tried to go back to sleep.  After a while, she realized that she was too scared to sleep, so she got up and went out into the kitchen, where she found James passed out with a bloody hammer near him.  She raced into Brandon’s room to find him dead, the blankets pulled up over his head, his skull caved in.  She couldn’t remember what happened after that, but didn’t express surprise when Phillips told her that she had managed to call 911, even though she was in a state of hysteria.  He had also told her that she was lucky James had stopped with the boy, and hadn’t continued on into her bedroom while she was asleep.
Everything else had lined up perfectly.  Linda had told the police that she had woken up to a struggle in the bedroom.  Someone had apparently broken in and was fighting with Tim.  She turned the lights on and recognized James.  He had eventually forced Tim down and kicked him repeatedly in the head.  The coroner’s investigation would later determine that Tim’s parietal bone had been shattered, destroying the whole left side of his brain.  James had then calmly walked out, oblivious to Linda’s screaming.  She had run out after him a minute later and he had been gone.  Shelley had gotten lucky, because Linda had opened the front door to try to see where James had went before she called the police.  There was no locked door to cast confusion on how James had gotten into the house.
The hammer was devoid of fingerprints except for Tim’s and James’.  The police concluded that he must have taken it from the pile of tools in Tim’s driveway before walking home and murdering the boy.  James himself had still been blacked out drunk when the police arrived, but had sobered up a little by the time they interrogated him.  He didn’t remember anything, and was just drunk enough to be impressionable and untrustworthy while being sober enough that he wouldn’t have been incapable of committing them.
Things had taken their proper course after that.  There was more evidence this time than there was for the prior two incidents, and there was no great distance to account for.  James hadn’t traveled to Phoenix or Cheyenne.  He had only been a few blocks over, in the same neighborhood.
Now, three months later, Shelley was enjoying her coffee and thinking of what she would do next.  She’d have to stay in town for a few more months for the trial, but no one would blame her for leaving after that.  Too many bad memories in Monterey.  She was thinking about heading south, to one of the suburbs around Los Angeles.  Someplace where she could start over.  Someplace fun.
And still, there was that small nagging sense of paranoia.  The feeling that she had forgotten some detail that would cause her trouble in the future.  She frowned and took another sip of coffee, realizing that it was getting cold.  She told herself that she was being stupid.  All she would have to do is keep things up for a little longer, and then she’d be free.  After all, the hard part was done already.
Her concern briefly mollified, she stood up and poured the last of the coffee out onto the lawn.  She turned around and went into the house, the whole day stretching in front of her.  As she closed the door behind her, she thought that she might drive up to San Francisco and spend the day at the shops and restaurants.  No one up there knew her, and she needed to be able to be herself for a little while.  All of this acting was wearing her down.
Five minutes later, Shelley was inside of the house, packing a day bag, when a beige Ford sedan pulled up.  It did not park down the street this time; it stopped directly in front of the house.  The man sitting in the driver’s seat was in his thirties, wearing plain, nondescript clothing.  A man that you might not notice in a gathering, even if he didn’t especially belong there.  On the seat next to him was a plain Manila envelope.  Inside of this envelope was a packet of information on James Hartford.  The first page was a notification to the reader that all material contained inside was considered classified and confidential.
Among the following reports and documents were a series of photographs taken on this very street, several months ago.  The first showed Shelley Hartford looking out the side door of her house in the early morning.  The second was of her walking to her parked car.  The third had her returning to the house, carrying a pair of gloves.
The man in the car glanced at the packet.  He wasn’t one to indulge in reminiscence, but there was a sense of impending closure in his mind.  After all, he had followed this situation for over eight years.  He couldn’t help but feel some small sense of failure at yet another project participant that hadn’t been able to reintegrate into civilized life, even without the… complicating factors that had arisen.  After all, domestic application was the real goal of the project.  Stable domestic application, that was.
The man reached into his jacket and flipped off the safety of his Beretta 92.  He got out of the car, sighed briefly, and then walked up to Shelley’s door."	9.46	13.0	Erik Peabody	04/29/2020
The Room	"A man awoke to find himself laying on the floor.  Dazed and confused he was somewhat relieved to see that he was not alone. At least a dozen more people were waking up as well; women, men a few children, including a little girl perhaps seven. She must have woken before everyone else because she was already standing.
The man got to his feet and helped others to theirs.
“Thank you, sir,” an elderly woman said with a toothless smile.
While holding her hand, the natural instinct to introduce one’s self, rose in him, but as he opened his mouth to speak, he realized he did not know who he was.
Listening to the chatter around him it became clear that no one knew their own name.  That by itself was unnerving, but what sent a chill up the man’s spine was realizing that they were all in a square room, pale white walls not much bigger than an office lobby or waiting room. And the room seemed to have no windows, and no doors.
Confusion moved like an infection from face to face as the realization that they were all sealed in and spread around the room. Some started looking for a way out, exploring the walls and the corners, the youngsters began to cry, and a few others tried to take charge, giving orders. One looked to be a priest. No one really listened.
Then suddenly, the room was plunged into darkness, pitch black, cold. There was a moment of deafening quiet. No one moved. The silence was shattered by a bone-chilling scream. The lights came one with a blinding suddenness. Looking around, the man noticed that the elderly woman he had helped up was gone. And in her place, blood pooled in thick circles.
Terror moved through the room, like an unencumbered wind. People began to shout and claw at the walls. A moment later, the lights went out again. A scream, deep, shrill, boomed in the darkness. The lights snapped back, bright and unforgiving. The man looked to his right where a young boy had stood moments ago. Now there was only blood.
Several people began to sob. People moved to the walls, looking for some kind of protection from the thing in the darkness. A moment later the light was gone. A high-pitched scream echoed in the blackness. When the lights returned a woman, who had been pressed up against the wall was gone. The blood on the floor showed a partial outline of where her bare foot had been.
The man did his best to control his fear. Difficult to do in a room filled with dread. But one other figure was as calm as he wanted to be. The little girl he had noticed earlier stood in the middle of the room, no panic, no fear, and she didn’t seem interested in finding a way out. She was different in another way as well. Her skin was olive-colored, Mediterranean if he had to guess. A stark contrast to everyone else in the room, who were all black. Everyone but him. He looked at his hands pale, sweat matting the blonde hair on his arms. When he looked back over at the girl, she greeted him with an unnerving smile.
She stepped close to a trembling boy not much older than her.
The lights went out.
The child screamed. When the lights returned, he was gone.
Shuddering, the man met the little girl’s gaze. Her smile persisted, joyful and unafraid.
She stepped toward a woman huddled in a corner. The lights vanished, and when they returned the corner was empty.
“It’s her,” a burly woman from the other side of the room shouted, an accusing finger thrust toward the little girl. “She is doing this. I saw her go to those that had disappeared right before they vanished.” The woman lunged at the girl. The girl did not move or attempt to defend herself. The woman grabbed her by the throat. “Why’re you doing this? Who are you?” The little girl smiled even as she choked.
The man grabbed the woman by the shoulder and wrenched her from the little girl. He pulled harder than he’d intended and the large woman tumbled to the floor. He felt horrible and reached out his hand hoping she would take it, but before she could, the lights were gone.
There was a bloodcurdling scream.
When he could see again, the man found himself holding out his hand to a puddle of blood. The woman was gone.
Besides him and the little girl, six others remained in the crimson spotted room; elderly, young, middle age. There was no age discrimination in this room. No immunity. One after the other the olive-skinned girl stepped toward them, the lights went out, there was a cry of pain, and then they were gone.
When only the man remained, he backed away from the little girl, pressing himself against the wall. The girl smiled and took a measured step his way.
“Please don’t,” he said.
She took another step.
“You don’t have to do this.”
She took a final step and stood at his feet. She smiled. Then the lights were gone.
He screamed.
The man sat up so fast he nearly fell from his cot. Sweat covered his brow, and he felt weak, dizzy, ready to pass out.  As he slumped back down into the soiled sheets the memory of where he was and who he was flooded back.
“Dr. Folsom,” came a voice from his right. A woman wearing a surgical mask, and a CDC issued faded-blue safe suit, minus the headgear, and stepped over to his cot. She knelt down on one knee. Her mask, discolored by moisture, covered most of her face but he recognized here dark brown eyes and thick Liberian accent. Jernora was her name, a volunteer from Sierra Leone. “You’re still with us.”
He tried to speak, but his throat was unimaginable dry and felt as if he’d swallowed razors. He glanced around the tent, and at the other cots. There were twenty or more, each occupied with death, a sheet drawn over the bodies.
“We moved you to this quarantine tent four days ago. I’m sorry I did not come by. I was told everyone in here was dead.”
He remembered being moved here. He remembered thinking that it was a death sentence and judging by his current company he wasn’t wrong.
“How are you feeling?”
How was he feeling? Over the past few weeks, he had watched the epidemic move like wildfire from village to village. He watched helplessly as dying mothers held their dead children. Medical school had given him the knowledge of how Ebola killed but seeing it for himself told him just how in inadequate words in a textbook are. How do you describe how it feels when your organs liquefy? How am I feeling? He felt like going back in time and listening to his father when he begged him not to come to West Africa.  “Let others risk their lives,” he had pleaded. He wished he’d stayed home and married Carrie, bought that overpriced house in Cardiff and raised a family. How was he feeling? He felt a lot of things, none of which mattered anymore.
He tried to move his hand to gesture to the room.
Jernora seemed to understand what he meant. “We haven’t moved the bodies, I know.” She shook her head, eyes full of water. “There was simply no one to do it. Everyone has been focused on the living. There’s no time for the dead.”
Folsom nodded or at least thought he did. He’d seen death move through a square tent like this. Inside its pale canvass walls, it touched each patient one after the other, systematically, as if there was an order to it. A schedule, even. Showing no prejudice or favoritism. The square tent was not unlike…And then he remembered. The deathbed hallucination. The room. The dying. The girl.
Jernora checked his vitals. Through her gloves, he could feel her shaking. Fatigue or exhaustion might have caused the trembling, but Folsom didn’t think that was it. He wanted to tell her it was okay. But something caught his attention in the back of the tent. Movement. Steady movement.
Jernora must have seen something in his face. “Dr. Folson, are you alright?” Her hands moved to his chest.
He summoned his strength, and with quivering hands, he tried to push her away. “Go,” he said.
“What is it?”
Folsom froze as a tiny figure moved in his direction. It walked past the dead with purpose. He tried again. Put the palm of his hands on Jernora’s shoulders and pushed. “Leave! Now.”
Jernora slowly got to her feet. “I let you rest. I check you later.”
He shook his head, locking his gaze on the girl with the olive skin. “Never return to this tent.”
She stood silently looking down, and Folson met her gaze seeing that look in her eye. The one that all the volunteers got when gazing down at someone’s final moments, the moment of complete irrational delusion. The delusion before dying. Folson had had that look a hundred times in the last few weeks, and each time he wondered what they must be going through, what images are conjured in those final moments.
“Go home, Jernora,” Folsom said. “Go home to those kids of yours and don’t look back.”
He watched as she turned and headed for the exit. When she left, she wiped her eyes, but she did as he had asked. She did not look back.
A wave of relief came over him, and he looked over at the little girl standing next to his cot. In this light, she looked a little different than she had in the room of the terrified and dying. Had the ebony wings protruding from her back always been there, he wondered.
The black feathers fluttered as she smiled. She stepped closer.
His mouth was dry and painful, but he managed to say, “I think I’m ready.”
She brought a hand over his chest, leaned down and said, “I know.”
Then the light was gone."	9.27	11.0	Kevin David Anderson	04/27/2020
Tapdance	"From the moment she learned to walk, little Myrtle dreamed of becoming a tap dancer.
She would totter through the house, her chubby bare feet slapping arrhythmically on the hardwood, her squeaky voice calling out “Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!” like tap shoes on a stage. When her second-grade teacher presented her with an oversized pair of old, black taps, Myrtle’s big eyes had sparkled and her pink lips had rounded in an awestruck “Ooooohh!”
Her mother, Esme, hated the tapping. She was prone to headaches, and the constant tap-tappa-tap ringing through the house was like a long, dull nail hammering into the center of her forehead, every tap driving it deeper.
“Please, sweetie,” she would beg, “not so loud. Mommy’s head hurts so much.”
But Myrtle would shake her head. “If I can’t tap, I’ll die,” she’d say, and the house would resound with the tap-tap-tap-TAP.
Myrtle tapped down the stairs to breakfast. She tapped up the sidewalk to school. She tapped in the house, in grocery store aisles, under the table at dinner. She tapped until her shoes were half-rotted and her pink toes wriggled from holes in the leather.
Esme took fistfuls of pills to drown the pain in her head, plugged her ears, and covered her face with pillows at night.
“Please, Myrtle, just an hour’s silence, just a moment’s.”
“No! I want to dance forever!”
Nothing could stop it, the endless, inescapable tap-tappa-TAP, tap-tappa-TAP, each tap driving the nail of pain deeper into Esme’s skull, each tap fueling a desperate, consuming desire for silence.
One cold, winter’s day, Esme lay in bed, her curtains drawn, a cold, wet rag draped over her forehead. The throbbing pain had just begun to subside, and she was drifting into sleep.
Then, a bang as the downstairs door flew open, followed by tap-tappa-TAP, tap-tappa-TAP.
Esme’s bloodshot eyes snapped open. The pain erupted anew, like glass marbles exploding inside her brain. A wave of despair crashed over her, but there was something else–something new burning inside her. The nail, driving deeper into her skull for three long years, had hit something.
She flew down the stairs and yelled in a terrible, trembling voice, “There will be no more tapping in this house!”
Myrtle, her yellow backpack slung over her shoulder, stood gaping wide-eyed at this crazed woman with wild hair, smeared lipstick, and furious red eyes.
“…Mommy?” she whispered.
“No more!” Esme shouted. “Do you hear me? No more!”
She dashed toward her. Myrtle screamed and turned to run. Esme caught her ankles and yanked them back, slamming little Myrtle onto the floor.
Esme clawed at the tap shoes, pulling at the cracked leather, her fingernails slashing at Myrtle’s calves.
“Mommy, stop!” Myrtle cried, “Mommy, please!”
“No more!” Esme shouted as she tore the tap shoes from Myrtle’s feet. She reached back with a savage cry and threw them into the fireplace.
“Nooo!” Myrtle dove to save her beloved shoes. But the fire was too hot, and she could only watch as they burned.
Esme laughed, a wild cackling laugh like the fire itself. “No more!” she yelled gleefully. “No more tapping! No more!”
Myrtle stood perfectly still, watching the leather shrivel and crack in the flames. Suddenly, she threw her head back and howled, a cry of despair and agony so awful that it silenced her mother.
The vicious expression on Esme’s face vanished. She blinked, as if waking from a dream. “I…I…” she stammered. She gasped at the fire, as though seeing it for the first time. “Did I just…? How could I…?”
Myrtle bolted out of the house, sobbing.
Esme chased after her. “Sweetie, wait!”
Myrtle ran barefoot across the snow-covered front yard, her cries echoing through the neighborhood. She ran toward the street, her arms flailing, her eyes blinded with tears.
She never saw the truck.
“Myrtle!” Esme cried.
There was a screech of tires. A red mist sprayed into the air, and a sickening wet snap rang out like a tree branch breaking under the weight of snow.
Esme’s run slowed to an unsteady walk. Numb, with a dull ringing in her ears, she approached the spot where the bright red tire track cut a line through the snow. She couldn’t hear the people who got out of the car, one yelling uncontrollably, the other begging for an ambulance on the phone. The only thing she could hear was the gurgling sound coming from her daughter’s top half, thrown far from where her legs had landed, a bloody foam oozing from her mouth, pink bubbles popping on her lips and sounding almost like taps.
Esme fell to her knees and screamed.
* * * * * *
Esme sat beside the grave, clutching and releasing the soft black earth in her hand.
Fat, clumpy snowflakes were beginning to fall. She watched them land and melt on the back of her hand, watched them collect on the gravesite. The only sound was the gentle crunch of the soil in her fingers as she squeezed and released, squeezed and released, rhythmically, like a heartbeat.
Soon the snowfall would cover the soil, she thought, erasing it from the landscape in a blanket of white. Grass would grow over it in the spring. In a thousand years, even the gravestone would be reduced to a lump of shapeless rock. Nothing would remain.
Nothing, she knew, but the pain she felt, the infinite agony. She knew even time itself would never erase such a thing, that when her body died she would simply be formless, thoughtless pain for all eternity.
She lay down on top of the grave, closed her eyes, and let the snow fall on them both.
She pictured Myrtle beneath the ground, wearing the pretty yellow dress that she wore to her dance recitals. She pictured her dancing on stage, but she couldn’t keep her whole in her mind. The little girl kept coming apart into two pieces, torso and legs. The legs danced, while the top half glared at her in anguish and rage.
Esme laid on her side in the winter stillness. Her body was gripped by a suffocating pain that made her want to curl into herself and vanish, pain that reached into every part of herself.
Every part but her head.
In the silence, her head was tranquil and clear. The pounding headaches had ceased, and in their place, there was now a secret, shameful relief.
She ran her fingers over the grave, tracing lines in the fluffy snow. Perhaps, she thought, she could at least be grateful for this one small silver lining, this one tiny piece of solace in her grief. Myrtle would understand, wouldn’t she?
She closed her eyes and let the slightest smile came to her lips.
Suddenly, she sat up.
She had touched something. What was it?
She brushed snow away from the ground and gasped.
There, at the base of the gravestone, were two shiny yellow tap shoes.
* * * * * *
Esme lay in bed, her face smeared with hot, sticky tears. Her breath was short and shallow. Her tremoring hands clutched fistfuls of blanket under her chin.
“I’m sorry,” she whispered over and over. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m–”
Her head shot up. She held her breath. Had she heard something? Blood pounded in her ears as she strained to listen.
After a long minute, she exhaled and fell back onto the bed.
She sat bolt upright. No, it wasn’t just imagination. She could hear a faint tap-tappa-tap, tap-tappa-tap coming from outside.
She cast off the blanket and rushed downstairs. She threw open the front door and ran out into the yard, bare feet crunching in the snow.
“Myrtle?” she called. “Sweetie, is that you?”
She listened, but she heard only her own quivering breath and the sniffles in her nose.
She wrapped her arms around herself, shivering in her underwear as the snow fell onto her shoulders. She walked back into the house and closed the door behind her. She fell onto her hands and knees in front of the fireplace. Heaving sobs wracked her body.
TAP-TAP-TAP.
The sound rang out like gunfire. Esme gasped. “Myrtle?”
TAP-TAP-TAP…TAP-TAP-TAP. The sound was sharp and violent, seeming to come from within the walls themselves. It pounded like a war drum, rattling the whole house, knocking pictures from the mantle above the fireplace.
Esme clutched her head in her hands. The world was tilting, spinning around her. Darkness enveloped her in cold, airless folds. She could feel herself sliding away into madness.
TAP-TAP-TAP.
“I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m so sorry. The pain, my head–I couldn’t bear it! It was like a nail in my brain, the tapping. Always the tapping, the unending tapping. I thought if I could stop the tapping, just for moment, I could think.” She pounded her fists against her head and wailed. “Ohhh, but I would give anything, anything, to hear it again.”
The sounds ceased. Esme doubled over, clutching her gut as she sobbed in the darkness.
She swallowed her sobs and listened. She could hear something, a new sound.
Tap-tappa-tap-SCRAAPE, tap-tappa-tap-SCRAAPE.
This was not some mad hallucination. This was the sound of tap shoes, in this very room, and something scraping against the hardwood.
Esme wiped tears from her eyes. She peered into the darkness, her vision still blurry.
She saw her.
Little Myrtle, sitting on the floor, a dim square of moonlight falling on the shoulders of her yellow dress.
Esme could hardly breathe. “My baby,” she whispered. “My Myrtle.”
Esme crawled toward her, holding her arms out, a tight, wincing smile on her face.
She stopped.
Myrtle’s skin was blotchy and gray, with dark purple veins running up and down her arms. Her waist was a crimson tangle of bloody flesh, legless, with putrid black intestines and a glistening white spinal column hanging down. She stood on her hands, on which she wore the yellow tap shoes.
Esme, frozen, could only watch as the child dragged herself toward her, tap-tappa-tap-SCRAAPE, her spine dragging along the floor beneath her.
Myrtle leaned her rotting face close to her mother’s, her rancid eyeballs weeping black slime.
“We’re going to go dancing, mommy,” she said. “Forever.”
* * * * * *
Days later, the police were called to investigate a smell coming from the house. They found Esme dead in the front room. Her feet had been mangled and broken to fit into a pair of child-size tap shoes, and her hair had been burned off in the fireplace. But the official cause of death had been the dozens of long, dull nails hammered into her skull. According to investigators, the uniform placement of the nails indicated that they were not driven in haphazardly; rather, they were hammered in slowly, carefully, one tap at a time."	8.75	12.0	H.K.

Spacegirl	"We called her Spacegirl.
Her real name was Megan Daniels, but nobody actually called her that. She’d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and Coke bottle glasses. For as long as I’d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn’t like to be around us. She didn’t play with us when we were kids, she didn’t even talk much.
Most of the time, she’d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she’d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn’t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.
It all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.
It had been raining that day, so we’d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.
“I can’t believe they let that retard sit in with us,” Sasha murmured. “Look at her… Why do they even let them in schools? They aren’t gonna learn anything.”
“Better than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom,” said Tanya Everett. She and I weren’t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. “My Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.” None of us could actually say the dreaded S-word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.
Spacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she’d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.
“What? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?” She asked. The teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn’t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she’d been). She looked over to the teacher’s desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl.
“What are you even doing in there, retard?”
She’d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her.
“What even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?”
She handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly.
“Wow. You can’t even draw. Look at this?”
She tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she’d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirl’s desk.
“Draw something that isn’t trash next time,” Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean-spirited just for the sake of it.
Spacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn’t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.
After that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they’d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.
During the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirl’s shoulder.
“Wow, that’s really good, Spacegirl,” was how most of her comments would start, “Did you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?”
There was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.
“Can you draw me?” Sasha asked once. “I heard that retards were always, like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it’ll even look like a person!”
Spacegirl didn’t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won’t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren’t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.
It was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don’t know all the details, and I don’t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I’d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.
James had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn’t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world’s toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirl’s house. Naturally, there had been speculation that they’d been having sex. Someone told me that James’ parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.
We were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and was holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I’d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.
“Look! She wanted to give you a kiss!” one the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn’t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.
“You fucking faggot assholes!” James yelled as he picked himself up.
“Hey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!” laughed Brian. “Come on, give her a kiss!”
Someone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn’t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn’t see Spacegirl until January… we didn’t see James or his friends ever again.
On Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn’t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My parents told me that he’d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual… I’d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.
I went over to Sasha’s house on the day before New Years’. We’d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren’t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.
“Hey! Kept me waiting!” she said when I knocked on the door.
“Sorry.”
“It’s fine. I’ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!”
I didn’t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she’d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.
“You’re gonna love it,” she promised me. “It’s gonna be so funny…”
She led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk. “Where did you get this?” I asked, walking closer to it.
“Spacegirl dropped it when Brian and his brother pulled that prank the other day. She dropped it. I may have grabbed it… Y’know, just for safekeeping.”
She cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.
“Look at this… She’s been drawing the same damn unicorns forever. She didn’t even finish this one!”
She paused at one small picture that was labeled ‘The Unicorn Prince’. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.
“I figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I’d step up! What do you think?” Sasha wasn’t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.
In her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed. In the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth. In the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building.
Sasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.
“What do you think?” she asked with a grin, “I’ll bet she’ll lose her shit!”
I closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.
“A-are you out of your mind?” I asked. Sasha’s grin faded.
“What do you mean?”
“You stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that’s really messed up!”
“It’s Spacegirl. Who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?”
“You just… drew her killing herself over and over again!” I took the book off her desk. “Do you not understand what’s wrong with that?”
Sasha just stared at me like I was crazy.
“Fine. Sue me for trying to be funny,” Sasha said. “Just give it here…” She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her.
“No. You’re just going to put something else in there.”
Anger flared in Sasha’s eyes.
“Jane, just give me the book.”
“No!”
I opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirl’s suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but pushed her back. I didn’t mean to push so hard, but I did, and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide-eyed and shocked. I don’t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes… Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirl’s notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn’t let it go until I got home.
I spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha’s. I’d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I’d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she’d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she’d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn’t so sure.
I remember looking through Spacegirl’s drawings. The ones that she’d done. I remembered the ones I’d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through unicorns, fairies and castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha’s place, it had been blank, but at my house, it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards, with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?
I brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha’s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it.
On the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U-shaped indents that looked like they’d been made by hooves. A deer, perhaps? I didn’t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.
I wasn’t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her side-eying me. She didn’t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.
“Hey,” I said, “I’m… I hope you had a nice holiday.”
She didn’t respond.
“I’m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn’t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean-spirited.”
Still no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, and then back at me.
“Sasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn’t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there…” I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn’t seem angry or thankful. She didn’t seem anything at all. Just stoic.
“I’m sorry if I wasn’t all that great to you before,” I said, and then I shuffled off to my desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one.
It wasn’t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I’d done.
When Sasha got in, she didn’t talk to me. She didn’t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I’d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.
The teacher hadn’t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.
“What do you want?” she spat.
Now it was my turn to be silent.
“Fuck off and leave us alone,” Tanya said. “You’d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don’t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It’s a quarantine issue.”
I stared at both of them, and I could’ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt… What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn’t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she’d been writing on, and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.
I didn’t really have anyone left… So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn’t happy with? I’d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she’d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.
Your Words
There is a land where your sorry may go,
A sickening land where it always snows.
The snow is putrid in color and smell,
It’s substance filth and things I won’t tell.
Only your father has been there before,
One day your boyfriend will visit once more.
This place in your carcass, this humanoid hell,
Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell.
My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz,
Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.
This was unlike anything I’d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful… This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she’d thrown it out. It didn’t fit with everything else she’d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly… This was something she’d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn’t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I’d made her feel.
Eighth grade wasn’t fun for me.
I had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I’d punched her and stolen the book. Then I’d tried to kiss her, punched her when she’d refused, and then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day. I’d done the right thing.
By the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sasha’s rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd, at least.
Sasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn’t pay her any mind. Spacegirl barely changed at all. I didn’t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she’d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship… but it never felt right.
Sasha’s bullying never let up, of course. She stalked Spacegirl to the library where she’d pull the same old shit she’d been pulling since the fifth grade. She’d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it… but I didn’t always see it.
“Coming to her rescue again, huh, Jane?” Sasha asked once when I’d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open.
“What’s she ever done to you anyways?” I asked. “She’s just minding her own business.”
“Oh? What’s she done to you, dyke?” Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.
“Unicorns… unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns… When are you going to grow up, Spacegirl?”
“Hey! I told you to stop!” I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.
“Fine,” she said. “Tan, let’s leave the happy couple to their alone time.” She pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier.
Spacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.
I turned to leave her when I heard, “Thanks.”
I looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.
“Um… You’re welcome,” I said, “Let me know if she bothers you again, alright?”
“I will. But… you’re usually there anyways.”
Her voice was soft and low. I’d heard it before, but I don’t remember her ever speaking directly to me.
“Yeah, well. It’s just not right. She’s such a child. One of these days she’s going to have to grow up.”
Spacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again.
For a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but… No. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again.
In tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn’t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I’d ever seen.
I went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I’d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn’t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.
The woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the Coke bottle glasses.
“You must be Jane,” she said. She wasn’t smiling, but she didn’t sound upset either.
“Yes, ma’am…”
“Come on in. Megan’s upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.”
The house was warm, with plenty of knick-knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls, mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn’t waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirl’s room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in, though. I didn’t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.
Sure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she’d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn’t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing… But then I noticed her walls.
They weren’t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full-on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.
“Holy shit, are these yours?”
“They are,” Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.
“It… it’s soothing,” she said after a while. “Painting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and… I finish them.”
She spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.
“We should get started,” she said. “Sorry…”
“No, it’s alright!” I said. I sat in the chair for her. “I’d like to hear about it.”
Spacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw… Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she’d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she’d always liked fantasy, and how she liked unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could’ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.
The portrait she’d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful… but this made me look transcendent. I wasn’t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost Disney-esque.
“I love it,” I told her, “That’s incredible Spa… Megan… That’s really great!”
“You can call me Spacegirl if you want,” she said. “I don’t mind the nickname… Not as much as I mind the people, at least.”
My awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn’t look upset… She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No… not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there.
“I wish… I wish I’d been nicer to you, when we were younger,” I said.
“Is that why you’re here right now?” Spacegirl asked.
“No! I… I’m here for the assignment. I mean… the art assignment. The portraits…”
She continued to stare.
“Did you pick me because you felt bad for me?” she asked.
“No! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.”
Spacegirl didn’t react for a moment, but then she just nodded.
“Okay.” Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait.
“Mom can drive you home if you need a ride,” she said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn’t know what to say. Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?
“Alright. Thanks.” It was the only thing I could think of. “See you tomorrow.”
With that, I left her.
I was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art… and when I did, I wasn’t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late… but what she’d brought in stole my breath away.
It was my portrait, but she’d done more with it than I thought possible. She’d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide-eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single-handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course, I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I’d ever seen.
My portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I’d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.
“Where’s your flower crown, dyke?” Sasha said.
“Leave me alone,” I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.
“I always knew you were a little dyke. But now you’ve posted solid proof of it! We’ve gone and cracked the case, haven’t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!”
I tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.
“What’s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you, dyke?” she snapped at me.
“Maybe she only fucks retarded girls,” Tanya said. “I’ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.”
I stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don’t know what it was about what she’d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I’m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn’t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.
Naturally, I got a three-day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they’d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit-eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I’d seen last time I’d laid a hand on her… and something about it scared me.
When I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they’d taken it down because I’d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.
“Someone took it,” Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.
“When?”
“The day after you hit Sasha… I don’t think anyone’s found it yet.”
She didn’t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn’t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn’t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn’t put it past her. In the end, it didn’t matter.
By the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.
The words ‘Retard Fucking Dyke’ had been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn’t know what to say or do… But this felt like too much.
The picture was taken down quickly… but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn’t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I’d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she’d been crying.
“I’m sorry about the painting…” I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.
“I knew she’d do something like that…” she said. “I’m so used to it by now, that it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.”
“But you worked hard on that,” I said. “I’d be upset, too.”
She just shook her head.
“That’s not it,” she said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me.
Slowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.
It wasn’t the same drawing… but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read ‘Retard Dyke Wedding’.
“There were so many in my locker…” Spacegirl said.
“This is what she drew in your notebook… when I returned it to you… This is what I had to take out.”
Spacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn’t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I’d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it, though… When I looked back at her notebook, the unicorn wasn’t there anymore. She must have just erased it… but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn’t been erased at all.
Tanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn’t know what she had in mind, but I didn’t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.
“What do you want?” I asked.
“It’s a surprise,” she said. “Sasha and I just want you to know how much we love dykes in this town… Oops, I’ve said too much.”
I wanted to hit her. Dear God, I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind… it wasn’t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I’d do.
“Come on, dyke. Go home,” she said. “Let’s go check out your surprise.”
In a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn’t outrun her… I couldn’t fight her off. I didn’t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn’t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.
Tanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.
“Hey, Jane,” she said. “How’s it going?”
“What the fuck is this?!”
“Just wanted to chat,” Sasha said with a cold chuckle. “You think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You’ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you’re fucking choosing, right? Right? God… I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you’re better than me just because you feel bad for her.”
“You’re crazy.”
Sasha just laughed.
“I’m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You’re absolutely fucking psycho!”
On the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.
“You wanna be a dyke? I don’t care. But I’m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!”
Sasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us. “What the hell?” Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it… that was another story entirely.
Standing on the path behind us was a unicorn… but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but… that was impossible… It had to be impossible. Neatly done gray lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!
Tanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide-eyed as she stared at the advancing unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for her. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn’t outrun the paper unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya’s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.
Tanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.
Sasha and I stared in silent horror as the unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya’s body. She didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.
Sasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha’s leg tightly.
Still with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her painting, and she took Sasha’s leg with her.
“FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!”
Sasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn’t overpower it. She couldn’t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.
“JANE! JANE, HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!”
The hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper unicorn. The unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods, and then I was alone.
Slowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed, and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning.
They chalked Tanya’s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don’t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.
High School was ten years ago, though, and I’ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I’ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don’t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn’t like to talk about it and I won’t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different… but I don’t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn’t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack, either, but to my knowledge, there’s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl."	9.17	23.0	Ryan Peacock	04/25/2020
Creepypasta is Dead	"Creepypasta is dead.
Its corpse is filled with parasites.
There was a brief, wonderful window of time in the early 2010s where everything was perfect. Slenderman was still scary. Candle Cove could have been a real show. Jeff the Killer was… well, let’s just say his flaws hadn’t been fully explored just yet.
A closed community of readers and writers frequented a small selection of websites – mostly 4chan – and shared anonymous tales of terror. Then, it got popular. YouTube got a hold of it, and soon hordes of new authors were trying to get noticed by minor celebrities like UnclePasta, DaPastaCreep, and whoever else was lucky enough to snag a memorable channel name.
Where talent failed, clickbait reigned supreme. Creepypasta became less about trying to convince people your story was true, and more about fitting into a “Top 10 True Vampire Encounters” video. The plot quickly became less important than thinking of a catchy title.
The fandom grew and mutated, as fandoms tend to do. It’s just the nature of fame. Monsters and serial killers were turned into eligible bachelors and bachelorettes, shipped and re-shipped with each other in risqué fanfic.
Hollywood took notice and tried to exploit the audience for a cash grab. TV shows and movies were spat out with little to no regard for their source material. Watered-down nightmare fuel. White-washed cursed images. The shadows that stalked the night became shadows of their former selves.
Even the SCP Foundation and NoSleep are now showing the same signs of degradation that will eventually lead them into obscurity. Give it time.
Throughout it all, through the rise and the fall of a niche art form, there was Macabaroni.com – a somewhat clever combination of “Macabre” and “Macaroni”. In other words, creepy pasta.
Launched in 2008, Macabaroni was a labor of love. It was created as a repository for anonymous horror stories that would otherwise be lost forever to the depths of imageboard history. The creator, ScareWare, reposted stories he found across the web, and accepted the occasional submitted work if it met his quality standards.
A few years ago, after more than a decade of operation, the website was sold at auction. There was no warning. No announcement. One day, it was safe in the hands of a long-time community member… the next, it was purchased by a small Silicon Valley media company that specialized in fan sites for popular television shows.
People who knew the owner were just as shocked as the rest of us. There was talk about ScareWare saying the site was “hard to keep control of” before the sale, but other than that, no one actually expected him to step down. It was even more confusing when he disappeared from the internet completely.
For about a year, the previously indispensable resource for all things creepypasta languished under the control of a company that didn’t understand it. They tried to polish up the site’s image and make it friendlier to casual visitors. In all fairness, they were just trying to cater to a more diverse and expanding fan base.
Unfortunately, small companies have to turn a profit. When Macabaroni.com failed to bring in said profit, they immediately put it back up for sale. Again, without warning and without a single word to the readers. You know, looking back at it… I wonder how many authors even heard that their stories were being sold for-profit along with the site.
The newest buyer was Liam Schilling. He was a random entrepreneur that had amassed personal wealth by selling work-at-home eBooks and get-rich-quick video seminars. The things that bored soccer moms waste their money on and never actually learn from. Somewhere along the line, he got the idea to invest in web development. One of his business contacts probably told him that ad parking and domain name speculation were the next hot trends in virtual real estate. That bubble had burst years ago, much like creepypasta itself.
Regardless, Liam was the proud owner of Macabaroni.com, for the small fee of one hundred thousand dollars. I guess he could afford to overpay.
This is where I come in.
I’m not a skilled author. Obviously. I just enjoyed the spooky stories I read, and tried to emulate that to create my own content. I started by hacking out clumsy revenge fantasies, and then moved on to gory monster stuff. Wendigos, mostly. Nowadays, you’re likely to find me writing psychological, slow-burn plot lines. Twelve-part story threads, and the like.
I was one of many, many authors who had submitted written work to the site. I guess Liam made his way down the list of emails, asking random people if they would be interested in volunteering to help review and green-light submissions.
I was enticed by the chance to help new writers step into the spotlight. If they weren’t quite ready yet, I could offer them critiques that might help them grow. The creepypasta community was dying, but in one small corner of the internet, I could try to keep part of it alive.
I quickly agreed to help with the site, and Liam answered back immediately. Much to my own surprise, I was given the “keys to the kingdom” with little to no questions asked. At the time, I thought he trusted me because of the quality of the stories I had sent in. In retrospect, he likely didn’t care enough about the content to bother finding out who I was. As long as he didn’t have to do the work, he was willing to take the risk.
Macabaroni was just another revenue stream to him, and any warm body would do in my position. To him, the site where I spent so many sleepless nights was no different from TopSportsBettingTips.net or KitchenBathroomCountertops.org. Both of which he also owned.
There were so many Skype calls… so many long, drawn-out monologues where he would tell me about how smart he was, and how many business opportunities he had lined up. All while I just nodded along, never able to get a word in.
One of Liam’s favorite phrases when it came to the site was “make it go away”. Problem with the WordPress theme? Make it go away. Random DDoS attack on the site? Make it go away. Authors coming around and asking for us to pay them a cut of ad revenue? Make it go away.
I convinced myself that no matter how much Mr. Schilling disrespected the site, I would be there to guard the stories I loved. I would make sure a new generation of fans could experience all of that fear in unapologetic, hyper-realistic detail.
Across the next year, I did my best to ignore the warning signs. At first, it was easy to assume Liam was just making mistakes because he was new to creepypasta and didn’t know anything about it. I figured that he would do his research and come to understand that he bought something very important to a lot of people.
Eventually, I understood that he had no interest whatsoever in becoming a part of our community.
Stories were going missing. I don’t know how many times it happened before I noticed. When one of my favorite classics, “The Cackleman”, disappeared overnight, I contacted Liam to report what I assumed was a database glitch.
I already expected his usual response. He would just tell me to get rid of the problem, even though I had only agreed to review submissions. How did he get me to handle every facet of the site’s operation? I guess you only get to be a rich scumbag by being very good at manipulating people.
I was surprised when the reply to my email wasn’t his usual “make it go away” catchphrase.
Apparently, Liam’s girlfriend had sat down and looked at the site. I never really knew much about her, but he was living in Taiwan at the time and I always pictured her as a pretty, much-younger lady who probably regretted her life choices.
One thing I did find out about her was that she hated The Cackleman. Liam’s exact words were “gross” and “disturbing”. I tried to explain to him that the whole point of creepypasta was to be “disturbing”, and that “gross” was subjective. Regardless, he decided the story was offensive and had deleted it himself.
Deleted. Just like that. For all he knew, and he knew very little, that could’ve been the only preserved copy of the story. He was willing to just erase someone else’s work, something so many readers loved, with no forewarning… and he saw nothing wrong with it.
I watched in stunned silence as more stories vanished over the course of months. Mr. Shush. Bill the Bleeder. The Weird Case of Casey Weir.
He made them go away. The fact that he didn’t ask me to remove anything proved that he knew it was wrong. He knew I never would’ve agreed to do it, so he just hoped I wouldn’t notice.
At that rate, there would be no stories left. Horror is offensive. That’s kind of the point.
What’s worse, people were contacting me about the missing content. I had to walk a tightrope of explaining why exactly the stories were gone without making Liam look bad. A gnawing, cold feeling in my stomach told me that if he felt everyone was pissed off at him, he might actually throw a tantrum and torch the entire website out of a petty need for revenge.
He outright owned one of the largest archives of our shared history, and the website traffic would be just as valuable to him with a parked advertising page. Maybe it would make even more money without stories getting in the way of the ads.
Eventually, I couldn’t stand the random deletions any longer. Being used, being unappreciated, that was my own fault for letting it happen. However, watching Liam Schilling throw away great pastas like an infant pushing a plate of spaghetti off his high chair was breaking me.
I waited for our weekly Skype call to give him the news. I was going to quit, effective immediately, with absolutely no notice since no one else seemed to be giving any.
It was the dead of night in his part of the world, so he’d have to sleep on what I was about to say.
I let him drone on and on about himself, as per usual. He talked about his vast intelligence and his keen business sense. He mentioned the business deals he was working on, and how much money he would make. I guess he expected me to be jealous or to admire him. Instead, I just interrupted him once in a while with sarcastic comments.
“Cool!” I cheered. I may have even thrown in an “Awesome!” or two.
I think I went a bit too far when I shouted, “Wow, bro, that sounds epic!” But he didn’t seem to notice.
I guess he thought I was genuinely impressed. No surprise there. He probably spent the majority of his time surrounded by a corporate cult of yes-men who bought all of his self-serving double-talk.
Finally, the hour-long speech was drawing to a close. It was time to tear him down with my own diatribe on how much of a disappointment he had been. I was ready to list every one of his failings, and to let him know I would use his own story submission form to directly contact anyone who volunteered for him in the future. He’d have to run the site himself, or not at all.
Before I got the chance to speak, the sound of a sharp knock came from his side of the call. It sounded a bit distant, and if I had to guess, I would say it was coming from the front door of the house.
“Hang on, that’s probably Akemi,” Liam snorted as he hauled his pale, doughy form up from his desk chair and left the room. He had been wearing boxer shorts the entire time.
Well, at least I finally knew the name of the girlfriend. Something that was never important enough to him to mention.
I sat there, holding my tongue once again. After everything that had built up to that moment, I was left with self-righteous blue-balls. Typical.
Liam entered the room again onscreen. More accurately, he burst in. He looked panicked. Horrified. He closed the door behind him and, after a moment of flustered inaction, he propped a chair against the doorknob.
“What’s wrong? What’s going on?” I asked. Seeing that look of fear on a human being’s face, even one as punchable as his, made me forget all of my hatred.
“Shut up! Stop making noise!” Liam whispered angrily. I saw his hand move to the side of his computer, and figured he must have turned the volume to zero.
I watched as Liam took his cell phone in shaking hands and dialed a number I couldn’t see. He said something in another language. Mandarin, I would assume.
All the while, a slow, steady banging could be heard in the background. Someone was repeatedly striking a door. Hard. As Liam stumbled over his words, I heard the sound of that far-off door cracking under the weight of fists.
Within moments, the door to his home office was rattling from the blows of that same intruder. I could only look on as the door came off of its hinges and fell to the floor, knocking over the propped chair. Liam stared forward, toward the webcam, toward me. I’ll never erase his wide-eyed, vacant expression of dread from my mind.
In the darkness of the hallway behind him, I saw a human shape. I saw white, piercing eyes like flashlights, and a gleaming grin that looked more like a white void than teeth.
“The Cackleman”.
For a moment, I considered the idea that it was all a prank. It seemed too insane to be real. That moment didn’t last long, however.
I instinctively covered my mouth, as if screaming would make any difference at that point. The Cackleman stepped into the room, fluorescent lights doing nothing to illuminate his pitch-black body. He was a black hole of a person, save for those high-beam facial features. Just like in his story. The story Liam had deleted.
I heard the hollow, reverberating laughter of the Cackleman as my eyes focused and fixed on other figures behind him.
A human corpse, puppeted like a marionette by ropy tendrils of its own blood. Moving methodically as those red, congealed feelers sought out cracks and crevices to use for leverage. I’d recognize “Bill the Bleeder” even if there hadn’t been any fan art of him.
Then, torn black jeans and army boots. Fingerless gloves and military jacket. A sweatshirt hoodie with no face inside – just the tremendous, open mouth of a lamprey. It was “Mr. Shush”, the slasher icon popular with edgy teens.
Following behind, an unassuming young man in a bow-tie, sweater-vest, and coke bottle glasses. “Casey Weir”… for some reason, he always scared me the most. I guess the quiet ones are the worst.
Behind the foursome, I could see motion… more creatures and killers packed into the hallway. Other characters from other stories Liam unceremoniously deleted.
Remnants of discarded legends.
Ghosts of the stories he had killed.
Suddenly, Liam snapped back to reality. He turned in his chair, away from me and toward the things behind him. The things that were now pushing against each other and vying for position. Everyone wanted to be the first to get a piece of him, and no one wanted to be left out at the end.
“Make… it… go away…” he timidly whined.
If I still had any question about whether or not this was a joke, it would have been gone the moment Mr. Shush bit into Liam’s face. I just shook… shook, and stared… until a stray spatter of blood covered the webcam’s lens.
I could hear the screaming, then a pathetic gurgling, coming from my speakers long after the visuals were obscured. The inhuman, echoing laughter never stopped. If the story held true, any trace of Liam… if anything at all was left of him… would disappear into the endless abyss of the Cackleman’s body. Not a single scrap would be found.
Thus ended the cautionary tale of Liam Schilling. His demise was as uncanny and traumatic as any classic creepypasta, and I suppose there’s a bit of poetic justice somewhere in there. If he had bothered to read the stories he was hosting, he would’ve known not to meddle with such things.
Then again, maybe his story is just yet another silly revenge fantasy. A greedy, brutish slob is drawn and quartered while the person he wronged gets to watch. I don’t know. I didn’t feel vindicated. I only felt sick.
Needless to say, Macabaroni.com was sold yet again. I don’t know if one of Liam’s family members put it up for sale, or if was one of his business partners. Part of me believes the site is selling itself… a digital flytrap that lures in the cockroaches of the community. Maybe it’s killed before. No one has heard from the original owner in a couple of years now.
The weirdest thing about all of this, if you can believe anything is weirder than what I’ve told you already, is what happened to the stories.
I can’t find them.
No one can.
The Cackleman, Mr. Shush, Bill the Bleeder, The Weird Case of Casey Weir, and all the rest… they’re gone. Like, completely gone. It’s like everyone in the realm of internet horror is suffering from a shared case of the Mandela Effect.
These stories just do not exist on any platform, in any format. Not on 4Chan, SomethingAwful, or even Reddit. Even the Creepypasta Wiki doesn’t have it, and they’ll publish pretty much anything these days.
I think that the stories and characters I grew up with are gone forever. Worse yet, maybe they’re finally free.
The only thing I can think of that might fix both of those problems is if I, or someone like me, wrote and posted those stories again. Maybe fiction is just a cage in which we trap our demons.
I don’t know if anyone’s going to actually take the time to rewrite them, though.

Slow Clap	"I sat down on the padded stool. It was cushioned and made of black leather. As I lifted the sticks, I couldn’t help but shake the feeling like I was being watched. Like there was some sort of audience staring at me just outside of my field of vision. A chill ran down my spine, prompting a quick shudder as I tried to shake the feeling.
I took a quick glance around, reassuring myself that I was, in fact, alone. When I turned to face the snare drum between my thighs, I let out a long, deep exhale.
I started easy, playing a simple 4/4 beat. As I began to warm up, and my limbs loosened a bit, I started to throw in a few fills. Before I knew it, I was engulfed into a world of intricate paradiddles, heavy double and triple bass notes and lots of cymbals. It was my happy place.
The solo went on only for a minute or two, but during that time, I’d played some of the greatest beats I’d ever come up with. The ideas for transitions and different rolls came with each strike of the stick against the drum heads.
My setup wasn’t anything profound. It was quite simple, actually. I had a single bass drum, two tom-toms mounted atop. A floor tom sat to the right and a snare drum to the left, nestled between my legs. The hi-hat was just to the left of the snare, raised a bit higher than most people liked. It was comfortable, in my opinion.
The cymbals were my signature, though. A lot of people have differing opinions about cymbal use. Some are of the camp that a good drummer need not rely on their cymbals to make the songs, others believe that, if used correctly, the cymbals can actually provide a great accent to the drums themselves. I feel like I’ve found a balance.
I don’t have too many cymbals, but I have a decent variety. Two simple 16 and 18-inch crashes, a tinny-sounding 19-inch ride, the china makes for a great switch-up when you’ve overused the crash a bit and finally a bell chime, which works as a great accent to heavy, blast-beat laden metal songs.
As I finished up, rolling the cymbals out at the end of the set like some sort of Rock God, the sound slowly died down.
What came next froze me in place.
The sound of a slow, methodical clap emanated from one of the bedrooms on the far end of my house.
Ice filled my veins, the blood drained from my face and an immense sense of foreboding spread across my body, gripping me like a vice. My breathing echoed in my ears as the sound of slow clap after terrifying clap resonated throughout the tile-floored living room of my home.
I slowly rotated in my seat, maintaining an upright, distressed posture. My eyes darted around in my skull, but my head remained frozen in place, awaiting the horrific noise to cease.
Finally, it had stopped. Silence filled the air, but was not welcomed. Now, it was tainted with horror. Soaked in the thought that there was someone or something else in this house with me.
My mind raced with possibilities. An intruder? Maybe a ghost? Some sort of monster?
I took a long, deliberate inhale, trying to search my mind and find my bearings as I rose from my seat. I began to walk toward the back side of my house, where the noise came from, but quickly came to the realization that if it was an intruder, I had nothing to defend myself with.
I made my way to the master bedroom, which was closest to me, quickly pulling an old wooden Louisville slugger out of my closet. It was one of my most prized possessions, signed by Campy himself, Roy Campanella. I prayed I wouldn’t have to use it, but I knew if it came down to it, I could make the decision.
I exited my bedroom slowly, stepping through my echoey house as the blood surged through my veins. My body vibrated intensely with nervous shivers as I took step after gut-wrenching step back toward where the noise had been coming from.
I arrived at an empty bedroom that my girlfriend had sworn she would be converting into her office once she finally moved in. I wasn’t sure if it was this room, or the next one down the short hallway that the clapping had escaped from.
The hinges creaked as I slowly opened the wooden door. I thought, for a fleeting moment, that I saw a shadow dance across the corner of my eye, shoot across the room and enter into the closet. A bright light shined in through the blinds mounted in the window, streaking the room in lines of white.
There was nothing in the main area of the room, sending my gaze toward the closet. I could feel my heart rushing in my chest, speeding up with each methodical step I took across the slightly shagged carpeting and closer to the accordion closet doors.
I stretched my hand out, reaching for the small knob. As I grasped it, I couldn’t help but notice a spike of anxiety clamp down on my chest. My breathing became rushed and shallow. A slick layer of sweat found its way to my forehead.
I took a deep breath in and tore the door open. Relief washed over me when the small closet was empty, save for a couple of boxes stacked off to the side. I let my breath out, but soon found myself in the same predicament. There was still one room left to check.
I found my way out of the bedroom and back into the hallway, which felt far too dark for the mid-afternoon. I gripped the baseball bat in my hands, squeezing at the slick handle.
As I stepped slowly up to the door of the bedroom, my hand found its way to the knob and grasped firmly. I tried my best to contain my nerves, but the tremor had returned with a vengeance, causing the knob to rattle in my grip.
I turned it, popped the door open with a click. As I slowly pushed the door open, the same white light poured into the room, partially blocked by the blinds.
The room itself was empty. Neither myself nor my girlfriend had any plans for it. I’d thought about making it my music room, setting up my drums and mounting my guitars on the wall, but had never gotten around to it. The acoustics in the living room were too good to pass up.
I stepped toward the closet, terror clouding my mind with thoughts of a malevolent specter jumping from the closet and tearing me limb from limb. The image of a man wearing all black and hiding out with nothing but a large butcher’s knife was the next to enter my mind.
I reeled, hesitating to open the closet.
“H-hel-hello?” I called out in a terrified whisper.
There was no reply. Nothing but eerie and unsettling silence filled the air.
As I reached for the small handle, shaking violently, I heard something come from the living room. The sound of my drums began ringing throughout the house. The beat that played was familiar. It was a quick 4/4 that slowly worked its way into a smooth solo. Intricate paradiddles, singles, doubles and even triple bass notes blared throughout the home.
The dreadful horror gripped me, but I couldn’t work my way out of the room. I couldn’t move from my position as the somewhat soothing notes rang through the air. I found myself with my eyes closed for a moment, basking in the sounds.
It didn’t take long before the solo was complete, maybe a minute or two. I slowly opened my eyes and set the bat at my feet, freeing my hands to do as they pleased.
Before I knew it, I was slowly and methodically clapping my hands together. The loud sound rang out of the room and echoed through the house.
I heard something shuffling around in the living room, then the air became still and silent again. I knew whoever, or whatever it was would come looking for me. They would seek out the source of the noise.
I ran to the bedroom door and closed it quickly, keeping it silent as it swung back into the frame. Then, I ripped open the closet trying my hardest to keep the door from squeaking as it slid along the track.
I knelt over, grabbed the bat off the ground and, forgetting the fear I once felt, stepped inside.I sat in there for a moment. The sheer terror of what would come searching began to rip through my mind.
I could hear a faint creak as they opened the spare bedroom door.
After a grueling minute or two, the door to the bedroom I was hiding in had begun to shake on its hinges before swinging open. Someone stepped inside, holding something long and cylindrical in what appeared to be human hands. They paused just outside the closet door, hand outstretched as if they were about to open the door and reveal my hiding spot.
Then I heard a voice.
“H-hel-hello?” they whispered.
Then, everything went black."	9.83	12.0	Jon Thomas	04/18/2020
The Girl the Universe Forgot	"The Mandela Effect. That phrase never meant anything to me. Spooky, I guess, but it wasn’t something I thought about for more than five minutes. I mean, honestly, until college, I didn’t even know what it was. I’m not one for conspiracy theories or ghost stories or anything like that, so what would you expect? I wish I was still so ignorant.
It all began in my Life Science class. I was twenty at the time, and it was pretty close to the end of the Fall Semester at FSU. My professor, Doctor Arnault, had given us our finals early, because she had a heart and didn’t want us to be studying for everything at once. She figured doing our finals before everybody else’s gave us time to study hers without any distraction, and then gave us time to study everybody else’s with a little less stress.
I loved her for that.
But part of me wishes she never had decided to bless us that way.
On the last day of class, most people skipped. Everybody knew we weren’t really doing anything and everybody just wanted to be done for the semester. Still, some of us were bound by the attendance policies on our scholarships, and others, just out of courtesy to Doctor Arnault, showed up. I personally was present because I loved her class.
One more hour and fifteen minutes of her teaching was a win for me. And, hell, I had nothing better to do.
She began the class slightly differently than she usually did. We’d often start out with a current event from earlier in the week- something about GMO’s, the dramatically declining population of giraffes, or something else relating to life science. But today, we looked at an older article, and something far from relative to biology. It was about the Mandela Effect. I’d never heard of it before; most of us hadn’t. But she was passionate about it. The old lady was usually pretty sprightly while teaching, choleric when somebody disagreed with her- but, man, today she was ecstatic.
“All right. To those of you considerate enough to show up to my class today, I have a treat for you. I’m going to teach you all about something that you’ll probably never forget. Or maybe you’ll blow it off; I don’t know. But if this intrigues you like it did me, I’m sure you’ll be happy you arrived. Can somebody tell me when Nelson Mandela died?”
Everyone looked around confusedly. Then a girl raised her hand.
“He died a couple years ago. 2012 I think.”
She slowly nodded, studying the class like she was waiting for something. And she found that something.
“Seagrave,” she pointed at a boy in the class, “why the confused face?”
“Well, uh, I thought he died like, a while ago. The nineties or something. In prison.”
She beamed with delight.
“Well, class? Is Amanda right? Or Cole?”
Everyone seemed conflicted. Most of us were like me and honestly had no clue. But a couple people agreed with Cole, and one other person agreed with Amanda.
“Amanda,” Dr. Arnault commended, “you’re closer to correct. He died from a respiratory tract infection on December 5th, 2013. But, why did some of you think he died in prison in the early nineties, then? Several of you thought that. Badaar,” she motioned at one of the guys to explain, “where’d you come to that conclusion.”
“I could swear we learned that in seventh grade. In my world history class. It was part of black history month.”
“Yeah, same here,” one of the girls nodded. “Black history month when I was a kid. He died and then there was this thing about his wife trying to sue some company…?”
“Exemplary,” Dr. Arnault was more complacent than I’d ever seen her. “You remember all this being said. Except, strangely enough, it never was. None of this was ever said. Look it up. Go to Google and search ‘Nelson Mandela, Death.’ You’ll find nothing about the nineties or a prison. For that matter, type in ‘Nelson Mandela Prison Death.’ You won’t find a CNN article or a documentary about his funeral which was televised all over the globe. You won’t find his purported cause of death, and you’ll find nothing about the riots in South African cities afterward. Because none of it happened.”
This left me a little weirded out. Most of the class was silent now and waiting for her to make sense of it.
“It’s a phenomenon known as the Mandela Effect,” she grinned. “A complete mystery. An enigmatic anomaly on Earth with no scientific explanation.”
And from that point, the hour and fifteen minutes flew by. I thought five minutes had elapsed when it was time to be dismissed. It left me absolutely mind-boggled.
Basically, it’s this theory that Nelson Mandela did die in prison in the nineties. But then, something happened that somehow reversed this event, and he went on to live decades longer, before dying again in 2013. Though some of us don’t remember Mandela dying in the twentieth century, others do. They remember the news coverage, the papers, the heartfelt speech from his widow- but all of it vanished from the universe when this “event” took place and rewrote history. And all that’s left is this huge collective memory. These people that “know” he died like this, and all remember that same thing somehow, but it’s “wrong.” Personally, I don’t remember being told Mandela died in the nineties. But a lot of people did, and do.
There are two theories behind it. The first and less common is time travel. They say that someone went back in time and altered an event just slightly, but it created a ripple effect that resulted in something changing dramatically. Here’s a made-up example.
Bob married Sally. Bob and Sally met downtown some time back in August of 2005; Bob’s dog just got ran over and he was grieving, and when he saw Sally walking her dog, he couldn’t help but walk over and talk to her. Before long, they were in love and married. Well, then, Jake goes back in time, to the same town around the same time. Jake’s driving on the road about the same time Bob’s dog got run over, but since Jake’s driving, and he’s in front of the car that hit Bob’s dog, and since Jake is a better driver, he comes to a halt and never hits it. The dog runs back over to Bob completely fine. So, now, when Bob goes downtown, he doesn’t think twice when he sees Sally walking her dog, and they never say a word to each other. They each get married to somebody else, and now their son, who could’ve cured Cancer or something, never exists.
But time travel is believed to be entirely fictional and improbable. The more common theory is that there are several universes, all alternate, and that sometimes they “rub shoulders,” or, essentially, cross paths. Like, two cars in a really minor accident. A fender bender. Universe A rear-ends Universe B, and almost everything is the same, except Universe A needs a new bumper. Well, in literal terms, now something between Universe A and Universe B is swapped. Nelson Mandela lived to 2013 and died of a respiratory tract infection and not in prison in the nineties, and now, everybody in Universe B thought he died from a lung infection instead of in an African jail. This one’s the commonly believed one.
After Dr. Arnault’s class, I looked more into it, and there are other examples too. Take “The Berenstain Bears,” for example. We all read those books as kids; or, at least, our parents read them to us. Well, without looking, how was their name spelled?
Berenstein?
Berenstain?
Which one?
If you said “Berenstein,” you’re one of thousands of others that would bet their house you’re right. But you’re wrong. It was never spelled that way. And what about Curious George? Did he have a tail? What position is The Thinker making? Is his fist pressed against his head, or is his hand not even balled up, slumped into his cheek, his fingers extending all the way to his chest?
Curious George does not have a tail, and The Thinker is doing the latter position.
These things may seem silly, but if they’re wrong, why do so many people believe them to be true? Personally, I have my own theory about the Berenstain Bears and Curious George. When you read the name “Berenstain,” it looks Jewish, or German. And like many Jewish or German surnames, you think of it as ending in “stein” instead of “stain.” Take for instance “Goldstein,” “Perlstein,” hell- “Einstein!” We all know that name. “Berenstain” just doesn’t look right, and over time, our minds filled in the “a” with an “e.” Same with Curious George. He’s a monkey, for god’s sake. Of course, we think he had a tail. He’s even commonly portrayed hanging from a vine, with his head down and his butt up in the air, as if he’s hanging from his tail. These are more like the power of suggestion: through external factors, our memories of these simple things were altered.
But then you have The Thinker, King Tut’s burial mask, and Nelson Mandela, of course. If The Thinker really is posing with his hand in a relaxed, non-curled, flat motion, pressed against his cheek, which is folding over his knuckles, why do we remember his hand completely balled up and resting against his head? And not just us, but popular cartoons depict it this way as well! Why do so many people make this mistake?
And King Tut’s burial mask: what is on the top of the mask, right between his eyes? There’s a figure depicted there, an animal, to be more specific. For those of you that thought “snake, duh,” you’re like me. But, you’re wrong. At least, partly. There’s a snake. And a bird. A bird that looks so outlandish and unnatural on that mask that I can’t even look at it without shaking my head.
There couldn’t have been two animals! That looks ridiculous! Look it up on Google and see for yourself. I remember in sixth grade, I had a world history textbook with that burial mask on the cover. I looked at that thing every damn day. Hell, when I was nodding in class, that’s where my eyes fell: down onto the cover of that book which was sitting on my desk. I never saw that bird. I thought that maybe it could’ve just been the angle, but the bird sticks out so far that there’s no way you can’t see it, unless the mask was turned completely away from you, which it never is. And if it was, you wouldn’t be able to see the snake, either. I’m not the only one that remembers it looking like this. Popular cartoons draw it wrong all the time, too.
But there was always a bird on that thing, since 1323 BC.
Well, enough of my rambling. You might be wandering what all this has to do with me.
See, after Dr. Arnault’s class that day, I couldn’t get this off my mind. I was so spooked out by it, so morbidly intrigued, that it just occupied my thoughts. I felt like a victim of it. But still, it wasn’t some grand epiphany of mine, some life-changing philosophy. After all, I was too busy studying for exams to ponder it that often. But all that changed when I sat down with my friend Asher a week later for breakfast.
Asher and I had been friends since first grade. We met at Tawas City Christian Academy in Michigan, in a town with a population of less than ten-thousand. It was always freezing there, dreary and grey, and silent. You could see the whole town from a five-story building. There were miles and miles of abandoned cornfields, and the only real moneymaker in the town was its small harbor at which fishing occurred. I discovered later-on that apparently in other countries, Tawas City, Michigan, is known as the “Bird Watching Capitol of the World.” Purportedly, a vast array of bird species migrate there, and it’s great for bird-watching. I never noticed that. All I can remember is the snowy, grey skies, the silent cornfields, and the feeling that if the place was wiped off the face of the Earth, no one would notice.
Naturally, the public school was puny, but the private school- it hardly existed. In my class, there were fifteen of us. Sixteen, including the teacher.
So I thought.
“I’m starving, man,” Asher sighed, walking ahead of me into the diner.
It was early on a Saturday morning. It was the last week of the semester and we’d been studying like crazy. We figured our day would be spent doing the same thing as usual: an amalgamation of studying endlessly and resisting the urge to buy Adderall, which was pretty prominent on the campus around that time. But my day didn’t consist of that at all.
We sat down at our usual booth, Asher’s hair as red and messy as usual. He was a ginger, and a mischievous one at that. He was a prankster and barely passed his classes; he was here for the booze and the girls, and his grades reflected it. But as best friends do, I forced him to study and pass.
Still, breakfast was a school-free zone. All mention of classes and tests was off-limits at the diner. Here, we wanted to rid our minds of it all. The last time we met up, I went on and on and on about the Mandela Effect, to the point he wanted to shove scissors in his ears, so I tried not to mention it today.
“I’m telling you, man…” he sipped his coffee. “When this is over, we’re partying like crazy. Like crazy, Sean. I don’t want to remember where I am when I wake up that morning.”
I chuckled. “Yeah, man, for sure. Don’t you sometimes wish we were back at Tawas Christian? I mean, not back in Tawas City. But just, the classes? We thought they were so hard…” we both laughed. “God, we were wrong.”
“Yeah, that was a whole different universe, bro. Shit was so easy compared to now. And there were only fourteen of us in total, unless you include Ms. Davis, which is fucking crazy.”
“Fourteen? I think it was fifteen, man.”
He looked confused. “Nah, bro, fourteen. Me, you, Erin Engels, Tyler Mahoney, Zach O’Toole, that quiet girl named Grayson, Elizabeth, Norman, that one kid… Uh… I don’t remember his real name but we all called him Taz.” We called him Taz because he talked so fast nobody could hear what the fuck he was saying.
I chuckled as I remembered him.
“There was Brian Reed, Amy, the twins George and Jordan Reynolds, and that one nerdy kid. Dylan. And then, Ms. Davis. That’s fifteen including her.”
“And Eve.”
He squinted his eyes.
“Who?”
“Eve. The shy girl. Remember? Short, blonde? Brown eyes? Didn’t talk to anybody?”
He shook his head. “That was it, man. There were fourteen of us.”
“No, dude,” I replied, “there was Eve. I’ve been waiting for you to name her the whole time.”
He just looked at me like I was telling him bread was a liquid.
“Asher, are you messing with me? Stop, dude.”
“I’m not messing with you. There just wasn’t an Eve. I distinctly remember fourteen of us. Remember? Four girls, ten guys?”
“No,” I shook my head, “five girls, ten guys. That’s how it was. Her name was Eve. She didn’t talk to anybody and we both never said anything to her. You’re messing with me and it isn’t funny,” I started to feel panicked. “I’ve been reading all that shit about the Mandela Effect and now you’re trying to freak me out. Come on, stop it, man.”
Now he looked frustrated. “Stop with that Mandela shit. There’s no Eve. You’re sleep-deprived.”
“What…?” I was getting annoyed, but also terrified. All this hysteria I’d embraced lately as I considered if the Effect could be real left me feeling hopelessly crazy as Asher argued with me. I knew there was an Eve. She went to Tawas Christian with us. Her face was easy for me to recreate in my mind.
“Sean…” he looked at me intently. “Are you fucking with me?”
“No…” I replied, trying not to sound panicked.
It was such a simple situation. Asher just forgot about her. It was over a decade ago and she wasn’t by any means a notable student. She shied away from conversation, sitting in the back of the room with nothing to say. She only talked when forced to by Ms. Davis and none of us struck up conversation with her.
“Bro, you’re just forgetting about her. She was quiet, man. Like, really quiet. First grade was a long damn time ago.”
“Maybe,” he shrugged. “Honestly, though… No, I can’t be. I can’t be. I remember that class easily. There were fourteen of us. You must be thinking about something else.”
“Don’t tell me I’m thinking about something else!” I felt hopeless.
“What the hell was that?” he glared at me.
“Man, this isn’t funny! You know that Mandela shit’s been freaking me out! Please… Asher… Stop…” I pleaded.
He looked horrified.
“Sean… I’m not fucking with you… Why you getting so worried, bro? Here,” he slid me his coffee, “just, relax, man. Relax… It’s not a big deal. You’re fine.”
“She was there with us… Asher, remember reading group? There were fifteen of us. There were five of us in each group. Eve was in my group.”
“No, man. I mean, you’re right about there being five in each group. But Ms. Davis was in a group. Remember?”
“No, she walked around and supervised,” I argued. “Asher, Eve was in my group. I know she was, because every time she was forced to read, she’d choke up and not say anything. And then the few times she did read I was always enamored to actually be hearing her voice. Because I never did. Like, no one did.”
Asher was still and silent. Both of us knew what we knew. But one of us was wrong. Right?
“Dude…” I begged. “I… Her car. Remember that at least? Her mom dressed nicely. In a dress, always. She’d come to pick Eve up in that fancy black car. I never gave a shit about cars and I still don’t. In my senior year of high school I thought that Altima was a car make. I couldn’t tell the difference between a Porsche and a Honda. But I remember her car because it was so nice looking. It was probably a Cadillac or something. Come on, man, we use to always think it looked cool when it came into the pick-up loop. Her mom was the first to arrive every day, and Eve would get up quickly from her lone corner on the bench and trudge over to the car. And her mom would come out, dressed nicely, even if it was snowing, and hug her. Every single time. And she always smelled nice because her mom hugged her every morning too and got her perfume on her.”
Now Asher actually looked worried.
“Sean…” he shook his head. “I don’t remember her. I’d say you’re thinking of someone else from another school, but we’ve gone to the same school since first grade. And I don’t remember her. Ever. Maybe it was someone you met in preschool.”
“No, no, we both talked about her. She was in my reading circle in Ms. Davis’s class.”
“What about after that? You’re only talking about first grade.”
“I don’t remember her after that. She must’ve moved. But she was in first grade. That’s probably why you forget her. She moved and you just remember all of us that graduated fifth grade there.”
“No, man… I remember first grade too. She wasn’t there. Ms. Davis was my favorite teacher. I remember that year easy. There wasn’t a girl named Eve.”
I don’t really know why, but I felt like crying. Imagine that all your life, you never believed in ghosts. Then you see this horror movie or something, and there’s a scene where the main character is looking in a mirror, and then his reflection stops following him and does its own thing, and it’s horrifying. After that, you just keep thinking about that scene because it scared you so much. But hey, it’s just a movie. It’s not real. And that’s the only thing keeping you from never looking into mirrors again.
But then you figure out the movie’s based on a true story.
Okay, anybody could say that. It’s “based on a true story” like all horror movies. Just because it could be true doesn’t mean it is. Nothing’s hitting close to home.
And then it happens to you.
You get out of the shower. You’re drying off, and you happen to look into the mirror. You raise your towel to dry off your hair, but when your reflection comes into view, its arms are at its side and it’s staring at you.
Holy shit!
You’re terrified. It’s real! It happened to you, and there’s no denying it!
That’s how I felt at that table. Maybe it wasn’t as concrete, but I knew Eve was in that class. I remembered her like the back of my hand. But Asher didn’t. Not at all.
It was just like the bird on King Tut’s burial mask, like The Thinker’s flimsy hand stretching the skin of his cheek, like the absent footage of Nelson Mandela’s huge funeral in the early nineties.
I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. For the rest of the day, I didn’t study anything. I was too overwhelmed. I tried my hardest to assimilate Eve into a preschool memory, but she was incompatible. She didn’t fit.
She didn’t fit at my old church.
She didn’t fit in my neighborhood growing up.
She didn’t fit anywhere but Ms. Davis’s first grade class.
Finally, that night, I called my mother on the phone. At this point, I wasn’t entirely convinced I was witnessing the Mandela Effect; some part of me figured Asher had just smoked too much reefer in high school and forgot about her. And I knew how to find out if I was right.
I told my mom that she wouldn’t hear much from me this week because of all the studying I’d be doing, which she totally respected. So, she was pretty surprised when I called her.
“Hey, Sean!” she sounded excited. “What’s up?”
“Hey, Mom! I wanted to ask you something. Do you remember a girl named Eve in Ms. Davis’s class? A short blonde girl with brown eyes?”
“That’s a random question,” she replied. “Um, no, it doesn’t ring a bell. On your seventh birthday, you invited over all the kids, but I don’t remember an Eve.”
“Yeah, I invited her but she didn’t come,” I remembered. “She was really shy. That’s probably why you forgot her.”
“Well, I have some pictures of you in first grade. I could send them to you and you could point her out to me if you see her in them. Why are you asking, anyway?”
“Well, Asher doesn’t remember her either. It’s just weirding me out a little bit.” I chuckled, trying to hide my nervousness. “Yeah, it’d be cool if you sent those pictures. Do you have the one of the whole class?”
“The one with all fourteen of you?”
The words left me severely uncomfortable.
“Uh, fifteen. There were fifteen of us, Mom.”
“No, fourteen, I thought.”
“What… the fuck…?” I whispered. “Mom… Yeah, just, send me the pictures, if you can.”
“Okay. Is everything okay, Sean?”
“Just feeling weird. It’s weird nobody remembers her.”
“I don’t have the class picture,” she sighed. “I wish I did. Asher’s mom might. See if Asher can get it from her. But I’ll send you the ones I have!”
“Okay, thanks, Mom.”
We talked a bit longer after that, but my mind wasn’t occupied by the conversation. All I could think about was Eve. I could remember her short body, her perfect posture, the quaint dresses she wore to class. I could remember her scent that to this day still appeared sometimes in supermarkets or in a lecture hall for a fading second, just long enough to remind me of first grade. I could remember her voice when she finally worked up the courage to read in our reading circle… I could remember everything about her. I knew I’d be able to point her out if she showed up in any of the pictures.
Still, what bothered me was this: the Mandela Effect is a smooth criminal. It’s articulate, pin-point, exact- it leaves no trace behind. Here’s what I mean.
The Thinker, for instance. A lot of people remember taking pictures with it. They know The Thinker didn’t look the way it does now when they took the picture, so they go back and find their old vacation album, brushing the dust off and reluctantly finding them posing with their ex-wife before the statue. And all the work and awkwardness of thumbing through the old album was for nothing, because in the picture, The Thinker is doing exactly what they remember it wasn’t doing.
Even weirder are the pictures that went viral of people standing right in front of the statue posing with their fist against their head. They’re in front of the damn thing. Don’t you think they’d maybe notice it wasn’t doing what they thought it was doing, and not pose incorrectly right in front of it? But maybe they’re not complete idiots, or just downright oblivious. Maybe when they took that picture there… it was pressing its fist against its skull. And then, when the Mandela Effect occurred at some untraceable, inexact moment in time, the picture changed. But only the statue. It left everything else that wasn’t the statue the same, resulting in the bizarre image of people posing incorrectly right in front of it.
I knew that if this was the Mandela Effect I was dealing with, there’d be no point at all to receiving these pictures. Whether or not Eve was standing there when the picture was taken thirteen years ago, she wouldn’t show up in them.
The only way to catch the Mandela Effect is through relative things. Like the people posing wrong in front of the statue. And this wasn’t relative. If the universe pulled Eve from existence, then she wouldn’t be present in any of the Polaroids.
But I wanted to check anyway. Maybe something would stand out.
My mom sent four pictures; the first was of me, Asher, Brian Reed, Taz, and Norman playing at aftercare one day in the mud. The second wasn’t useful either; just me and Asher sitting at a picnic table one night at open house. The third picture, however, was interesting. It was of the Christmas Concert. All fifteen of us were taught three church songs to sing at the concert and our parents came and watched. It was humiliating for all of us, except maybe Erin, who was born to be a star- but it was especially embarrassing for Eve. This photo jogged my memory immediately. And what made it so strange was the formation of the girls.
In the picture, you can see all of us on stage. There is a one riser on the stage, and some of us were standing on it, while the others were standing in front on the stage itself. On the left side are the boys, five in front, and five on the riser. On the right are the girls: three in front, and one on the riser, between two of the girls. It looks like somebody’s missing in the picture.
You have Erin on the left, then Amy next to her, then Elizabeth next to her, and then Grayson is standing on the riser between Erin and Amy. Eve would fit perfectly between Amy and Elizabeth.
Perfectly.
Why the hell would they put three girls on the stage and one girl alone on the riser, asymmetrically? Especially when the boys are lined up perfectly? It made no damn sense.
And I remember Eve there that night, how scared she was. I remember her white dress and thinking that for once, we were all dressed like her, and she didn’t stand out. And I remember her crying backstage and being scared to death to go out, and not singing the entire time but just freezing up.
I’d bet my soul that all that happened.
The final picture was also useless: just me and Brian Reed in a kickball game that we played on the last day of school. Brain Reed was trying to peg me out and I’m running like a madman for first base.
I saved that picture of the Christmas Concert onto my phone. It was just the proof I needed to show Asher.
The next day, when I ran into Asher, I showed him the picture. To my surprise, this actually affected him. He seemed nervous when he started to consider how weird the picture looked. He told me that if I had mentioned Eve now, after he’d seen the picture, he would’ve just thought it was a coincidence. But since I mentioned Eve before either of us had seen it, that made it a lot stranger. Still, he wasn’t ready to believe in the Mandela Effect. Not like I was.
But he was curious enough to ask his mother if she had our class picture.
She did.
Both of us waited anxiously for her to send it. I couldn’t remember anything about the picture. Still, I wanted to see if there was a strange placement of students like the Christmas Concert, and so did Asher. When he got the message, both of us were shaking with anxiousness. The moment I saw it, I gasped.
“Remember!” I jumped. “The bee-sting!”
“Huh?!” Asher flinched, startled by my screaming.
“Asher!” I grabbed him. “See how we’re standing like that?! It was because of Eve!”
Ms. Davis stood in the middle of us, seven of us on her left, and seven of us on her right. Those on her left were turned slightly to face her, thus the left sides of their faces were showing and the right sides were blocked. And those on her right were turned leftward, so their right was facing the photographer. What stood out was the ample negative space in the picture. When groups pose in this fashion, it’s a way to shrink the size of the group. Usually, the cameraman has trouble fitting all the people in the shot, and thus they form this way so they can all scrunch up and fit, but still look natural. But in this picture, it’s easy to see that we had more than enough room to stand correctly and still fit.
That wasn’t the reason we stood that way.
“Asher!” I felt as if I’d stricken gold. “We’re all posed like that ‘cause Eve got stung by a bee! Dude, tell me you remember! We were going in to take the picture and she got stung right underneath her right eye. Her face got all swollen and she was crying because she didn’t want to look like that in the picture, so the photographer said to pose like this, and Eve could turn the left side of her face to the camera!”
“Dude…” Asher scratched his head. “We just posed like this so we could save room…”
“No, we didn’t. There’s no reason to do that. There’s so much room on the left and right side, it’s unnatural, even. We wouldn’t’ve done it for that reason.”
“I don’t remember anything like that happening, man… Honestly, this is starting to weird me out. I think we should just forget about it.”
“I… I can’t forget about it…” I replied. “She was real… I can’t believe nobody can remember her.”
There was only one option left for me to do. I had to have a reunion with them. If we all met up and others of us remembered Eve, I’d know I wasn’t crazy. Most of us hadn’t spoken in years. Still, I had Erin as my friend on Facebook. She talked all the time about having a reunion now that we were all in our twenties, and I knew if I mentioned it, she’d ruthlessly try to put it together.
I contacted her that night and she was completely on board. All of us were about to be free from college for Winter Break, and I suggested we meet back in Tawas City. I was going down there anyway to see my family for Christmas. My mom had long suggested I throw a reunion at the house; she said she’d be honored to host and cater it. When I told Erin about it, she couldn’t be more compliant. She assured me she’d contact the others. All fifteen, she said.
My heart raced. I asked, “All fifteen?”
“Yeah,” she responded, “all fifteen, us and Ms. Davis.”
And at that moment, I felt another sense of dread. Erin always tried to keep the group together. Her forgetting Eve meant something was seriously wrong.
When December 18th arrived, I was shocked to pull into my old driveway. I hadn’t been there in years. Usually on Christmas, they came down to Tallahassee to visit me. It wasn’t anything against them; I just hated Tawas City. Around Christmas time it was freezing cold, and most of its residents went south for the winter if they could afford it. It was a ghost town, and a frigid one at that.
My parents had picked me up from the airport and driven me here. The entire way, I reminisced. As we passed through the frozen-over cornfields, under the bleak white sky, I felt like I’d been here yesterday. Nothing was different. It was all completely recognizable. Perhaps the only difference was some of the old buildings looked somehow even older, even more decrepit and abandoned.
Throughout the drive, and especially when I got back to my house before anyone else arrived, really all I could think about was Eve. I felt closer to her here in this ominous, forgotten town. Back entrenched in the snow, something I hadn’t felt in years, I sensed that she was in arm’s reach of me. I knew that if I were to ever find closure, it’d be at this reunion. If just one other person remembered her, then I wasn’t crazy. Then the Mandela Effect was real, and Eve was real, and Asher was wrong.
God, I prayed for that closure.
At four o’clock, all of us that could make it arrived. Ms. Davis was unfortunately busy with her family, as her father was dying and they didn’t know how much time he had left, and Norman was completely untraceable. The last of us to hear from him was Brian Reed, who remembered Norman getting into trouble some time around eighth grade and going to Juvenile Detention. After that, he pretty much vanished.
Not like Eve, though. He was still in the pictures. They still remembered his name.
When the other twelve showed up at the house, I forgot about Eve for just a moment. Seeing Erin again was awesome. She was as beautiful and energetic as always, her long brown hair now styled maturely and her vibrant green eyes now only wiser. Tyler Mahoney was also just as handsome as he’d always been. The stud was still dressed to kill, even in the freezing weather. Brian Reed had joined the Navy and was on Liberty. He was even bigger now than he was then, and was engaged to his girlfriend since high school.
Grayson, on the other hand, was not favored by time. She looked older than she was, remained far shorter than most of us, and her face was covered with acne. Still, she was a lot more outgoing than any of us could remember. Zach looked a lot like how I remembered; tan, skinny. The only difference was now, he had a moustache. He’d worked at Home Depot ever since high school and was still living with his parents that moved to Minnesota. Amy was unrecognizable; she had bright blue hair now, which wasn’t necessarily a surprise considering how rebellious she was growing up, but the piercings were unprecedented.
Elizabeth was much like she always was; generally quiet and sweet, with her alluring amber eyes that nobody could forget. Dylan didn’t look the way any of us thought he would. He was now ravishing, tall, and wore rich stubble along his grand face. He still wore glasses, and I’m glad; contacts on Dylan would’ve just been staggering. He had a higher GPA than even Erin, and all of us were proud of him.
George and Jordan both looked a lot different now; George was a construction worker and was wiry and stout. Jordan, on the other hand, was more reserved, and amusingly taller than his twin brother George. Jordan’s hair was neat and short; George’s hair was a thick mess of black curls. They didn’t even speak the same anymore. George spoke profanely and Jordan seemed to be a stranger to vulgarities. It was intriguing to see them so different.
Taz was just as goofy as ever. To our surprise, he’d been going to college and was working on a Business Degree. But when he talked about something he was passionate about, you couldn’t understand a word he was saying. The moment he stepped inside, he blabbered on and on and on, and all we could do was laugh. He was just as crazy as ever.
Asher and I were generally believed to look the same. Asher’s hair was still red, mine still brown. His eyes were still green, mine blue. His face was still freckly, mine smooth. He was still a prankster, and I was still quiet most of the time. The only difference was both of us were more in shape, since we started running together.
But the complacent joy of seeing all my friends again only distracted me for a short while. Before long, my thoughts were back on Eve. I waited for her to come in the door, but I knew she never would. I waited for somebody to mention her, but I knew it would never happen. With Ms. Davis and Norman accounted for, “everyone was here.”
It disheartened me to say the least.
Maybe I was crazy. Maybe I read too much about the Mandela Effect, and that bee-sting thing was just the power of suggestion, and that Christmas Concert picture was just weird. Maybe I dreamed of Eve once or she was in my preschool and I just screwed it all up in my head. There was no way to be sure.
After dinner, we all went into the living room and talked. I tried to enjoy myself but something just felt wrong. Eve should have been there. It bothered me so much that no one had asked about her, and I knew I had to bring her up.
But I didn’t want to look crazy. Asher had asked me not to mention her, and I didn’t want to annoy him. I also wasn’t prepared to hear them tell me they remembered her. What would I do, then? I wouldn’t be delusional… but then what? The horror of trying to accept what became of her… that would be close to impossible. I wanted so badly to hear from someone that she was real, but I didn’t know how I’d ever forget her if I had to really imagine the universe forgetting her, “bumping shoulders” with some alternate dimension and ripping her from the snowstorms of Tawas City to some other place light years away, most of it looking the same, with the exception of a few things that were just eerily different.
I wanted to stay quiet. I wanted to just forget about her. But I knew that wasn’t an option. I didn’t know what was more disturbing to me: The Mandela Effect happening so close to home in my life, or me being this delusional. Either way, I had to know. I could hold it in no longer.
“Hey, guys…” I spoke up nervously. “I… I need to ask you all a question.”
Asher looked disappointed.
“What’s up, Sean?” Brian Reed asked.
“Look… this might sound, uh… weird… but… where’s Eve?”
“I was thinking that the whole time!” Tyler Mahoney spoke up, and my heart stopped.
I wasn’t crazy. I WASN’T crazy. Somebody else remembered her!
And no one else did.
There was confused silence devouring the room now. Asher looked as if he’d seen a ghost. I myself was horrified and at the same time, overwhelmed with relief.
“Eve?” Erin asked. “Eve who?”
“I don’t remember her last name,” Tyler replied. “Quiet. Short blonde chick. Wore a dress all the time.”
“Holy shit…” Asher muttered, bewildered. “Holy… shit…”
“Am I missing something?” Amy asked.
“There was a girl named Eve in our first-grade class…” I spoke up. “But… nobody remembers her. At least, I thought nobody did,” I chuckled nervously. “But, Tyler, you do. Man, I thought I lost my fucking mind. She’s not in any of the pictures. Not a damn one. There’s no sign of her ever existing except for my memories, and I swear to god I thought I’d gone off the deep end. But, Tyler… You remember her too. That brings me so much closure.”
“There was no Eve…” Dylan responded. “I don’t recall an Eve. I remember each of you distinctly. I can’t imagine how I would have forgotten one of you completely, and yet vividly remembered the rest of you.”
“I agree,” Jordan chimed in. “There were four girls. I remember that easily. There wasn’t a fifth.”
“Yeah, there was,” Tyler replied, which gave me so much peace. “I had a crush on her. Remember? Not to sound like a douchebag but all you girls liked me,” he faced them, and none could deny it. “But then I had a crush on Eve. And-”
“The note!” I burst into uproarious laughter, recalling it instantly.
“Yeah!” Tyler laughed.
The room was portentously silent.
“I liked Eve,” Tyler chuckled. “Nobody knew why I liked her because she was all silent and standoffish, but I just fell for her. So, I wrote her this super corny embarrassing note, and I went to hand it to her.”
“And you got caught,” I finished, just wanting to see it all line up again. “And Ms. Davis confiscated it. And everybody wanted to know what it said because when she read it, she started laughing her head off.”
“And it was the most embarrassing day of my life,” he grinned. “You guys don’t remember?”
Most of them looked uncomfortable.
“I… I don’t remember an Eve,” Elizabeth spoke with certainty. “Never do I remember that name. I don’t remember the day you’re talking about… and, we all certainly did used to snicker about you,” she smiled, but looked troubled. “All of us girls. I think we’d remember that.”
“It happened,” Tyler shrugged. “How would Sean and I remember the same thing? Exactly the same thing? And it not really happen?”
And how would everyone remember The Thinker’s fingers balled in a confident fist, when they were in fact flaccidly poking his chest? And how would everyone remember King Tutankhamen’s burial mask with its lone snake as its crowning feature, when all along, there was a lucid, brightly-constructed bird immediately beside it? And how would everyone remember Nelson Mandela’s untimely fate in a downtrodden South African prison, resulting in monstrous civil unrest, vividly recorded footage of his ubiquitously aired funeral, and the tear-jerking lamentation delivered by his widow in his passing? When all of it never fucking happened?
It’s because something disturbing and unthinkable occurred. Something that none of us will ever explain happened, emasculating The Thinker’s resolute stoicism to a pose of deep uncertainty, producing the unnatural bird like a blackhead on King Tut’s burial mask, and turning Nelson Mandela into a zombie who lived unnoticed until he passed away again in 2013, leaving those of us remembering differently absolutely baffled.
“Well… that’s just really weird.”
Erin’s words were the catharsis the room looked for. No matter what Eve’s existence- or lack thereof- meant, none could disagree that it was, in fact, just really weird.
We changed the subject afterward, and most of us seemed to move on rather quickly from the enigma. But I didn’t. It bothered me the entire time, gnawing at me. I wanted to sit and talk with Tyler about Eve all night. I wanted to hear all the stories about her that he remembered. I was dying to ask him if he recollected the bee-sting story.
But it just never came up. I couldn’t ask it. I didn’t want to visit it anymore. It did something to me that I can’t explain to imagine that little girl being stung in the eye, crying before picture day in our snowy, empty town. The memory alone was enough to make me tremble. That poor little girl… showing the left side of her chubby face to the camera… Where was she now? Why couldn’t anyone remember?
I did my best to…
Just.
Forget.
But Eve was stuck in my head. I knew I’d never forget about her. The Mandela Effect was real. She really did exist once. And now she didn’t. What the hell happened to her, then? I mean, really? It was just too terrifying to think about, and I couldn’t forget it, no matter how desperately I tried. Asher seemed to be in my boat.
Most of them stayed the night at my house, since there wasn’t a motel in the entire town, and the majority of our parents had moved. The next day, everyone was out of town except me, having flown out back to the land of the living.
Only I stayed behind in the snow-scoured wasteland of Tawas City, Michigan. Only I remained in this hotspot of the universe, this place where two realities collided.
I didn’t receive the closure I’d wanted from the reunion. We all exchanged numbers and were staying in touch now, which was great, but more than anything, I was constantly bombarded by thoughts of Eve. I just wanted something to make sense. I stayed awake late at night thinking about her voice that I could so simply recall, reading to us There is a Bird on your Head! and Max’s Words. I remembered her so scared at social events and huddling through the snow, still wearing a dress, though adorned with mittens and a scarf, toward her loving mother, where they’d hug outside her fancy black car. I remembered Eve’s crying when the bee stung her eye.
That memory for some reason bothered me more than the others. It just… It just affected me. Something about it really cut deep. She was so innocent, and I felt so bad for her, and now she wasn’t the victim of a simple bee sting, but of some horrible cosmic event, leaving her nonexistent.
My parents wanted me to stick around until Christmas, but the thought of that killed me. I didn’t want to stay in this wasteland for a week. I hated it and now, I was scared to death here. Would I get ripped from my reality into the cosmos? It happened here once already. This mystery just consumed the town to me, drenching it and leaving me constantly reminded of Eve.
The girl that stopped existing.
Days passed and all I did was sit in the living room and watch TV. I enjoyed seeing my parents when they were around, but both worked, and this meant I spent a lot of time alone at the house, which I abhorred. Eventually, I dug through my old closet to find something that might be from first grade. I didn’t find anything.
I did, however, hold in my hands, the picture that Eve was yanked from. The one where she should be between Elizabeth and Amy, but she isn’t. She’s not there, and there’s just that unnatural space in between. Bastard universe. It’s so smug, so omnipotent, that it can leave clues as gaping as this, and yet still, there’s just no way to prove she’s real.
But then, on Christmas Eve, it happened. I got a text from Tyler.
“Sean. I read up on the Mandela Effect. That shit’s got me fucked up. I think that is what happened. But I remember something now and this might really prove Eve existed for sure. The note I wrote her. You stole it. You took it off Ms. Davis’s desk and gave it back to me, but then I told you to keep it and throw it away. You told me later on that you never threw it away but took it home and showed your parents and laughed your ass off every time you read it. Where is it? If you still have it, it’ll be proof.”
“Holy shit!” I gasped when I read the text.
“Holy shit! You’re completely right, Tyler! I’m going to find that note! I swear to god I will and when I do, I’ll send you pictures! Then we can prove she’s real for sure!”
Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Wouldn’t the note not exist now, too? Well, no. See, when the Mandela Effect occurs, only things directly relating to what was changed are altered. That’s why the people posing in front of The Thinker are still posing wrong. That’s why the cartoons in which King Tut’s mask has one snake on it, and no bird, still look like that. The only thing changed is the real deal. So, the actual pictures of Eve: they’re gone. She’s been pulled from them, and there’s not a trace of her remaining. But the note, if I found it, would be just the proof I needed. It would mention her by name.
My dad told me that I could feel free to check the storage unit for the note. Apparently, there he’d placed a lot of the crap I didn’t clean in my closet growing up, and if it was anywhere, it’d be there. I even faintly remembered stealing it now like the rotten kid I was and reading it from time to time for a good laugh.
Some part of me wanted to wait until my dad got off work to check the storage unit with him, but I knew, somehow, that I’d never find the note if he was there. I felt like I had to do it alone.
I drove there through the snow on a day just as bleak and silent as any other in Tawas. I passed the lonely cornfields, the ominous, tower-like silos, the seemingly empty fish shops, and the frozen harbor. It was all just how it always was.
When I got to the storage unit, I was strangely horrified. I felt like I was about to walk into a haunted house. As a kid, the storage unit always scared me. In all my life, I know as a fact, I’ve never seen another soul in that building other than my father. It was always dark and empty, and now, without him by my side, searching for this letter about a ghost… I was mortified.
But I continued on.
I entered the frigid, voluminous metal halls, journeying through them and turning on the lights as I stepped into each corridor. Finally, I arrived at our unit. I dreaded lifting the door. It made a frighteningly loud creak. It unsettled me to hear it, even though I was the one making the noise.
I lifted the door as quietly as possible, which wasn’t quiet at all, then began my hunt. I looked for over an hour. I could barely reach the boxes in the back, and each one was filled to the brim with junk, usually sporting a silverfish or two.
But then I found it: my baseball cards. These were from first grade. They were in a plastic container barely visible under the pile of junk in which it resided, but I grabbed the box, sliding it out of its tomb and into my arms.
I opened the container.
Inside were the baseball cards, a Berenstain Bears book- fucking creepy. And spelled with an “a,” of course. Some doodles and old notebooks… and a folded-up letter. I recognized it instantly.
I held it in my hands. Now, in the lonely, cold, silent, eerie storage unit, I caressed the piece of evidence the universe forgot. I slid open the old paper, hardly able to breathe as I searched for the name.
I unfolded it.
“Dear Eve.”
That was all I had to read. Dear… Eve. Dear, Eve. Dear, Eve.
I folded it up. I slid it in my pocket. I took a long, deep breath, leaning against a pile of dusty boxes. Eve was real. The girl that stopped existing was really here once in this graveyard of a town, and I wasn’t crazy. And somehow, someway, two universes collided, and Eve was ripped into oblivion by the silver fingers of the cosmos, vacuumed from existence without a single trace, except my memories, Tyler’s memories, and the note in my hand.
What happened to her?
Where was she now?
Was she alive?
Where was that sweet, quiet, sobbing girl… and would I ever know?
Probably not.
She’s in a place where Curious George has a tail, and where children grew up reading The Berenstein Bears. She was taught that Nelson Mandela died in a South African prison, and when she pretends to be The Thinker, she isn’t posing wrong.
I hope.
Or maybe, she’s nothing, now. Maybe the universe made a tragic mistake, and that harmless girl will never trudge into her mother’s loving arms again, but instead spend eternity scared to death, trapped in the swirling grey snow.
I have no idea. But as I sat there, all I could do was imagine the ghost of her sitting there with me. I felt so close to her in that place that time forgot, in that meaningless metal room, trapped in a town in which the universe made a mistake.
When I finally flew back to Tallahassee, I couldn’t be more relieved. I vowed that I would never return to Tawas City, Michigan, no matter what the reason. As far as I was concerned, it was better left behind, like Eve was.
But like usual, I just couldn’t escape her.
I texted pictures of the note to Asher and Tyler. Both were equally as messed up.
We all just tried to put it behind us, though. And then Ms. Davis updated her Facebook.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t make the reunion!” she posted. “But, I just want to say that I’ll make the next one for sure! To my favorite class ever!”
She also published a picture, a drawing, from Elizabeth. It was a drawing of the class. It was clearly drawn by a child; amateurish, simple, messy, in colored pencil.
But simple as it was… there was nothing normal about it.
It was a drawing of ten little boys.
And a drawing of five little girls.
A drawing of a short blonde girl with brown eyes, in what could only be distinguished as a dress.
I don’t know how anybody else reacted to that, but I know I’ll never un-see that image.
Even now, all these years later, sometimes, she comes to mind. I can’t help it. I’ve seen horrible and unexplainable things in my life: two towers destroyed by hijacked planes for no reason at all other than sheer hatred, leaving thousands dead. A preschool invaded by an active shooter that employed military tactics, killing little children, and entirely unprovoked by anything. But none of it… none of it… affects me more… than Eve. The girl the universe forgot."	9.08	12.0	D.D. Howard	04/17/2020
Someone Darke	"In the room over his London shop, Darke methodically counted the copper, silver and most especially the gold coins that had poured in during the day. The feel of the cold and beautiful metal in his long, wispy fingers was always comforting to him. The way they glistered in the flickering candlelight was calming, captivating, even mesmerizing. On more than one occasion, his associates had commented that he valued money as an end in and of itself, and not for what it could buy. Darke took this as a compliment, and prided himself upon seldom spending money on anything other than assets to earn more money. He liked his coffers kept full, and was loathed to part with his precious coins for mere frivolities. He was, without doubt, a shrewd and keen businessman, if not the best person to spend a Saturday evening with.
His preference for profits over people, however, meant that he wasn’t always the best of salesmen, in spite of his business acumen. Fortunately, he didn’t need to be.
The wares he peddled in sold themselves.
His coin counting was disturbed by a heavy, demanding knocking on the downstairs door. After-hour calls were not uncommon for an apothecary, the need for their goods often arising at sudden and unpredictable times. Darke scowled at the interruption, but continued counting, trusting his granddaughter to deal with the late customer.
Sure enough, he heard her open the door and her muffled voice speaking with what he guessed was a middle-aged man. He couldn’t make out what they were saying, but his granddaughter’s normally confident and assertive tone dropped to a meek whimper after only a few words from the man. Her footsteps scurried up the stairs and she gently tapped upon his chamber door.
“Who is it, Isidora?” he asked. She opened the door a crack and poked her head in. Her face was so pale and fretful that Darke wouldn’t have been surprised if she said it was The Devil himself who was waiting downstairs.
“He, ah, he says he’s with the Inquisitor’s office, Grandsire,” she muttered.
Darke groaned and glanced down at his pile of coins, realizing that he may need to part with some of it after all.
“Nothing to worry about, my dear. He’s nothing the two of us can’t deal with,” he assured her as he rose to his full height of six and a half feet.
“I know. I know. You’re right. It’s just, I…” she trailed off, an expression of grim horror at the memory of witches and heretics being burned alive in front of her, their screams rising above the roar of the flames, the acrid smoke and stench of burnt flesh assaulting her eyes, nose, and throat.
Darke gently placed his hand on her shoulder and gave her a reassuring smile.
“We’ll get rid of him. Don’t worry,” he instructed. She nodded trustingly, and followed him down the narrow and uneven staircase.
When they reached their well-provisioned yet bleakly utilitarian storefront, the Inquisitor was still waiting by the door, just where Isidora had left him. He was well-dressed in a tailored doublet and fur cloak, and yet carried no extra weight, suggesting that whatever work he did for the Inquisition kept him fairly active. At least one scabbarded dagger hung off his belt, but the weapon that really caught Darke’s attention was the silver cross around the man’s neck; it radiated with holy vital energy, a perfect locus for the man’s unshakable faith.
This might prove harder than Darke had hoped.
“Welcome, good sir, welcome. How may we be of assistance to you this evening?” he asked with a polite bow and forced smile.
“I’m looking for the owner of this establishment,” the Inquisitor said, holding up a piece of parchment. “A Guillaume, or a Percival, or a… someone Darke.”
“I’m someone Darke,” Darke smiled, more sincerely this time, flashing his uncommonly well-preserved teeth. “And this is my Granddaughter, Isidora. Might we have your name, sir?”
“Blodwell will do,” he replied, stuffing the parchment back into his cloak.
“Ah, a fellow bearer of an ominous surname. How delightful. And why is it that Mr. Blodwell needs to speak with someone Darke at such a late hour?” Darke asked, still not completely willing to abandon the hope that Blodwell might actually be in desperate need of his services and have no difficulty in paying for them.
“I’m here to search the premises for contraband,” he declared as he set straight to work rummaging through shelves, drawers, and chests, caring nothing for any damage or inconvenience he might be causing them.
The two Darkes exchanged irritated glances with each other at the Inquisitor’s intrusion.
“Might we ask what reason you have to search our shop, good sir?” Isidora asked in a tone of poorly restrained irritation.
“You know bloody well you may not,” he replied harshly. “I am, however, obligated to give you a single chance to confess to any heresy or witchcraft before I commence interrogations. Confess and you have my word as a Christian that your lives will be spared.”
“Your word as a Christian means –” Isidora hissed, before Darke slapped his hand over her mouth.
“What my granddaughter means is that we have done nothing to warrant whatever accusations may have been levied against us,” he protested, his voice and expression the picture of bewildered innocence. “Surely you’re aware that I am the Consulting Alchemist to the Royal Family?”
Blodwell only scoffed at the appeal to a secular authority.
“And I am the servant of the Almighty God,” he reminded him. “I’m perfectly aware of your connections, Darke; they’re no doubt how you’ve managed to evade justice for so long. Unlike some of my colleagues, you’ll find that no amount of vile gold, political clout, or black magic will keep me from carrying out Our Lord’s will.”
“You forgot mercy or human decency,” Isidora mumbled, her arms folded obstinately across her chest. It was then that Blodwell stopped his search, glaring at her with utter contempt.
“I know a witch when I see one,” he snarled, taking slow, deliberate strides towards her. “Unmarried, childless, working as a healer to accumulate the knowledge and power she covets, so resentful of the place of submission God assigned her that she’d make a deal with the Devil himself to escape her rightful place.”
He was standing right in front of her now, looking down at her with gritted teeth, as if daring her to defy him further so that he could put her in her place.
She wanted to do it. The whole reason she had become a witch was so that she wouldn’t have to live in constant fear of men like Blodwell, so that she could do what she wanted and not what she was told, so that she could take vengeance on anyone who would try to control her…
But she couldn’t. The strength and purity of the vital energy radiating off of Blodwell made it clear that he was sincere in his piety, and just being so close burned her almost as badly as being sprinkled in holy water. His faith, no matter how warped or misplaced it was, protected him from her witchcraft.
She was no match for him physically either, so, shamefully, she bowed her head in obligatory reverence and stepped back as far from him as she could.
“Sir, please, I am a healer, but nothing more,” she whispered softly. “I have committed no crimes, either against The Lord or my fellow Christians. Indeed, I have eased much dis-ease and even saved lives, and could save many more lives if spared from the blaze, perhaps even a life of one dear to you.”
“Free of charge, of course,” Darke added, though it made the bile rise in his throat.
Blodwell just shook his head in disdain.
“The World is as God has willed it, and I do not seek to upend His designs,” he proclaimed. “If God ordains pestilence, violence, famine, and death, then so be it. I will have none of your foul elixirs to defy The Lord, nor will anyone else after this night.”
He turned to look over the front room once again, sighing when he saw that there was nothing he had not already been through.
“You have a backroom? Or some other place where you hoard all your blasphemous charms and potions? Show me now, or you will not live long enough to recant your heresy.”
He drew his dagger now, and held it out towards them menacingly. Its handle was of an unnaturally dark wood, and at first glance, the blade looked to have been forged of damascene steel. However, it glistened just a little too much in the dim light, and the fluid lines throughout the blade actually flowed like water.
“Sorcery!” Isidora screamed, outraged by the blatant hypocrisy, no doubt something he had pocketed from a previous victim. Blodwell backhanded her with his free hand, while raising the tip of the blade to Darke’s throat with the other before he had a chance to retaliate.
“Your hoard, now!” Blodwell ordered. Darke raised his hands up and nodded.
“There’s a hidden trapdoor to the cellar in the storage room,” he confessed. “Isidora has the keys.”
“Show me!” Blodwell spat at her. “Any trickery, and I’ll impale the devil right through his black heart!”
Isidora glanced up at her Grandsire, who nodded as much as he could with a knife at his throat. Grabbing a candlestick, she rushed to the storage room, with Blodwell pushing Darke in front of him and holding the dagger to his back whilst grabbing his collar. Isidora pulled back the Oriental rug in one swift motion, revealing a three-foot by three-foot door built directly into the floor. The lock was placed into a shallow divot that would have been imperceptible if one had been standing atop the thick rug. She unlocked the door and tossed it open, revealing a short wooden staircase going down to the cellar.
“You first, but don’t leave my sight,” Blodwell ordered. Isidora nodded and made her way down the stairs, lifting her skirt with one hand and holding the candle in the other, with Darke and Blodwell only a few steps behind.
The entirety of the cellar had been lined with stone. There was a long table and a chair at one end, but otherwise the cellar was furnished in large chests, caged bookshelves, and locked cabinets, none of which looked eager to give up their secrets.
“You have the keys for all of this as well, I take it?” Blodwell asked.
“I do,” Isidora said matter-of-factly, an inexplicable cheerfulness returning to her voice. “But I won’t be opening any of it for you, you bloodthirsty brute.”
Darke clenched his right fist, and the trap door above them slammed shut.
Blodwell spun around in a panic, racing up the steps and banging on the door, trying to force it open again.
“Thank you ever so much for coming down to our cellar,” Isidora smirked. “I don’t think we could have managed to have killed you without you making a fuss, and it would have been terribly rude to have disturbed our neighbors with the sounds of your screams at this hour. That’s why we went to the courtesy of making sure this cellar is soundproof.”
Blodwell turned and sneered at them in unabashed hatred and rage.
“You knaves think you have me beat? That an old man and a wretched girl can best a man of God with your unholy magic?”
He lunged at Darke, plunging his dagger straight into his heart, as he had promised.
Darke just smiled smugly at him, giving no sign that he was even hurt. When Blodwell removed the blade, there was no blood, only a heavy black miasma that oozed forth and slowly fell to the ground like a cold fog.
“Devil!” Blodwell cried, stumbling backwards and dropping the blade in his utter dismay. “What are you?”
“Someone… Darke,” he smiled, an aura of fluid black darkness encompassing him as he moved in on his prey.
It had indeed proved prudent that they had soundproofed that cellar, for even if Blodwell’s screams hadn’t been loud enough to wake the neighbors, Isidora’s cackling laughter surely would have been.

“Bring out your dead!”
The grimly familiar cry of the body collector rang throughout the street as he pulled the ever-increasing weight of his cart down the uneven cobblestone road on his rounds.
“Yes, Ferdy, just a moment please,” Isidora called from the shop door before ducking back inside. Ferdy set his cart to rest and waited patiently for what was likely to be his best pickup of the day. The Darkes were some of his best customers, with no small number of people dying in their care and no shortage of coin to pay for his services.
They also tended to be rather chipper than the rest of his clients, which was a pleasant change of pace.
Isidora appeared again in a moment, followed by her Grandsire, with a grown man’s body slung over his shoulders.
“Darkey, you got to hire someone to do the heavy lifting for you. You’re getting too old for it,” Ferdy smirked, though not actually offering any assistance of his own. Darke just grunted and let the body fall into the cart while Isidora paid him his fee.
Ferdy eyed the body suspiciously. It didn’t look like the man had died of the plague. In fact, he looked to have been in excellent health before his passing, too healthy for the ill-fitting pauper’s garb that he was wearing. Most unsettling of all though was his face: frozen in a rictus grimace of unadulterated terror and agony.
“Ah… what happened with this one Darkey, ‘case someone asks?”
“Something beyond even our skill to heal, or even diagnose, I’m afraid,” Darke lamented. “He came seeking our aid last evening, complaining of a sudden onset of some rather vague symptoms, and within barely an hour he started having strange, epileptic fits and expired shortly thereafter. We weren’t even able to get his name.”
“Is that so?” Ferdy asked, eyeing the cold, blue face more closely. “I can’t be certain, but I think I might have seen this bloke out and about before. ‘Round Saint Paulie’s, maybe?”
Isidora shifted her gaze up at Darke, who gave her a reluctant nod, and she slipped a few more gold coins into Ferdy’s palm.
“Ah, no, trick of the light. Terrible shame that, his poor widow and little ones never knowing what happened,” he smiled, flipping the body’s face down to prevent anyone else from getting a good look at it. “Don’t you worry Darkes, I’ll see that this bugger’s in a mass grave by sundown.”
“Thank you, Ferdy,” Isidora waved him off as he resumed his morose meanderings. She looked back at her Grandsire, who still seemed not entirely satisfied with the transaction.
“It’s not that bad. We got his clothes, his silver cross, his bewitched dagger, and now there’s one less Inquisitor to pester us. What more could you have asked for?” she asked before heading back inside the shop.
Darke lingered a moment longer, staring at the retreating body cart.
“If we had tossed him to the dogs they might have finished him off by now, sparing us the disposal cost and a few days feed,” he muttered, before heading back inside as well."	9.45	11.0	The Vesper's Bell	04/14/2020
White Out	"Outside the wind shrieked against the window pane, the news had said that there was a blizzard headed her way. Stacey had been rushing around the house since 5 pm trying to get her bags packed. She was hoping to hit the road by seven so that she could get to her mother’s before the storm hit hard.
The twins had been playing in their room quietly for most of the evening with their coloring books. Five years old and already they looked like they had a gift for art. They couldn’t keep the color in the lines but today that just meant they were “thinking outside the box.” She’s grateful they weren’t asking her a million questions for a change. She wanted to get them packed. She wanted to get them gone from here.
Stacey was not going to put up with another night of Tom’s abuse. She had married him seven years earlier and really loved him, but after the twins were born he had changed. The drinking first, then the drug use. At first she blamed the stress of his job, but then she blamed herself.  She tried to pay more attention to him, to his needs, but nothing she did seemed to make him happy. Not the sexy night wear, and not the baby-sitters over the weekend so they could spend time alone together.
Two years ago the violence had started, at first it was just an odd smack when he was angry, but it escalated quickly. One night Stacey had come home from the restaurant to the sound of screams. Rushing into the house she found her husband holding little Chrissy, clutched tight in his hands, her feet dangling from the floor… but it was what she saw in his eyes that scared her the most. Tom’s eyes had no Tom in them. What she saw was completely alien. He was shouting that he wanted Chrissy to shut up or he would kill her, punctuating each word with aggressive shaking of her limp body.
Late that night he apologized. He blamed the stress at work and that he was going to see a doctor about his anger. Damn him!
Sara was next, almost two days later. Then another apology. The “I love you so much, I can’t forgive myself. I need you, I need the girls… You are my life…”
That was the way it went for the next two years. Stacey had not told anyone. She was afraid that if she did, her babies would be taken away from her, and she could not muster up the power to leave him. They had been high-school sweethearts and the kind of power couple everyone assumed would live happily ever after. Also, Tom was the main support of the family. He had been made partner at the firm where he worked shortly after they had been married, and he made excellent money. Stacey had been so proud of Tom, he was the youngest partner there. Without his money, she could not see herself providing well for her children and she felt trapped.
Last night had been the breaking point though. Tom had been good for over a month. She had relaxed a little and went out with her girlfriends. She came home over an hour late. Opening the door, she could hear Chrissy and Sara crying loudly. Tom was shouting incoherently at them. He was holding an egg beater over them and bringing it down again and again over Sara’s bare back. Stacey felt something break in her – she had jumped at Tom and he turned on her with that wild alien look in his eyes. For the first time the sight of her did not bring him back. She felt her face light up in pain. She had been hit with the egg beater. But she held her ground. Somehow, and she could not believe her luck, she had managed to kick that son of a bitch right in the groin.
It was not like the movies though. He did not fall to his knees screaming in pain. Tom’s eyes had rolled into the back of his head and he lurched towards her. Panic for her children emboldened her. She let him get close then grabbed something from behind her on the dresser. The snow globe she managed to grab exploded in a shower of water, glass, and flakes that blinded her. She hoped that those flakes also blinded Tom. But she did not have to worry, Tom was lying on the floor face down with a small trickle of blood on his temple. He lay there motionless. Stacey took the opportunity to lock herself in the master bedroom with her daughters where they huddled in fear all night waiting for Tom to come banging on the door.
The next morning, Stacey woke to the sound of the car pulling into the drive. During the night Tom had managed to wake up and get out of the house and away without disturbing her or the children. The twins had woken up to the sound of the door slamming shut downstairs.
“Is it Daddy?” Sara looked up with a swollen red face. Strangely there was no fear in her voice. A cold dark chill went down Stacey’s spine. The children think this is normal. Then the knock at the door. Tom’s voice came through the one-inch thick wood. He began apologizing, but she dismissed his voice. They think this is normal. The thought momentarily gripped her in a strangle hold forcing her to dry heave in shock. Tom continued his apologizing and she snapped out of her trance like state just in time to hear him say he would be home from work late and then they would talk about this.
This is how she came to find herself packing like a madwoman, trying for the first time to stand tall against her husband. All day she could not shake the fact that after what that man, the father of her little ones, had done, the children were acting like nothing had happened. She would not let them grow up like that. She would not let them become victims.
There was really no plan. She would head to her mother’s and tell her everything. She needed the space to think and to decide how to take control of her life again.
Outside the howl of the wind was joined by a light flurry of falling snow.
Blood started to pound against Stacey’s ears and she could feel cold beads of sweat forming on her brow, every minute closer to seven made her more nervous, she wanted to be long gone before he came home. She was afraid that she would lose her nerve if he came home and caught her, worse, what would he do? How would he retaliate? Sweaty hands snatched clothes from the dressers and darting eyes scanned the rooms to make sure that she had missed nothing of importance. The children’s clothes and a few favorite toys all ended up askew in a large black garbage bag. The suitcases were bloated with more clothes and a few more of the kids more precious toys.
“Mommy!” The sudden shout snapped Stacy out of the rhythm she’d established, Sara was standing in the doorway with a big smile on her face.
“Can we play?” Sara held out her crayon and grinned. Sparkling blue eyes shone with mirth and just the sweetest dash of mischievousness. They think this is normal.
“Not right now honey, can you play with your sister?”
Sara started to pout, but only for a second.
“Chrissy! Mom says you have to play with me!” The sound of something being dragged along the wall and then another pair of bright blue eyes peered from behind the door frame.
“Play with us Mommy!” Chrissy smiled up at her mother, with a green streak of crayon across her face. Her White teeth always prominent in her big happy smile.
“Mommy wants to play babies, but mommy is really busy right now. But guess what?” The two children looked at each other, “We are going for a car ride.”
“Yeah!” The children cried gleefully “For French fries?!”
“That’s right honeys. You like the car but now you have to play till Mommy is ready to go. Can you play nice for Mommy?” The children nodded quickly and with one look over their shoulders they disappeared down the hall, bouncing away in unison. From the kid’s room Stacey could hear their excited chatter. She cast a quick glance outside the window, beyond the frosted, foggy glass the world had started to turn a deep white.
The town’s oldest and most remote truck diner was almost empty. Steve, the owner was washing the counters and dreaming of getting home. Tonight there was going to be something special on TV that he didn’t want to miss, and it was getting cold, he hated these storms and he just plain detested the cold.
Shivering he looks up as the small chime rings above his door and a familiar face appears in a gust of wet cold wind. The sheriff glances about the diner before entering. Brushing snow off his jacket he orders the usual coffee he takes with him on his rounds. Afterwards Steve goes to pick up the change left on the table in its usual place as the cheap bastard makes his way back towards the exit. Sighing he rolls his eyes. Short a buck twenty-five, the guy had stiffed him and he was supposed to be the law in town.
“Eh, Steve, I asked for the coffee whitener, not this artificial sweetener garbage. You know it gives you cancer, right?”
“Sorry John, none left. I thought ya wouldn’t mind.”
“You know what’s worse than cancer though? This stuff gives me gas and I’m stuck in a truck in this cold all night. You know what that means? It means the windows are rolled up. Why don’t you ever have the coffee whitener?”
“Well I would have to say it’s cause the new help my useless brother hired keeps forgetting he buys the groceries when he’s in a rush to plow yer ‘ol lady.”’
“You’re a real funny guy, Steve. Good thing I don’t lock people up for being so, so funny.”
“Well pardon me, sheriff, I’m just saying it ain’t the roads being the only thing plowed round here tonight, is all.”
“Careful, eh Steve. You’re not just takin the joke too far you’re absolutely murderin’ it. And murder is something I can lock you up for.” The sheriff grins and turns as if to exit the diner.
“Aw, just take your brew and get outta here. Get home before the storm really hits hard.”
“Yup, I hear you. It’s gonna be a real bad one. Best get myself home to the woman, you know how she worries about every little thing.” With that the sheriff tips his hat and offers one more glance at his old friend Steve, “I nearly forgot, best you get the road closed sign turned on pretty quick. It looks like we’re in for a helluva night. I don’t want any cars out there on that road, not tonight. No sense in me goin’ to get them in this weather…”
“I hear ya. I’ll turn the thing on in two minutes.”
“Don’t be messin’ around. Get that sign on.”
“Just get home, I’ll take care of it.”
Two minutes later, Steve, the owner of the last diner on the way out of town saunters into the back room and flips the switch on his outdoor sign, the sign that would have warned vehicles that that road out of town would be closed till further notice. Outside the sign sizzled and crackled to life before shorting out and going dead almost immediately. Steve might have been the world’s best line cook and a great manager of the smallest diner in town but what he was not and never claimed to be was much of a handy man. Being handy was also part of the job description of the dumbass his brother hired.
Outside the dead sign disappeared in a wet coat of sleet and snow.
Six-thirty, and finally the car was packed and ready to go. Extra blankets and clothes were in the back, packed tightly into the small trunk. The girls were strapped into their seats tightly and Stacey took one final look around the house. God forbid she forget something important. Tom was going to be home very soon. Screw it, she thought. On her way out the door she picks up a rock by the outside stairs and with just the briefest moment of hesitation she sends it flying through the large picture window, shattering it into its own storm of glass shards. She allows herself a quick feeling of satisfaction then briskly heads for the car. Maybe Tom would freeze tonight. She could only hope.
The old car finally pulls out of the driveway at exactly six forty-five. The snow beneath her tires makes that satisfying crunching noise and sparkles like powdered glass in the headlights. Already it’s almost too dark to see. What she was doing was right, wasn’t it? It was nearly a six hour drive to her mother’s house. Six hours in the summer, if you obeyed the speed limit. It was going to be a long night. Stacey – mother of two, waitress at the local Burger Heaven, and recently empowered woman pressed down on the gas and escapes with her daughters into the blustery winter night.
“French fries! Mommy, French fries!! We want French fries!” Sara was pulling against her seat belt and Chrissy was fidgeting back and forth in excitement. Stacey in a hurry had forgotten her promise to them.
“Okay babies, we can have some French fries.” The drive-through window at McGreggory’s should still be open at this hour. The weather should still be okay downtown, they wouldn’t be closed quite yet. Best of all she wouldn’t have to stop at the old diner just on the outskirts of town. She didn’t like that place because it was greasy and cheap and they never seemed to have any coffee whitener.
The interior of the car smells of French fries, savory and salty. Reaching down onto the seat beside her she grabs a few of her own and pops them in her mouth. She didn’t realize how hungry she was and now finally away from the house and safe with her little ones she’s able to relax a little. She made it.
The children munched happily on their less than nutritious dinner without a care in the world in the back and Stacey helps herself to a couple more from the bag beside her. With the food in her stomach she was feeling better. The anxious trembling had subsided and she was feeling a lot more confident now in her decision. She takes in the soft misty glow of the streetlights in the falling snow. It had already gotten thicker since the time she had pulled away from the drive through window only moments ago, but she didn’t mind. She had been driving a long time and was used to a little snow. Within 10 minutes she reaches the edge of town and the road out, she glances to her right and smiles. The truck stop was still open and she could see the owner inside through the big windows. There are no other cars in the lot but his. Looking back to the road she focuses her vision ahead. In her review mirror the lights of town slowly dim and finally disappear, lost to the darkness of the evening and falling snow.
Steve looks up from moping the floor. The now empty diner was quiet except for the Coke machine humming in the back. He had seen something outside, just barely though. A vehicle had just passed his place. That can’t be right he thought. Leaning the mop against the counter he heads towards the window. Beyond the lights of the diner there is only an empty darkness. Something didn’t feel right, then it clicks. The sign wasn’t on. There was no light from the sign. Grabbing his coat he rushes out into the parking lot. The snow pelts against his face and sticks to his unkempt beard. He runs with an uncoordinated gait towards the road and slips on a patch of ice.
“Damn it!” Standing back up gingerly, he manages to get his soaked and shivering body out to the road. “Aww God damn it.” he mutters. Down at his feet was a set of tire tracks already being buried in fresh snow. Letting his eyes move up to the dark sign he shakes his head. Stiffed a buck twenty-five and now this. All he wanted to do was go home and watch “Tokyo Night Nurses” in its original uncensored version.
“Could my luck get any worse…?” he mutters. Then, the very cold (how he hates being cold) and pissed off Steve starts his way back into the diner.
In a cozy home on the other side of town a couple were enjoying a little time together when the phone rang. Phil (but he likes to call himself ‘the’ Phillip) jumps up with a start. He looks like a child caught with his fingers (deep) in the cookie jar. Lisa gasped one last time and then reached out for the phone.
“Hello?”
“Yea, it’s Steve. Yer husband round?”
“Uh, no. He shouldn’t be back for another hour. He’s still making rounds.”
“God damn it, again,”
“What’s this all about? You sound even more pissed off than usual.”
“Is Phil there?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Cut the crap. I turned on the sign like yer husband asked. But Phil didn’t do his God damn job cause it ain’t lit and I ain’t taking blame for it. If he’s there tell him to get his ass over here as in pronto.”
“Um, yea. I’ll call him and make sure he gets the message.”
“Do that.”
“Steve, you can get hold of my husband if you call the station. They’ll relay the message over the radio if it’s important.”
“Right, I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.”
“Yeah. Sure.”
“And do me a favor, can you unwrap yer-self from Phil’s dick long enough to tell him that if this sign isn’t fixed within the next hour he’s gonna be looking for new work and a new squeeze toy.” Before Lisa can answer, the dial tone of the now flat lined phone silences her.
“What’s up?” Phil mops away his sweat soaked hair from his eyes.
“Some sign, it’s not working or something.”
“Oh yeah, yup, I was supposed to fix that. But I never got around to it for…” Phil says with a boyish grin, “…obvious reasons.”
“Well… Steve wants you to fix it tonight.”
“Do we have time for one more?” Phil starts towards Lisa. He tries to pull the covers off her naked body.
“Don’t be stupid. Steve’s pissed. Just go make him happy. There’ll be other times.” Phil looks like he’s about to actually pout like a child but only for a second then he does as she says. Heading down stairs he finishes doing up his shirt and then leaves the house of the town sheriff.
High beams try to slice through the darkness. Nearly blinding light is reflected back at Stacey. The snow has really started to fall now, no…that’s wrong, the snow isn’t falling, it’s being dumped by the bucket full. She can feel the wheel jerk against her grip, she fights the car, forcing it to go where she wants it to. Beneath the car’s tires the road has turned to a thick soup of densely thick wet snow and ice threatening to wrench control of the wheel right out of Stacey’s hands.
Hunched over she stares intently out into the night trying to detect even the faintest glimmer of a yellow line on the road but it’s not possible. This how it’s been for the last forty minutes. Twenty minutes ago she stopped singing “A hundred bottles of chocolate milk on the wall” with the twins. Children are highly sensitive to their parent’s mood. They are sitting quietly in the back. Stacey knows they aren’t asleep though. She can hear them passing toys back and forth and quietly giggling. But then the silence is broken.
“Where is Daddy?”
“Yeah, Mommy, where is Daddy? Are we going to see him at Nana’s?” The kids are bored, they finally notice that something is not quite right.
“Daddy has to work. He can’t visit Grandma with us tonight.” She hopes that will be the end of it, she doesn’t want to even think of Tom.
“Can Daddy come tomorrow?” Sara asks.
“Can he visit Grandma, too?” Chrissy follows up.
“I miss Daddy.” One of the twins exclaims. Stacey isn’t exactly sure which one as she’s trying to keep their vehicle firmly on the road.
“Yeah, I miss Daddy and… and I want some cake, Mommy.” That’s Sara, Stacey fed her a Twinkie once when she was three and now she’ll crawl over a mountain of any other kind of junk food for a piece of that ‘cake.’
“Kids, I need you to play the quiet game for a while okay? Can you do that for mommy? Mommy really needs to have quiet to drive okay?”
“If I win, can I have some cake?”
“Yes, Sara, if you win. But you have to be quieter than your sister. And for longer. Can you do that?” There is no answer. The kids know this game really well. Just the promise of cake can keep them in line for an awful long time. Chrissy usually can outlast Sara, but not if there is a Twinkie on the line. Sarah has gone up to forty minutes while Stacey did her housework. Stacey breaths a little sigh of relief. There will be quiet for a little while at least.
Stacey never even has a chance to slow down.
The events unfold for her again and again. A nightmare scene stuck on some angry replaying loop. The French fry meant for Sara had been thrown off target and hit Stacey in the corner of the eye. She had been startled so badly that she lost concentration, but only for a moment. She turns around reflexively to scold Chrissy and that’s enough time for disaster. As she glanced back she caught the animal’s eyes reflecting in her headlights. But they were too close. She doesn’t even slam on the breaks. There’s the sickening sound of the thud of the deer’s body slamming and breaking against the hood of the tiny car and the even worse sound of glass smashing inward towards Stacey’s face as the deer’s head is crushed against her windshield. There’s blood everywhere. The deer’s body is carried up and over the top of the bruised vehicle.
The heavy deer combined with the unforgiving road is too much for the car to remain in control. The wheel pulls out of Stacey’s panicked grip as she instinctively slams down hard on the brakes fighting to regain herself and control of the doomed vehicle.
Within seconds that somehow last a lifetime the car leaves the road, it crashes down the steep embankment on the left side only stopping when it mercilessly smashes into the thick trunk of a tree causing a cascade of dead snow and evergreen branches to splash through the broken windshield and into the front interior of the wreck. When it’s all finally over the entire front end of the tiny car is buried beneath a freezing swamp of thick wet snow, pine needles and splintered wood at the base of a tall evergreen. The tree and its army of brothers all jut towards the sky like frost bitten stalactites cursing at the storm now howling in a rage around them.
There’s crying, somewhere in the distance, there’s something warm in her eyes. Tom? Where was Tom? Where was she? What happened? Something, someone shaking her. Blinking, Stacey’s eyes open fully. She had managed to come to. Chrissy had climbed into the front beside her and was shaking her and crying loudly. Stacey’s head hurt. Reaching up to her forehead she can feel a large gash bleeding profusely. Mixed with her blood is a slew of sharp pine needles stuck to her forehead.
Stacey feels dizzy but awake and more alert by the second. Now she can hear Sara in the back crying in terror. Forgetting about her pain she reaches out for Chrissy and manages to mumble to Sara to come up front. When both children are in the passenger seat she looks them over. Neither seem to be bleeding, but there are already bruises on Sara’s face. Stacey wondered how long she had been out. Thank God for safety belts.
“Mommmmmmy!” Sara’s panicked voice pleading with her.
“Shhh, honey. It’s okay now. We’re okay now.” She pulls Sara’s warm trembling body against her own where she shivers in fear against her chest.
“Mommy, what happened? What happened, mommy?” Chrissy’s confused voice reaches out over Sara’s crying.
“Were okay sweetie, Mommy just had an accident. But we’re okay now. You’re not scared are you?” she tried to use her most confident and relaxed voice. But it cracked. They were in trouble. The engine was dead and the interior lights on the dashboard were dim. She’s afraid that the battery might be dying too. The windshield has a large break in it and there’s water dripping down inside onto the steering wheel and then dripping down onto the mat.
They had made it. They were all alive and with only minor injuries. Now it was up to Stacey to figure out a way to get them out of this.
“Okay kids, let’s get into the back, there’s more room.” The children have stopped crying. Mommy’s in charge and they are only too willing to obey. Quickly, they scramble over the seat and try to get comfortable in back. Stacey tries to move. Sitting up brings a rush of pain to her forehead and sweeping nausea through her body. The wound in her head opens and starts to bleed over the clots it had been trying to form. Opening the glove box she grabs the remainder of the napkins from dinner and presses them against her injury. A moment later the throbbing and nausea subside enough to allow her to take stock of her situation. She’s ready. Climbing gingerly over the seat, she sits down between the kids. They’ll have to share her body heat.
“Mommy?”
“Yes, Chris, baby?”
“I wanna go home now. I don’t wanna see grandma anymore. I wanna go home.”
“Yea mommy, I wanna go home and see daddy.” The children have stopped sniffling and their tears dry on their distressed little faces.
“We can’t right now honeys. We have to stay here for a little while okay? Then we will go home. I promise.” She’s got to take their minds off the situation. She can’t think properly if she has to deal with scared children.
“Hey, I know! Why don’t you tell me, what do you want to be when you are a big person, Chrissy?”
“Chrissy wants to be a fireman, mommy.” Chrissy shoots Sara a glance then sticks out her tongue at her sister.
“Firewoman! And Sara wants to fly to the moon in a spaceship!” Now Chrissy laughs a little. “Daddy says she wants to be an ass-true-nut!”
“I am not a nut!” Now both the children laugh. Not loud or with enthusiasm, but a timid laugh is a start. Stacey smiles a little. Good. Keep them occupied.
“Okay, Chrissy, why do you want to be a firewoman?”
“Sometimes there are kitties who don’t know how to climb and they get stuck in a tree. That’s why! Sometimes kitties see some bird in a nest and then they climb the tree but then they’re too scared to come down… Oh, Mommy, can we have a kitty when we go home?” Sara pulls tight against her mother. She moves her mouth to Stacey’s ear her hot breath tickling her cheek as she speaks.
“Chrissy really wants a kitty for birthday,” she whispers.
“Well, we’ll have to see. Depends on how brave you are and you have to be really, really good right now. Can you do that for mommy?” Chrissy squeals in delight and balls her little hands into fists. Her eyes glaze over as she fantasizes about her own cat to play with.
“How about you? What do you want for your birthday Sara?” Sara looks down for a moment. She has to think about it. But when she looks up, she smiles and her blue eyes light up.
“I wanna Daddy to take us to the zoo again!” Stacey grits her teeth but smiles as she brushes her daughter’s hair from her face. She then turns to look out the window at a world slowly disappearing from view while forcing the smile to remain in place. She tries not to notice how cold it’s become.
John was angry. Very angry. The miserable weather had nearly caused his vehicle to slide into three telephone poles while on his rounds and now…. now he had to go try to track down some crazy person who was headed out of town in this miserable weather. When he got a hold of whoever it was stupid enough to go out on a night like this, well… he was going to do some serious neck ringing. Phil too, he couldn’t wait to get a firm grip on that guy. There would be a new position opening up for a local handyman slash delivery boy. Shit, had to happen on this night too. Of all nights. Lisa had said she wanted to talk to him about something important tonight when he got home. He was pretty darn sure she was caving and going to let him go on that fishing trip with his buddies this spring as long as he was willing to talk babies again. God damn, John had a few words for whoever was out on that road tonight. He was sure he would find them parked somewhere on the side of the road. They couldn’t have gotten far in this weather. But he could do them no good with his cruiser. He had stopped at the station and upgraded to a larger vehicle. Now with his trusty thermos full of re heated, day old coffee and the emergency radio switched on, he steered the large four by four into the full fury of the storm.
Freezing cold. Their bodies are shivering uncontrollably now. The twins had fallen silent about a half hour ago. They were pressed as tightly against her as possible. Their little hands were buried in her clothes pressing against her flesh. Chrissy’s hands were clammy against her skin. But she had to keep them warm. It was so cold. The coats and boots and gloves were doing little against the onslaught of the snow. The car was now completely covered. The inside was one big refrigerator. Stacey was so thirsty. Her throat was dry. She’s fairly certain that she’s lost a lot of blood from her forehead and she’s wondering if she might be going into shock now that her adrenaline rush was over. Twice she had thought of drinking from the pool of collected ice water on the car seat. Two things held her back though. First she was sure she remembered that you don’t let a person going into shock drink. Second she worried that the cold water would suck more energy from her body if she drank it. She needed to conserve energy. Her children needed her heat. But this could not go on for long.
Idiot! She remembered the blankets and extra clothing in the trunk. Why didn’t she think of it earlier, what the Hell was wrong with her (besides maybe being about to pass out)? Feelings of guilt flood her. Of course, there was a first aid kit in the trunk. It had chocolate bars, wrappings and bandages. But most important were the blankets and clothing. They were going to make it. They could outlast the storm and tomorrow, Stacey would head to the road and wave down the snow plow. They would be saved, she just had to get to those blankets.
It was going to be rough though, she would have to fight the storm. The car was buried under snow covered pine branches and she did not know how deep it was on the ground. One wrong step in deep snow could be disaster if she broke her ankle in the twisted pine.
She glanced down at her babies. They were turning pale. Both were too cold now even to complain about being cold. Leaning forward she reached out and grabbed the keys from the ignition. It had to be this way. She lifted Sara over her body and laid her against her sister. They wrapped their arms tightly around one another, but they did not have her heat.  She paused and thought a moment, they needed more. Unzipping her coat she pulled it off her body. It wasn’t a big deal, she was actually starting to feel warm again. Maybe she was amped up for the work she was about to do. She wrapped the coat tightly around the two sleeping twins, they did not protest or even open their eyes. Sara whispered something in her sleep. Chrissy shifted even closer to her sister.
Opening the car door had been more of a fight than Stacey had anticipated. She had pressed her full weight against the side. Just when she thought it was not going to budge it gave a little. Then shifting around she was able to press her feet against its side and push with all her remaining strength. The door opened enough for Stacey to just barely squeeze out. She stepped into thigh high snow. Quickly, she closed the door behind her. Immediately she was assaulted by the angry wind. It bit at her face and attacked her exposed hands and fingers. The wind also moved like an overzealous lover up and under her sweater making the cold she suffered feel all the more encompassing.
She would have to move fast before she went numb and could not move at all. Slowly she plowed her way to the back of the car. All that remained exposed was one corner of the trunk. The rest was covered in at least five inches of snow. Reaching out for purchase she slipped, the ground was uneven and she was swallowed up by the snow. The bitter grip of cold threatened to suck away what little energy she had left. The freezing blanket chewed at her senses. Her skin screamed in agony. Pulling herself up, she felt terribly weak. This was bad. There was blood on the surface of the snow. The wound in her head still open was spilling her life essence out into the white world that threatened to become her tomb. A wave of nausea swam through her body and she heaved.
She vomited onto the snow covered trunk. Her whole body felt dizzy right down into the bone. She was certain she was going to fall over again but she thought of her children in the back seat. She knew if she gave in, she would probably not get up. Bracing her legs against the sturdiness of the cars bumper she gathered her wits. The dizzy spell passed and she was back in control.
First thing she had to do was push all the snow off the trunk so that she could open it. Wrapping her sweater around her left hand she pushed the snow off. It was hard work, her soaked sweater was offering her very little protection. But she managed to wipe enough of the snow away that she would be able to open the trunk. Reaching into her pocket she grabbed the keys. Stacey’s hands were shaking uncontrollably, and it didn’t help that the wind whipped snowflakes were biting at her eyes. She could barely see the keyhole. Shielding her eyes with her left hand she brought the key down. But her hand would not stop shaking. The key would not find its target. It poked at either side of the hole and scratched against the paint. But it would not go in. Stacey started to cry. Frustration overcame her very being. She smashed her left arm down onto the top of the truck.
“GODDAMMIT! YOU BITCH! GET THE HELL IN THERE!” she screamed in desperation. Then, like her orders had been obeyed the key slid into the lock. Triumphantly she turned the key. It would not give. She had been holding the wrong key. In her weakened state she’d mistook one brass colored key for another.
Her stomach heaved again. But this time all that came out of her mouth was a wail of anguish. She pulled the keys out and began to jangle them in front of her swollen eyes. Not that one, not that one, that one! She grabbed the appropriate key. This time. One more try. Let’s get this right. Her fingers were now numb and unresponsive. She moved her hand down to the keyhole again and shielded her eyes with her left arm. Reaching out for the keyhole she tried to steady her hand. The keys slipped from her numb fingers and into the snow.
Horror crossed her face. This was not right. They key was supposed to go into the lock, the lock was supposed to open. Stacey was supposed to get the blankets. Then she was supposed to wrap her children in them and wait till the storm died out. That was what was supposed to happen. Not this.
Stacey was too numb to fight it. She could only muster the energy to reach into the snow and probe around for the keys. But they were nowhere to be found. She dropped to her knees. Tears were streaming down her cheeks and freezing to her skin. Her nose dripped and she started to bawl loudly. Thrashing around in the snow she desperately searched for any sign of the keys. The snow had swallowed them up like tiny delicious morsels. There was just no use. She had failed. She failed herself and she had failed her babies. She just wanted to faint right there. She wanted the snow to cover her up and let her die. Beyond her ears the wind laughed at her.
The girls. Stacey’s left hand reached out and grabbed the top of the trunk. Then her right hand found hold. Snow had already covered the metal again and threatened to make her loose her grip. Stacey was not going to let it. She pulled herself up. She slowly brought herself to her feet again. “Fuck you. It’s not going to be that easy.” She lifted up her right hand and extended her middle finger. She waved it around in the snow. “That’s right! FUCK YOU!” Stacey screamed into the dark void. She was not going to quit now; she had her babies to think about.
It was easier to get back into the car. Stacey had to use her body to pack the snow away from the door. She was beyond feeling, the task was nothing to her now. She couldn’t feel the cold. In only minutes enough snow had been moved to allow her to pull the door open with both hands. She managed to climb back inside and pull the door closed behind her. It shut with a dull creaking sound. The noise startled Chrissy awake. She opened her eyes and looked at her mother.
“Are you a snowman?” she asked in a hoarse whisper.
Stacey looked down at herself. She was covered in snow. Her clothing was soaked and plastered in it. This was not good. She pushed into the driver’s seat and stripped down to her underwear. Her clothing no longer bothered her. But it would mean death to her little ones. She brushed the snow out of her hair with her left hand. That was when she noticed the strange angle her finger pointed. It was dislocated. Probably when she smashed her hand down on the trunk. She couldn’t feel it. Her body was too exhausted to register pain now.
“How you feelin’ honey?”
“Sleepy, mommy. Sleepy and cold.” Chrissy reached out for her mother. Sara’s eyes remained closed. She was in a deep sleep. Probably for the best, though. Stacey moved into the back again. She was still a little wet but didn’t notice. It just wasn’t cold for her anymore, she felt nothing now. She wrapped herself around the children keeping her wet body separate from theirs with her coat. Chrissy ran her tiny fingers through her mother’s hair.
“I wish daddy was here mommy.” Stacey’s limbs felt so heavy.
“I know honey, I’m sorry, baby.” She was so tired, but she tried to grip her children as tightly against her as she could.
“When can we see daddy?”
Stacey never answered, she wouldn’t be answering anymore.
Outside the car, the snow had stopped falling.
John had been driving for two hours. He had been making good time in the large truck. The chained tires ripped at the snow on the road and the engine growled angrily, pissed off to be working so hard in this kind of weather. He had just started to think that the crazy fools weren’t out here when he felt the front tires slam against something hard. The interior contents of the truck went flying everywhere. John’s coffee spilled all over his pants. “God damn” he muttered. Bringing the truck to a stop he paused long enough to decide it was best to go investigate. He climbed out of the truck and stepped down into the road. The snow came up past his boots. It was like glue to him. Wet and thick. He could feel his feet getting colder by the second. Going around back he checked out what caused the thump. Half exposed underneath the carriage of the truck was the mangled remains of a large deer. He gripped the front legs in his gloved hands and pulled. It was smashed but more important it was frozen. John’s vehicle had not done this. Somebody else had hit this deer.
The snow had stopped falling so he was able to have a good look around. Pulling out his flashlight he scanned into the distance. Then, as if to offer sympathetic aid, the full moon came out from behind the curtain of storm clouds. It was over. The storm had passed. The night was fully illuminated. The scent of pine trees wafted through the air as their creaking snow covered branches gently allowed light dusts of snow to fall from them.  It was the quietest and most peaceful scene he had ever witnessed. Good enough for a Christmas card, he thought.
Only a moment later John found something that ruined that sense of peace. He had flashed his light down a steep embankment where he saw something that caused him to shiver. Buried deeply in the snow except for the back end was what looked like a small car. Damn fools. Why tonight? He wanted to slide down there and check for survivors but he knew what to do first.
Sheriff John Buick made his way back to the truck and radioed in for help. He was going to need a plow and tow truck. Also he was going to need help getting himself and anyone else back up the embankment. He couldn’t wait. He grabbed the radio from its case and attached it to his belt. From the back he grabbed two emergency blankets and his thermos of hot coffee. If he got trapped down there till help came it would be fine. But he needed to get to whoever was in that car.
Sliding down the embankment on his now soaked ass, didn’t improve his disposition. The car seemed too quiet. He looked at it. There was something odd. The snow at the back had been disturbed. There it was at the side too. Maybe an animal? He was not too sure. But the snow was definitely not dispersed the same. Then something caught his eye in the light. On the bumper half exposed something was glittering. He reached out and brushed the snow away. There caught on a sharp corner was a set of car keys. Now what the hell are those doing there? John’s radio clicked to life startling him. He nearly dropped the keys. Instead he pressed the button on his radio.
“John here, what’s up? Got that help coming?”
“Yea boss. What you find out there?”
“Car.”
“How is everyone?”
“Lemme check. Out.” John pushed his way through the deep snow. It was cold. He could feel the warmth slowly being leached from his body. Grabbing the door handle he pulled hard. With a slow painful groan that echoed deep into the surrounding woods, the door opened. Hopeful, John slowly bent over and glanced inside.
Jesus, Mary mother of God. It was Stacey and the kids. John knew them, they were Tom’s family. He and Tom had worked some cases in court together. John had been to their house for dinner, good family. Stacey was looking at him, her eyes unblinking. Frozen red tears from the wound in her head stained her face and her naked skin. She was cradling her two children in her arms. The twins, what were their names again? Christen and Sara? That’s right. The children looked like they had been wrapped in their mother’s coat. He glanced around the inside of the car. On the front seat driver’s side was a set of frozen clothes. Stacey’s. The passenger seat had French fries all over it. The glove compartment was open. The back seat had the family. On the floor more French fries and napkins. He reached down and picked something up. It was this thing that made his lower lip heavy then tremble. In his big gloved hand was a tiny green Crayola crayon.
John paused for a moment to collect himself then slowly reaching out to Stacey he tenderly brushed her eyes shut. The twins’ thank God were already closed. He’d seen scenes like this before… but this was the first time with young children.
“Hey, boss, you there? Everyone okay?” John heard the radio but he did not answer.
“Boss? You there, boss?” John opened his eyes and wiped his nose on the back of his hand, then grabs his radio.
“Bill, no survivors. Come and get me quick.” He moved out of the back of the car. He still had Stacey’s keys in his hand. Why had she left the car? He pushed his way back to the trunk. Sweeping it clean with his arm he tried the different keys and finally found the right one. The trunk popped open. There inside was a suitcase, a couple of packed garbage bags and an assortment of blankets. These things could have saved them.
“Daddy?” John looked up startled.
“Daddy?” He had heard it. The faintest whisper, but it was there. Pushing his way back to the car door he swung it open. One of the twins’ eyes were open. She was moving, but just barely. Her voice was low. Just a whisper. If the night had not been so quiet he would never have heard her.
“Hey there, honey,” he whispered. She slowly turns her head to look at him. Her skin is so pale. She is nearly gone. Quickly he climbs into the car and pulls the door closed behind him.
“You’re not daddy…”
“No… no, but I’m his good friend. Do you remember me? I’m Uncle Johnny.” He grips her body close to his and reaches out for the other little one, hope starting to build… but within seconds it’s dashed.
“I want my daddy…”
“I know. Don’t you worry though, we’re going to take good care of you and get you back home to him, okay?”  The child blinks her eyes slowly and nods her head in approval. She turns to look at her sister while John clicks on the radio.
“Get here now, we’ve got a survivor.”
“Really… that’s…” John doesn’t pay attention to the rest, the little one has turned back to him and is speaking again in her soft, exhausted but matter of fact voice.
“I change my mind… I wanna be a firewoman, too. Me and Chrissy, we can help kitties together.” Sara sighs softly and rests her head against John’s chest. He nods and tells her she can be anything she wants as he gently strokes her hair trying to comfort her and maybe himself.
Outside, snow begins to softly, ever so softly, fall."	9.79	14.0	Devin Langan	04/11/2020
Did You Hear the Ice Cream Man Last Night?	"I used to think of Hell as a faraway place.

For those of you out there who still hold that belief, this piece of my life is for you. Don’t ask me why I’m doing this; I’m honestly not sure. My therapist says writing about our traumas can help our brains cope—make things easier to swallow, a system he affectionately refers to as “remedy-writing.” My reasoning could be something as selfish as that. Perhaps I’m also hoping that those of you who read this will heed its warning. Do not make the same mistakes my ten-year-old self did. Or maybe it is merely the adage: misery loves company.

I grew up in a middle-class suburb in Ventura County, not too far from Los Angeles. Our house was one of many cookie-cutter homes separated by white pickets or chain link fences.

My mom, a soft-spoken, dream-driven woman, worked from home as an editor for a growing magazine. My father spent every day in Simi Valley where he worked as a cargo loader for trucks. After a day of lifting, managing the forklift, and meeting every physical demand, he’d come home sore and irritable.

I remember eagerly staring at the clock, watching it tick revoltingly slower every time I checked. Then came the magical chime that sounded our freedom. Summer break had started, and school finally released us from our desk-shackles. I think I miss that most about childhood—the raw, unfettered excitement I had for things. The sort of overwhelming avidity that kept you awake at night just waiting to look underneath the Christmas tree, just waiting to see your birthday cake, just waiting for a brand-new day. We eventually lose it as adults, once the day-to-day exhaustion and cynicism set in.

With summer came many things that have permanently crystallized in my memories: The smell of backyard barbeques, the giddy laughter of kids running through sprinklers while their parents gossip on the porch, the golden bar of sunset slowly sinking down the street, and of course, how could we forget the ballad of a summer heatwave, the ice cream man’s jingle. That was how it all started.

It was on a warm Wednesday night. An awful gnawing hunger pulled me out of sleep. Unable to ignore it, I slipped out of bed and crept past my parent’s bedroom. I was craving something sweet from the kitchen. Settling on the last of our pudding cups, I also poured myself a small glass of milk. It would be enough to shut my stomach up. As I started back to my room, a faint sound caught my ear.

A song, like the one you’d hear drifting out of a music box, was coming from outside. I walked to the window and peered through it. The muffled tune, more specifically, “Pop Goes the Weasel” was coming from down the street—an ice cream truck.

I’d never seen Mr. Mason out this late before. He was one of the residents of our neighborhood, who decked out his grey van to sell frozen treats. But he usually started his route at noon, when the sun was at its cruelest. Maybe it’s for the adults, my ten year-old-brain thought.

The truck coasted by my house, moving tantalizingly slow with that happy electronic chime. It wasn’t Mr. Mason’s van. The truck was a pale green with blue accents on the lower half. On the side of its metal body was a large circle with the print of a cartoonish boy in the center. He had blue skin, big black eyes, and a white soft-serve hairstyle. His pupils were notched to create the illusion of a glare on his smiling loony tune face. One of his white-gloved hands held a Fudgsicle to his mouth while the other gave a big thumbs-up. The tip of the swollen thumb, as well as the fingers and wrist, appeared to be melting, just like ice cream. Written above and below the circle, in sizable whimsical lettering:

PIPER’S POPSICLES

JOIN THE FUN

That next morning is still such a vivid memory to me. I remember waking up to my father’s fist pounding against my door. He was yelling, ordering me to unlock it. I pulled the bed sheets over my head and curled into a ball. Even now, I can still feel that sharp tinge of anxiety just thinking about it. Then from behind the doorframe, a countdown started from three. You never wanted him to reach zero. God help you if that man ever reached zero.

When I opened the door, he snatched my arm and pulled me into the kitchen. My bare feet dragged pitifully across the floor. The white milk jug was sitting on the corner, its cap still missing. Mom was sitting at the table, her neck deliberately facing the window. Not a good sign.

“Did you leave this out?” he asked with a sotto voice.

When I didn’t give an immediate answer, he twisted my arm. A hot ring of pain coiled around the area. “Yes!” I cried out. “I’m sorry! I left it out! I’m sorry!”

“Great!” His voice rose and cracked. “Now we need more milk. What a fucking waste.” With one of his hands still clasped around my arm, he reached for the milk jug with the other and dumped it over my head.

My mom gasped loudly in her seat, the trademark reaction.

He left for work after that. Evidently, I had made him late. It wasn’t the first of my father’s outbursts, and it was far from the last. The bastard was always looking for a punching bag, and when my mother didn’t fit the role, I was runner-up. Every day in that house was like maneuvering around trip wires. Eventually, you’d trigger him.

My mom scooped me off the floor and took me to the bathroom so I could wash the milk out of my hair. She left a bundle of clean clothes on my bed. That was her time to react: The moment our front door slammed shut and his car left the driveway. Until then, her neck was twisted anywhere else with that same disconnected, faraway look. When I came back into the kitchen, she was making eggs for breakfast.

“What kept you up last night?” she quietly asked me.

“I was hungry. I was going to put everything back, but the ice cream truck distracted me.”

She looked at me quizzically, the blistering hot oil popping in the pan. “What do you mean?”

“He was driving around the neighborhood last night. Didn’t you hear his music?”

She scrunched her forehead and shook her head. “Mr. Mason wouldn’t be driving around that late; there wouldn’t be any point to it. All he would get is no customers and noise complaints. The sweets you ate before bed probably made you dream about it.”

If only that were the case.

That night, my stomach once again woke me. The hunger pangs had come back much worse this time. As much as I tossed and turned, trying my best to ignore it, but it was impossible. I sighed and pulled myself out of bed, once again tiptoeing past my parent’s bedroom. The kitchen had nothing for me, not even milk now. My mom still hadn’t been to the store that week, leaving our pantry mostly vacant, save for larger meals. I wanted something sweet.

Then it came again, the melodious music from outside. The ice cream truck was driving its late-night route again. Another sharp twinge stabbed at my stomach. The thought of ice cream at that moment was captivating. If the driver were following the same pattern as last night, he’d pass right by here, right? The idea teased me. I weighed my options. The piggy bank in my room had at least two or three dollars of change in its gut. I could run out, pay him, grab the ice cream, and run back with my folks none the wiser. But if my father noticed—dear God if he saw, I’d have a lot more than hunger pains to fall asleep to. I stood there and pondered. Eventually, hunger won the debate.

I went into my room and opened up my piggy-bank. The mechanical jingle was getting closer; it was nearly passing the yard. I put on my shoes and wrapped a jacket over my pajamas. Carefully, I unlocked the front door, praying that the click wouldn’t be too loud. I discreetly pulled it open, just enough for my small self to slip through. Luckily, not enough for the hinges to creak.

I ran across the grass and down the driveway in my sneakers. There it was, steering slowly toward me. The song churning out of the speakers situated at its top sounded similar to “It’s a Small World.” It pulled up and stopped near me. The cartoon caricature with bright blue skin, presumably named Piper, smiled down at me.

Behind the hum of its engine, I heard something suddenly clink inside of the truck. The music stopped, and someone hoisted open the vendor window. I tried to look inside, but there wasn’t a single light or bulb to light up the interior; it was just a metal box of darkness.

“Hello?” I called out.

“Hey, little guy.” The cheery voice that answered was soft and mellow, definitely not Mr. Mason’s smoker’s rasp. “What can I get for you?”

I shuffled the quarters in my palm. “Can I have a Bomb Pop?”

“You sure can!” the chipper voice answered. Inside the shadows, there were vague signs of movement and quiet humming. The sweet-smelling aromas of hot fudge mixed with other milky flavors created an amalgam of smells that made my stomach growl.

A white-gloved hand melted out of the blackness. Tweezed between its index finger and thumb was my popsicle still in its wrapper. I took it and held my hand full of quarters out to the serving window.

“Oh, no, no, no,” the man said. “Not necessary. This one is on me, free of charge.”

I smiled and pocketed the coins. “Thank you!” I beamed and cocked my head to the side. “Can you see anything in there?”

“I see everything,” the voice chortled. “Where are your friends?”

I scuffed the curb with one of my soles. “They’re probably all asleep. Everyone is. Why do you drive around so late?”

“Well, I was born sick, you see, the type of sick that makes me sensitive to the sun. If even the slightest bit touches me, I’d whistle, I’d whizz and then I’d FWOOMP like a firework!”

We both laughed at that. From within the lightless interior, I could make out a vague face with perked smiling cheeks.

“Would you like another popsicle?” he asked.

I itched the back of my neck. “I should go now. If my Dad sees me out here, I’ll get in trouble.”

“Oh.” He sounded disappointed. “We wouldn’t want that. Drop by again, okay? Bring some friends next time!”

“I will.” I smiled and waved as I carried my free popsicle back to the house. The door quietly closed behind me; my parents didn’t hear a thing. On my way back to my room, I peered out the window. The Ice Cream Truck was still out there, sitting motionless in front of my house. Finally, the wheels started turning, and the music began a new chorus of “Home on the Range.”

I ate the tri-colored popsicle in my room. The flavor that tingled over my tongue was like nothing I had ever experienced. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that words will not do it justice, but I’ll do my best. It was a beautiful mixture of cherry, lime, raspberry and something else, something different. It was like a literal rocket had propelled itself through my system and left a sputtering trail of joy. Each bite only brought me to a higher atmosphere. It was fantastic, enjoyable, and worst of all, unnatural. I slept like a baby that night with a more than satisfied stomach.

The next day I biked around our neighborhood with a few. We had chosen a miserably hot day for it and quickly regretted the decision. Luckily, we found a large tree and sat with our bikes in its cool shadow.

“Have you guys heard it too, the ice cream truck at night?” I asked everyone.

They shook their heads, trading off skeptical looks at me, except for one boy: Matthew. He was pudgy, wore a pair of square-lensed glasses that complemented his round face, and had cheeks splattered with freckles. We weren’t close friends but mostly knew each other from school.

“I’ve seen it, parked right outside my house,” was his tepid response. “The guy waved at me from the window. I thought it would wake my mom up, but she slept like a boulder.”

Before I could answer him, it was as though the devil himself had heard our chatter, and we heard the music. Mr. Mason’s ice cream van rounded the corner, blasting the first few bars of its tinny melody. That was just what we needed right now, the perfect solution for a brutal summer day. Ever since the Bomb Pop from last night, I’d been craving another. My thoughts kept returning to it, the lingering flavors still flickering in my mouth. I was almost drooling. I wanted more.

Mr. Mason quickly spotted us and pulled up with a smile. He spoke in a grizzled, unique voice, which I now realize was a thick Turkish accent. I handed him the change in my pocket and waited for the wondrous rocket-shaped popsicle. The moment I grasped it, I immediately tore the wrapper off and sunk my teeth into it. Then, just as quickly, I stopped and gagged. It was bitter, like I had just taken a bite out of frozen wax. The taste covered my tongue and clawed the back of my throat.

I let each of my friends have a lick, except for Matthew who immediately declined. They all said it tasted normal, not sharp or waxy at all. My friend who had asked for the same thing even let me try his. It was horrible, absolutely horrible.

None of them could taste it, the disgusting flavor.

I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling and shaking. The pulsing red numbers next to my bed read two in the morning. My eyes were red and swollen from hours of crying. Pain lanced the purple, pear-shaped bruise on my leg. A reminder, courtesy of my father, that after a grueling day of work he did not deserve to come home to a bike left in the driveway. It would, unfortunately, be another nine years of this before the untreated blood clot in his leg would take his life. A few days before the accident, I had told him to go fuck himself.

But my father wasn’t the reason I couldn’t stop shaking; it was the cravings. The throbbing spasms of hunger had been haunting me for the past few nights. They were back with a twisting vengeance, worse than ever. After Mr. Mason had given me the popsicle, I’d spent the rest of the day trying to get rid of that vile taste. Nothing was working; in fact, every sweet thing I tried tasted just as bad. Even my favorite juice was developing a sharp, greasy aftertaste. I bit deeply into my knuckles, a nervous habit I’d acquired over the years, which has now left a row of callused depressions there. I needed something sweet; I’d have killed for something sweet.

Then it returned, the music outside my window. Just down the street, the late-night ice cream truck was making its rounds. That was it, the answer to my prayers. Without thinking, I sprang out of bed and grabbed my jacket and sneakers. Slipping out of the house was just as easy as the first time. Mostly fueled by hunger, I ran to meet the truck halfway.

It rolled to a stop, clearly spotting me. Not that I was hard to miss, of course. I ran next to its minty green body and impatiently waited. But nothing happened.

“Hey Kiddo,” the voice said through the open passenger window. “Sorry about that, my hatch is stuck and won’t open. What can I get for you?”

“Another Bomb Pop—please?” I asked pitifully. Hiding the pleading whine in my voice was impossible.

“Not a problem, let’s have a look-see.” I could hear him rummaging around, muttering incoherently to himself. He returned, sounding less than cheerful. “Well, that isn’t good.”

My heart sank like an anchor. “What isn’t?”

“It looks like I’m out of those for the night. Dang, what bad luck.”

A painful throb racked my stomach, making me wince. “Something else,” I begged. “Can I have something else?”

He rummaged around some more and sighed heavily. “I’m sorry to say, but it looks like I have nothing left.”

Tears rushed to my eyes. Hopelessness bubbled up inside me. My solution, the one sure thing I needed to get rid of these cravings, was gone. I’d have to wait until tomorrow night. I started the miserable walk home, back to the bed I knew I wouldn’t be able to fall asleep in. My sneakers dragged along the asphalt.

“Hang on a tad,” the voice said. “Looks like I have one more left, just for you.”

I whipped back around and raced to the passenger window. “Really?” I said, wiping the trailing tears from my face.

“Of course.” I heard something unlock—the passenger door. “I found it right up here, come get it.”

A chorus of alarmed voices called out to my brain: Not safe, this is a stranger, go home, not safe. Of course, there were red flags, obvious ones. But I was not thinking clearly. My logic had whittled away. All that mattered was the craving—the unusual desire for that exquisite taste. It possessed me. I knew there were risks, but my fatigued boyish mind was done compromising.

I pulled the green metal door open. The cabin was expectantly as dark as its backside. An invisible coldness permeated the air, about as cold as you’d presume an ice cream truck to be. The tart, dancing smells of chocolate, strawberry, bubblegum, and other flavors graced my nose. A single grated step led inside. I spied a vague silhouette sitting at the driver’s seat with my Bomb-Pop in hand.

“Go on, it’s all yours,” he said pleasantly.

I leaned inside the truck, planting one foot over the metallic step while the other remained on the pavement. The dim outline of the driver held out the popsicle, just inches from my fingers.

“Come on,” he said again. “Don’t you want it?”

Just as my fingertip grazed the foil casing, I heard something. Something that without a doubt saved my life that night. A strained voice squeaked out of the truck’s insides.

Help me.

The hand holding the popsicle lunged at me, seizing my arm as I tried to pull back, grabbing a handful of sleeve instead of skin. I gasped, too shocked to muster a scream, and jerked backward. But his grip was relentless. The darkness around us dispersed, and in an instant, I could see everything, like some veil, had lifted.

A nauseating texture coated the ceiling, rust perhaps. It crawled down the inner walls in a reddish-brown crust. There were scuff marks on the stained floor. A foul eggy smell thickened the air. Every window was impossible to see through, smeared with grime and networking cracks. But the worst of all, the crux of my persistent nightmares even now, was the thing in the driver’s seat.

A naked, bluish body mottled with dark rashes and boils. Folds of excess skin sagged off of its bloated frame, almost like it was melting. One of its long double-jointed arms was pulling at my sleeve. The loose flesh that hung off of it wobbled and jiggled like sacs of trapped liquid. And then its face, the horrible, horrible face was creased with a clownish smile. Its gums were grey and infected with bent teeth jutting out of them. It looked bald at first glance, but a few straggly white hairs sprouted from its swollen blue scalp. One of its eyes, a pitch-black sphere, was rooted in its cheek, like it had slid down from the socket. The only thing remotely human about the thing was the way it sat in the driver’s seat. One ugly hand on the steering wheel, the other still trying to pull me closer. A guttural voice spat out of its mouth at a sickeningly cheery octave.

“Don’t you want it, little guy?”

I screamed and didn’t stop screaming. The sanity drained out of me in fat seeping tears. My vision was a wet, blurry haze of horror and internal voices screamed for me to run-run-run-run. Suddenly, something was ripping. I flung myself back onto the asphalt. My sleeve was now a bloodless gash of torn fabric. The nude, humanoid thing was exerting a strange huffing, gurgling sound—maybe laughter, I don’t care to know for sure.

The outside of the truck was even worse than the inside. Eating away at the pale green paint was a thick film of black matter. It covered the car in a black, muddy ooze, smothering the cartoonish boy and his broad smile. A few letters did show through though: JOIN THE FUN. Parts of the grimy substance were moving, throbbing maybe, as though they had some sort of pulse.

The speakers atop its mucky body, although caked in the stuff, were still spewing out sound. It wasn’t music, not in any way that the human mind could understand. A hollow, high-pitched frequency with a gravelly white noise hiss. Behind the corrupted pitch was something else, something that almost sounded like it was trying to escape from it—choppy inaudible screaming. Hell, I was hearing Hell.

With the last burst of adrenaline my system had to offer, I twisted around and tore through the yard to reach my house. I flung the door open, slammed it shut, and slid down to the floor. I buried my head in the crevice of my knees, drenched in snot and tears.

I sat there wallowing for some time, waiting for my father’s footsteps to come pounding out of his room. But it never happened. Both of my parents were still in bed. I tried to wake my mother up and out of pure desperation, my father too, but neither so much as stirred. The gritty white noise was still screaming from the street. I hid beneath my sheets and covered my ears, trying everything I could to expel it from my head. Help me; the distressed voice had said from the back of the truck, the voice that saved my life.

Finally, after minutes of grueling torture, the truck revved its engine and cruised down the street. The house became silent, save for my sleepless crying.

A child did go missing that night. Matthew, the boy with freckled cheeks and square lenses. I will not be giving out his last name for respect of the family. His parents had woken up to his empty room and their front door left ajar. They called the police and filed a missing person’s report, and the community was notified about the disappearance. I remember seeing a few police cruisers lined outside of Mr. Mason’s house, probably because the boy’s mother heard him spout off about an ice cream truck coming in the dead of night. They found no evidence against him, but the grey ice cream van didn’t leave his garage for the rest of the summer, or any summer after that.

To this day, I can still feel those bitter flavors in my mouth, sitting on my tongue like a pool of chemicals. At first, it only affected sweet things, then salty things, and slowly worked its way up to everything. No matter what I eat, no matter what I drink, my stomach attempts to force it out of my body due to its acrid waxiness. I take no pleasure in food. I eat only not to die. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed something as simple as taste.

Every night a new wave of impulses come back, prying at the last cardboard walls of my sanity. I cram my knuckles into my teeth to trap the screams inside. I beg the dark nothingness of my room for something sweet. That’s how it draws you out: Hunger. When the happy, inviting music gets in your head, it fills you with cravings masquerading as hunger. Don’t bother trying to wake your parents; it won’t work. Not while that truck is in your neighborhood. Then you take the bait, the incredible flavor from your dreams, a taste so perfect you’d kill for a sliver of it again. But when you go back, begging for just one more, it takes you.

So, I implore you, whether or not you decide to believe me after reading this, at least give it some thought. If you are ever stirred awake in the dead of night, and an ice cream truck’s jingle drifts in from the window, go back to sleep. For the love of God, go back to sleep."	9.84	25.0	Michael Paige	04/10/2020
The Smell	"It was on the third day of the stench permeating the house that we decided to call the landlord. In the last month since we had moved in, there had been a lot of creaking and groaning from underneath the house. It was built sometime in the ‘30s so the noise just added to the creepy atmosphere – I kind of liked it. But considering the age, we figured the plumbing must have gone bad from expanding and contracting in the heat of summer. We hoped that the problem wouldn’t be extensive. Our landlord was punctual and told us to expect the plumber by 8 AM the next day.
The temperature in Palmdale was pushing 110° that week. While intolerable, it wasn’t breaking any records for the southern Californian desert. The temperature was notable this late in September though; usually by this time of the year, the heat would have broken, but it had been the hottest summer in recent years. Because the house was so old, there wasn’t any central air conditioning. Instead, the owner had opted for smaller built-in AC units. They didn’t make the house much cooler until the sun went down, but it was cheaper than central air. We had lived in the Antelope Valley our whole lives. It wasn’t the best place to grow up, but it was home. The town had deteriorated in the last ten years and there had been an influx of homeless and vagrants in the area lately, but the price was a steal and we couldn’t turn it down.
When we moved in, I had placed a plank of wood over the opening to the crawl space to keep the dogs from venturing underneath the house. Every couple of days, when I would walk past the side of the house, I would notice the plank had been knocked over. We had two small dogs — it was odd to think that they were able to knock the plank down, though I had seen them do stranger things. After a few weeks, I was tired of putting the plank back up, so I had placed some boulders I found in the desert in front of the wood to reinforce it. It seemed to hold up –  I couldn’t see the dogs being able to get past the boulders. Later on in the evening, we saw the dogs pawing and growling at the barrier. We laughed and joked how they were mad about not being able to get under the house. It had been almost a week, and I felt proud of my makeshift barrier. When I went to the side of the house to dismantle the facade for the plumber, I noticed there was a small hole just big enough for our dogs to fit through. Right underneath the boulders and plank; those damn dogs were resilient. I removed the wood and was assaulted by a wave of humid, fetid air. “Good lord, it smells like death under there,” said the plumber. I offered him an ice-cold bottle of water from the fridge. “Thanks.” You couldn’t pay me enough to go down there with that rancid stench.
We sat in the living room while the plumber worked. We wore the least we could get away with; windows open, fans on high-speed. I was kicking myself for not investing in a window-mounted swamp cooler like Dad had suggested. Ashley mentioned she was hungry and I cracked a joke about her eating the rest of my leftover veal Parmesan from the restaurant from last week. She swore she hadn’t touched it, but I knew she had a habit of picking at my food. I let it go. We hadn’t been shopping for groceries in a few days, so we made a plan to go after the plumber was done. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too hot by then. Whatever food we still had needed to be cooked, but to cook meant to turn the oven on, and even at 8 AM, it was too hot to cook – not to mention the smell didn’t give us much of an appetite.
“Jesus Christ!”
We heard the muffled panic through the thin wooden floor of the family room. I ran from the living room towards the back door and saw the plumber through the window stumbling from the side of the house in a panic, covered in filth, trying to regain his composure. I opened the door and stood in the doorway, anxious to hear how severe the problem was. He climbed the three steps to the patio towards me.
“What happened?” I asked.
“We need to call the cops!” he said.
“What do you mean?”
He hesitated for a moment.
“There’s a body underneath your house! That’s what you’re smelling! This isn’t a plumbing issue, this is a hazmat issue! Do you have any idea how they got under there?”
* * * * * *
When the police arrived, they cordoned off the house, but wouldn’t let us leave. After their initial investigation, they confirmed that the body was in advanced stages of decomposition, though the coroner estimated that they had been dead for no more than a couple days. The time of death didn’t match the putrefied state of the body. We sat in the family room with the dogs. They licked our hands as we rubbed them for emotional comfort, waiting for the police to question us. They didn’t mention it, but I knew the police saw us as persons of interest based off the questions they asked : How old was he? What was his name? Did we know who he was?
We didn’t know.
They left after finding that our story couldn’t corroborate any suspicion of foul-play. We stayed with Ashley’s parents who lived in town while the house was being sanitized by the hazmat team. No more than a week had passed before the coroners had finished their report. They identified the man as Jesus Paez, 66. The Police confirmed his identity as one of the local homeless. The coroner mentioned that his body had bits of flesh missing at various locations. Hyperthermia was the cause of death; he must have crawled under the house and the heat killed him. They suspect that he had been living underneath the house for a while and either fell asleep or became trapped there as the temperature rose.
I thought about the plank of wood and the boulders I set up, and it all came together.
The noises.
The missing food.
The smell."	9.23	13.0	Chris Bertman	04/06/2020
Camper Appreciation	"“Come on, Jim, you know it’s going to suck.”
I didn’t nod, though I wanted to.  Mark was right, as usual.  Most of camp had sucked, to be honest.
Tom, on the other hand, tried once more to be the voice of reason, even as he tugged up his shorts and kicked at a rock on the ground.  “Guys, we’re going to get in trouble.  Everyone else is going.”
Mark sighed and adjusted his glasses.  “Just because everyone’s doing it doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.  Didn’t you see that old movie where everyone on board the airplane eats the fish and they all get sick?”
As we looked up at the big “Camper Appreciation Night” banner above the cafeteria door, I decided then and there we would ditch.  Not like we’d miss much.  A couple of songs, some pats on the back, the “Hope-pache Awards,” which everyone was pretty sure were insensitive to somebody, somewhere.
In fact, the only good thing about camp at all was the reason we were ditching.  “Yeah, Mark, let’s do it.”
“My man!” Mark slapped me on the back, a big wide, stupid grin on his face.  “Even if it turns out to be nothing special, at least we had an adventure.  That’s what camp’s all about, right?”
Camp Quiet Ridge had not been an adventure, to say the least.  Oh, sure, me, Mark and Tom had always had fun at our old camp, Camp Bendix Point, but it had closed that year thanks to a lice infestation.  Luckily (that “luckily” in gigantic, sarcastic, hipster air quotes), an old camp, refurbished and under new management, got a hold of the Bendix Point mailing list and suddenly every parent in the tri-county area was thanking their lucky stars that their rugrats had something to do that summer.
The director, Barry, seemed like a nice enough guy, but after the first day rained out the archery competition and it was discovered that most of the canoes had been ruined by a squirrel, things went downhill from there.  The nature hikes were slow and nobody saw any cool animals, the crafts weren’t anything to write home about, and the counselors were all bored.  To top it all off, during the week somebody had smashed up the windows in the cafeteria.  They were never caught, but plywood had to be put up.  Thankfully the lights inside worked… most of the time.
Seeing how his whole effort was going down the drain, Barry decided to cancel that upcoming Thursday’s wallet making session to invite the whole place down by the lake to hear him tell ghost stories.  It seemed like a long shot, but by that point, pretty much everyone in the place felt so bad for him that we all obliged.
We didn’t need to worry.  He was good.  Really good.  Some of his stuff really did make our skin crawl, and a few times I looked out over the lake to the woods on the far side, imagining ghosts and goblins lurking out in the woods, watching us.
The tale that got to me the most, though, was one he told about a family, which had camped out there many years ago, that had mysteriously disappeared.  A young man, his wife and their two children were warned that there was a murderer that lived out in the woods, but they didn’t listen.  The killer lived in an old house, built by a logger at the turn of the century, and they set up camp far too close to his home.  Then, one night, while they slept, he came upon their tent, and with a few fell swoops of an axe, he killed every last one of them.  He then feasted on the remains and buried them up in his shack.
I recall Barry finished his cautionary tale with a totally unnecessary warning: “So don’t go out into the woods alone, because the killer might be out there.  He could be anywhere…even…HERE!”  Then he jumped at a couple of campers, who screamed with delight.
The story sounded like total crap.  Ever since the slasher movies of the 80s, every camp has some story about some murderer roaming the woods; at this point they’re practically mascots.  Heck, even Bendix Point had the legend of Ol’ Charley, a hermit who chased bad little kids with a chainsaw in hand and a bag over his head.
The thing is…there was a house.  At least, that’s what Mark said.  He had wandered off on Tuesday while our bunkhouse was trying to put together a papier-mâché totem pole in the activity center up in the hills, and he saw a small little house, barely bigger than a hut, hiding up a little ways in the woods.  He didn’t think much of it at the time; only when he heard the story did he put two and two together.
Now, none of us believed for a second that we’d find a bunch of dead bodies up in that house.  But the three of us were the curious type; something like that was just too good a deal to pass up.  It was away from camp, probably abandoned, and we figured we’d have a ton of fun digging through trash to see if we could find anything to take home.  At that point, somebody’s old junk was better than any of the crap we had made that whole week at camp.  My leather wallet, for instance, looked more like a foot than anything I could keep money in.
Besides, we wouldn’t be gone all night… we’d be back before anyone called on a search.  And if they did, so what?  Considering our phonebook sized permanent records at school, it’s not like we weren’t used to getting into trouble.  Tom was the best among us, but he still did whatever we told him to do.
“I still don’t know…”
I rolled my eyes.  “Tom, if you don’t come with us, I’m putting a snake in your underwear before we go.”
“There’s no snakes in these woods.”
“I’ll buy one.”
“Geez, all right!”
See?  Did whatever we said.
Mark led the way.  We had just reached the edge of the camp center when we heard whistling, and saw Barry walking around outside the mess hall.  We ducked low, and watched him as he went over to the main doors, looking around as if to make sure everyone was safely in, and pulled the latches on the doors so they could shut.
I did feel a little twinge of guilt.  I really couldn’t help but feel bad for the guy.  He kind of reminded me of what Tom might have looked like when got older…a little chunky, balding a bit under that cap of his, but always smiling and friendly, even if a little gullible and naive.  Still, the lure of adventure won out, and Mark whispered for us to go.  Barry wasn’t paying attention anyway… he was fumbling in his pocket for keys or something.
We skirted up into the hills, back up to the activity center.  It was slow-going, being uphill, and we had to hold up for Tom once or twice, as he wasn’t exactly in the kind of shape required for most summer camps.  Once we’d made it to the top, Mark pointed up into the pine trees.
“Up there.  As soon as you break the treeline, you can see it.  Probably take five minutes to get there.”
I smiled.  “Awesome.  Let’s go.”
We waited a moment.  Mark shifted his weight.  “You go first.”
“You brought us here.  You go.”
“I told you we shouldn’t have come.”
We both turned to Tom.  “Shut up, Tom!”
An owl hooted.  Great.  We hadn’t seen anything other than a few squirrels and songbirds that year up to that point. Of course, the wildlife picked the worst possible time to show up, just as we started to get cold feet.
I decided we wouldn’t get anywhere unless someone stepped up, and if that wasn’t going to be Mark, it certainly wasn’t going to be Tom, either.  “All right, fine. I’ll go first.”
Up until that point, we had relied on the moonlight to lead us, but once we stepped into the trees it got dark.  Really dark.  Like “locked in the closet by my older brother when I was 6” dark.  I got out my little penlight from the pack of camping accessories my parents got me on my first day of camp and pointed it up the hill, shining it around looking for the house.
It took a little while to find it, but once my beam landed on it, there was no mistaking it.  It looked like a place a logger would have built, with mostly wooden walls, but somebody who was clearly not a logger had added a crummy side room onto the place.  At one time or another it appeared to have been painted white, and its windows were busted out; its door hung loosely upon its hinges. I remember thinking at the time that it was way more awesome than “Camper Appreciation Night.”
I climbed up, with Mark following closely behind, and Tom stumbling his way after the both of us, until we reached the door, and I pushed it open.
Inside, the place was a wreck.  Busted, useless furniture filled nearly every corner.  Old tin cans, rusted and forgotten, covered a large portion of the floor.  The mess continued on through an open doorway to an old kitchen, with a busted gas stove and an on old latching refrigerator, the type mothers always say never to play with.  There’d been no power to them, obviously, but it was still a wonderland of garbage to sift through. And that’s when I saw something metallic gleaming, partially obscured by the dirt and leaves littering the kitchen floor.  I brushed the remaining dirt away and found a handle.
“Holy crap.  Guys, look.”
Tom came over first, and his eyes widened.  “Is that…”
I nodded, and pulled it hard.  A square of the floor rose up, revealing a small, dirty crawlspace, and pure darkness beyond.
Tom gasped.  “You think there’s…”
“Of course not.  There’s no dead body under here.”  But even I couldn’t believe my own words.  What if some psycho really had been living up in these woods and buried some bodies in here?  It certainly looked possible.
“Mark.  Mark, come over here and…”
I looked behind me and saw that Mark was still in the main room, bent over and thoroughly examining something.  He was turning it over in his hands.  I left the trap door open and went over to see what he was doing.
“What is that?”
When Mark looked up at me, his pale, shaken expression was enough to put me ill at ease.  But then I saw the source of his concern for myself.
In his hands was a pair of binoculars – modern ones – only slightly scuffed and dirty, where hands had been touching them.
“Where did you find those?”
Mark pointed below the broken window.  I had overlooked that pile while investigating the kitchen, but it now had our full attention, and it was obvious in an instant that the things we were seeing shouldn’t have been in that house.  We saw cans that were not only in pristine condition, but sealed. Beside a pile of old, tattered blankets was a modern sleeping bag.
I looked out the window.  Most of the outside was unobservable in the darkness, but there was a small spot where the moonlight made it possible to get a glimpse of our surroundings.  Taking the binoculars from Mark, I looked out at that point.  It wasn’t much, but I could see the center of camp and the cafeteria from there.  It was far off, but clear enough that, in the daytime, I would have been able to see a lot.
Then something moved in front of the light.  I lowered the binoculars, and I saw a shape amidst the blackness, its outline visible thanks to a small light it was carrying, which was pointed to the ground. It looked a bit like a flashlight beam, though it was covered, presumably to keep others from seeing it. For several moments I stared trancelike at the wandering stranger, until the sudden sound of approaching footsteps startled me, breaking the silence.
“Oh, crap!”  I whispered, dropping the binoculars. I grabbed Mark.  “Someone’s coming!”
Mark froze, his earlier resolve to ditch camp seemingly gone.  I grabbed his arm and looked for a rear exit.
There wasn’t one.  There was no door out to the back.  And all the windows faced the front. Apparently loggers were not known for following fire escape standards.
“Guys!  Here!”
Tom waved to the trap door.  I had my second thoughts, to be sure – the crawlspace wasn’t exactly inviting – but I wasn’t weighing many options.  Whoever – or whatever – was coming towards us was definitely not a camp counselor, and my mind conjured up nothing but images of chainsaws, knives, and the thought of us all skinned and hanging from the rooftop flooded my mind.  With those images flashing through my head, we really had no choice.  I pulled Mark towards the trap door and dropped in.  Tom came in after us and pulled it shut.
It was quiet upstairs for a few moments.  It was dry and dusty, and I could feel cobwebs all over.  I wasn’t sure if there were spiders still living in them, but I still felt light prickles going up and down my skin.
The front door opened.  We held our breath as footsteps trumped back and forth in the next room, followed by a short, sharp yell.  There was a thunk sound, and a can went scurrying across the floor.
Oh, no, I thought. He must’ve noticed his stuff was touched.  Through the darkness, Tom reached for me and grabbed me by the shoulder, squeezing tightly.  Normally I would have elbowed him as hard as possible, but right then I didn’t mind in the least.
The footsteps shuffled around a little, and we watched in horror as the beam of the covered light danced through the gaps in the floorboards, until at last the intruder stopped in the kitchen… directly over the spot where we were hiding.
The light shone over the trap door.  The same trap door we had recently unearthed.
As the light passed over the three of us, we tried to duck down as low as we could, moving as little as possible, and holding our breath.  But in a moment, the light caught his face, and I saw who had been living in the house.
It was a man, older than my dad, maybe in his 50s, if I could even guess.  He was dirty, with brown streaks smudging his face, but while I normally imagined homeless guys as having long beards, crazy unkempt hair and even crazier eyes, this man only had a few days’ worth of stubble and short hair with a few flecks of gray.  His eyes, though, were constantly moving, as if something was always darting around in front of him.  They were also wide, practically bulging out of his head, like he was genuinely scared that something was in the room with him.
And then he shone the light right between the boards.  The brightness of the beam forced me to blink and avert my gaze as my pupils dilated abruptly. And in that moment, his eyes stopped darting around.
Tom and Mark didn’t move, didn’t breathe, even.  But none of that helped when I saw the smile slowly start to cross the man’s face.
I waited for him to fling open the trap door and yank us all out and tie us up, ready to put us on a spit.  But instead, he went over and grabbed the stove, and with a horrible squealing noise he positioned it over the top of the trap door.  Once the dragging stopped, the man trudged into the other room, leaving us alone in the dark. Tom began whimpering. Meanwhile, I put my eye as close to the floorboards as I could, and I stared in silence.
Courtesy of what little light the old man’s dim flashlight offered, I watched him rummage through his pile of things. A moment later he found what he was searching for: a long object with one end larger and fatter than the other.  When he hoisted his light again, I saw it was an axe.
My blood stopped circulating.  A darkness greater than that of the crawlspace seemed to envelop me, and the world appeared to swirl.
I awoke a short time later, to the sight of Tom before me, slapping me repeatedly.
“Jim!  Wake up!  You fainted!”
I sat up.  “What?  What happened?”
I heard something click, and my penlight came on.  Tom swung it under his face.
“He left.  I don’t know where he went, but he’s not here.”
I rubbed my face, and noticed my hands were shaking.  We weren’t dead… not yet, anyway.  “Where’s Mark?”
Tom shone the light on Mark, who was balled up and rocking back and forth.  On the one hand, I didn’t blame him for freaking out.  But I did want to crawl over and slap him for getting us into this.
I pushed at the trap door, but the stove now blocking our way had to weigh more than the three of us combined; we weren’t getting out that way.
“So, what now?”
Tom shook his head.  “I don’t know.  But there’s got to be something.  Here, take the light and look.”
The crawlspace was incredibly gross.  No matter where I directed the beam of my light, I discovered old cobwebs, debris, and even the bones of squirrels and rats that had gotten stuck over the years, a sight that didn’t exactly boost my confidence.  There were no spaces around the edge we could crawl through; where there wasn’t raw earth, there was stone foundation.  If we wanted to dig our way out, we’d have a very hard time doing it.
I turned my attention to the floor above us.  In certain places, the dirt was so thick that it completely blocked our view of the house above. Regardless, I tested each and every one of the boards I could reach.
It was near the old refrigerator, near the rear of the space, where I found our first and only possible means of escape.  Perhaps the ceiling had a leak at one time, but for whatever reason the wood there was really soft, and when I scraped it with my fingernail, bits of it flaked off.
“Get over here!” I called out.
Tom came right away, but Mark had to be coaxed.  I told everyone we needed to get on our backs and kick as hard as we could.  Tom and Mark agreed to give it a try, as we had no other options. The first collective kick merely shook the floor, but the second strike elicited a loud crunching noise as part of the floor splintered. I would have jumped for joy if I’d been able to. A third followed, producing more cracks, and then a fourth, fifth, and a sixth…
Ten kicks later, the floorboards were in their death throes, and with a final push outwards and upwards, they finally gave way.  I wasted no time.  I clambered up through the hole, wholly unconcerned about splinters and scrapes.  I didn’t care.  We were free, and cuts were the least of our worries.
I helped Tom and Mark out, and we bolted out the front door with abandon. We took off down the hill, yelling and screaming our heads off, hoping someone from camp would hear us.
As we entered the campgrounds and ran past the nurse’s station, our collective instincts kicked in and we came to a halt, and stood silently.  Something was wrong.  Looking around, we noticed that the camp was only barely lit.  No one had come to help us, or even stepped out of a building to see what all the noise was about.
The camp was deserted.
The only place that was still lit was the cafeteria.  We ran up to it and tried the front door. It didn’t budge, but something on it rattled.  In my haste to try to get in, I had failed to notice the large metal chain, visible in the moonlight, that had been padlocked into place around the handles.
We went door to door, and found the exact same thing over and over again: chains and padlocks.  Only the final door was accessible. It had obviously been secured like the others at some point, but someone must have really wanted to get in. What remained of its chains was in pieces on the ground.  I hesitated before I opened the door.
We found ourselves in a back hall that led to several different doors.  The closest opened into the kitchen… again, empty, and again, not what we should’ve seen on Camper Appreciation Night.  The lights were on, though, and it felt safer than the back hallway.  The only other exit from the kitchen was through the double doors that led into the cafeteria itself.  We listened intensely for a moment, but heard nothing to suggest we had company.
I pushed against the doors.  Something was blocking them, but whatever the obstruction was, it began to give way as I applied more pressure.  I mustered all the strength I had and shoved as hard as I could… and to this day I wish I had left that door shut.
The scene before me was one that will stay with me the rest of my life.  The hall was soaked in blood, from top to bottom.  Bodies lay at grotesque angles, covering the entire floor.  We found all of the tables overturned and splintered.  There were deep gashes in the plywood window frames, accompanied by streaks of blood and fragments of broken fingernails.  Limbs dangled from the rafters.
It was an absolute slaughterhouse.  The whole camp must have been in there, every last man, woman, child and bored teenage counselor.  All in pieces.  Pieces with the flesh ripped right off their bones.
I scrambled backwards and shut the door.  That was when we heard the scream.  The unholy, awful scream.  It came from the back hallway.
I ran towards it.  Everything told me to run away, but a small part of me needed an explanation for the carnage I’d just seen. Tom and Mark, wide-eyed and trembling, stood and stared as I sprinted in the direction of the sound.  I thought I heard them calling out to me, demanding I come back.  I didn’t listen.
The sound had come from the head office.  I yanked open the door, and there, pushing me back into the hallway, was the hobo.
He held me with his right hand, and he looked me right in the eyes.  I looked away… and realized why he wasn’t using his left hand.  His whole left arm was gone, raggedly torn away.
His grip loosened, and he collapsed on the floor.
I then heard noises coming from the office, a series of wheezing, gurgling grunts.  I was drawn forward; I couldn’t resist even if I had wanted to.  I felt as if the nightmare wouldn’t end until I knew what was happening, and who was responsible.
Something round and pulsating poked up from behind the main desk.  I went around it, and saw the shape was the stretched stomach of some… thing.  I tried to get a good lock at its face, but couldn’t see much due to fact that an axe had been buried deep within it.  It appeared to be… melting.  Puddling like a candle into carpeting, and leaving behind a rotten stench.  Holes began to appear in its impossibly large stomach, and I could see fingers… shoes…
It had…eaten everyone.  The whole camp.  Everyone but the three of us.
No.  Not it.  Him.
Even without seeing its face, I recognized the worn baseball cap of Barry, still perched on its head.
The rest was a blur.  Tom called the police.  They came.  They comforted us as best they could.  What had remained of Barry was gone, leaving behind only the cannibalized remains of the people he’d failed to fully digest.
I led the police to the hut where the now dead man with the axe had come from.  They ran prints on his remaining arm.  They blamed him for all the deaths.
Everyone’s parents were informed.  Our own parents hugged us tight, wailing and weeping tears of joy that we had not been among the victims.  The three of us – Tom, Mark and I – never went to camp again… though ironically, I ended up seeing a lot of counselors.
The police did find a match for the fingerprints.  Forty years ago, a 12-year-old boy by the name of Jeremiah had been found in the woods, unable to speak.  No one knew what happened to his family… from what the police could put together, they had all gone camping near Quiet Ridge, but their campsite was found empty.  As the boy wouldn’t speak to anyone, let alone testify, the authorities assumed the worst. However, no bodies or evidence of foul play was ever found.
Jeremiah spent years in halfway homes, never saying a word to anyone.  He wasn’t violent, or mean-spirited, but he had never operated at a level that suggested he could take care of himself, and ultimately he was confined to the Newbridge Retreat Facility.  He’d been there ever since, until, believe it or not, the same Wednesday that my friends and I were at Camp Quiet Ridge. That night, without warning, and to the dismay of his caretakers, he left.  A crumpled flier for the camp, which been hastily torn from a bulletin board in the visitors’ area, was later found in his room.
I saw the flier.  It had a picture of Barry’s smiling face on it.  I know because the same one had been sent to our house.  When police showed us other pictures of Barry, they looked nothing like the Barry we knew.  We had never known the real Barry at all, just whatever had pretended to be him all that time.  My guess is that whatever was responsible for the massacre at camp had dealt with Barry just before Camp Quiet Ridge opened, and no one was the wiser.  Suddenly the broken canoes, the broken and boarded-up windows, and the warning urging us to never leave the camp grounds made sense. The events of Camper Appreciation Night hadn’t been done on a whim; they’d been planned for some time.
I could only imagine what Jeremiah had gone through, keeping his knowledge of the beast a secret for forty years.  Whatever his reasons for keeping quiet until the end, I now have my own secrets, and I intend to keep mine. The last remaining knowledge of what Barry truly was will be buried with me someday.  But what exactly he was, I still don’t know.  I don’t want to know.  And thanks to Jeremiah, who sacrificed himself in his efforts to destroy it and save our lives, I hope I never will.
In the end, the man we had figured for a crazed madman trying to kill us was, in fact, an unlikely hero, keeping us safe in his own strange way.  More ironically, Tom, Mark and I – who as kids couldn’t keep out of trouble – are alive today because we disobeyed camp rules.
If there’s a moral in this, I don’t know what it is.  It doesn’t seem like we should’ve survived what became known as the “Massacre at Quiet Ridge.”  I still have nightmares.  Mark’s are the worst. Tom, thankfully, is doing okay.  In fact, ever since then, we let him make most of the decisions now.  Essentially, we’ve all recovered, as much as one can, I suppose, and we’ve moved on, graduated, gotten jobs, settled down and raised families. We should consider ourselves lucky.
But there is one lingering thought that still remains.  I always think back to that day, to what Barry really was, and can’t help but wonder if he was the only one of his kind. I hope and pray there were no others.  I’m not about to go on some adventure to find out.  I’m no hero.  These days I try to stay as far away from the woods as possible.  This means that all of you – and your children – are on your own.
If you’re going to camp, or you’re considering sending your kids to one, and you hear rumor of a “Camper Appreciation Night,” watch out. You may find that the camp director’s idea of appreciation is far, far different than your own."	9.57	14.0	Seth Paul	04/02/2020
Some Shooting Stars Aren’t Meant To Be Wished Upon	"There it was. A fragment of the universe, hurtling through the cosmos. And there I was, gazing up from the comfort of a farmhouse rooftop, built by my father’s hands smack dab in the middle of nowhere. In all the years we lived out there in the countryside, not a damned thing remarkable ever happened. This meteor shower was the highlight of my entire life, and that’s why, with a bit of wonder glazed over my eyes, I wished on that one shooting star, brighter than the rest. I wished for some excitement.
Almost as if an answer to my plea, the meteor took a U-turn and fell from the sky like a falcon diving for its prey. I watched, astonished, as it passed overhead and crashed into the wooded area behind my dad’s property. Surprisingly, there was no sound, no explosion; just the rustling of tree leaves as it plummeted through the forest’s canopy. To make matters more peculiar, I swear I could see a red glow emanating from the crash site, however faint.
After the initial shock wore off, I climbed down from the roof and raced into the woods as fast as my scrawny legs would allow. I had a rough idea of where the thing landed, so I darted in that direction, hoping I could take home a chunk of space rock as a souvenir to show my father. If I was lucky, it would be a treasure thrilling enough to keep him from getting mad that I went off into the woods by my lonesome. I could only hope.
Eventually, I came to a small clearing where the moonlight gently caressed the earth, granting me a somewhat clearer picture of the flora and fauna around me. I noticed many small animals, frantically scurrying north for no discernible reason. I surmised that the meteor’s landing frightened the wildlife nearby, and so I decided to head off in the opposite direction.
Sure enough, after maybe ten more minutes of my impromptu hike through the wilderness, I came upon the source of the mysterious red glow I’d seen before. It was no meteor. There, sitting in a small depression in the ground, was a metallic pod of sorts, complete with a blinking beacon protruding from its surface like an antenna. The craft itself was spherical and at least twice my height. I’d never seen anything like it before. I was utterly dumbfounded.
Before I could take a closer look, a hatch opened up from its side, startling me back into the woods. With a racing heart, I scuttled behind the nearest tree. I cautiously positioned my head around the trunk and spied on the object with bated breath. I didn’t know what to expect; was it some kind of top-secret military weapon? Or perhaps a remote-controlled gadget built by a genius hermit living nearby? Would a little green man step out to greet me, demanding to speak with my leader? No matter the outcome, my eyes were glued to that metallic pod, for better or for worse.
A dark violet ooze spilled from the object, forming a large puddle at its base. The slimy substance then scaled the pod, coating the exterior from top to bottom. As the slime moved around the sphere, the light above stopped blinking. All at once, the purple liquid was repelled from the craft and back onto the ground below. There, it began taking on a more humanoid shape.
As the ooze changed, so too did its color. It became white and fuzzy, not unlike television static. Appropriately enough, TV and radio dialogue soon filled the forest. This thing was collecting signals from thin air, regurgitating lines from popular programs long since broadcast. At least, that’s what it appeared to be doing.
My mouth agape in awe, I began leaning forward without realizing it. The signals ceased abruptly, and I fell, head-first, onto a pile of dead branches, creating a loud crunch. From my new vantage point, I watched the white figure turn in my direction. I then heard it speak.
“Who’s there?”
Its voice was shaky and unnatural; a low, monotone growl coupled with a harsh reverb.
Scared for my life, I picked myself up and ran back home, faster than I had ever run before. I reclaimed my perch on the roof and carefully surveyed the property. Once I was sure I hadn’t been followed, I hopped through my bedroom window and climbed into bed, hoping that I dreamed the whole thing up; an adventure concocted by my imagination, running wild. I wished it were that simple, but wishful thinking rarely plays out in one’s favor.
The following day, I came downstairs to the familiar aroma of eggs and bacon. My father always cooked up a hearty breakfast on Sundays. The sight I was greeted with upon entering the dining room, however, was anything but familiar. There, sitting at the table across from my father, was a man in a clean-cut suit, wearing a bowler hat and a striped tie. We rarely entertained visitors, so I was more than a little perplexed.
“Son! This is Mr. Grovewood. His car broke down a couple of miles up the road, so he’s going to be staying with us for a few nights, just until he can get things sorted out.”
“How do you do, sport?”
I remained silent, perturbed by the man’s presence and still shaken from the previous night.
“He’s paying us a generous sum to stay here, so you best treat him with respect.”
My dad glared at me in a way that effectively relayed his meaning. As such, I complied.
“I’m well, sir. Thank you for asking.”
The man smiled, albeit awkwardly, and I ran off outside to tend to the farm. I didn’t know why, but I’d suddenly lost my appetite. Something just wasn’t adding up. How did this stranger find the farm after his car broke down? We were literally surrounded by forest. Dumb luck, perhaps? Doubtful. I was beginning to feel that his appearance the day after that thing landed in the woods wasn’t a mere coincidence, but this wasn’t a theory I had enough nerve to explore. After all, I had already convinced myself that the previous night’s events were nothing more than a bad dream. The man would be gone in a few days either way, so I tried not to dwell on it.
The next couple of nights were… bizarre. Mr. Grovewood attempted to watch a sitcom with us while eating dinner, but his reactions were less than normal. He seemed confused by the program and would only laugh after he noticed us laughing. And this wasn’t just any laughter, mind you – it was a loud guffaw of intensely uncomfortable proportions. I was almost relieved when he got pulled away by a phone call from a ‘business colleague’, though I didn’t hear a single word exchanged.
The following night, I walked downstairs to the kitchen for a glass of milk, only to find Mr. Grovewood chowing down on a raw steak from the freezer. I asked him about it, and all he said was, “It’s just a little midnight snack. Trust me; a little color does the body good.” Needless to say, I ran back to my room in a hurry, without my glass of milk.
Last night, however, is when I became truly afraid. Walking past the guest room to get to the bathroom, I overheard Mr. Grovewood on the phone. This time, I heard him speak.
MR. GROVEWOOD: Did you receive the information I transmitted?
PHONE: …
MR. GROVEWOOD: Yes, this is the language we must use from here on out. We must avoid suspicion and blend in with the rest.
PHONE: …
MR. GROVEWOOD: It’s a lovely place. Rich in minerals, water, and lifeforms. You and the others are going to like it here.
PHONE: …
MR. GROVEWOOD: So long as you’re ready. There’s no going back from here. This will be our new home.
PHONE: …
MR. GROVEWOOD: No need. Why waste the material on transports when I can beam you down instantaneously? I have two vessels here, ripe for the taking."	8.55	11.0	Christopher Maxim	03/29/2020
Spring Flu	"The spring flu was been going around the school like usual, but some people were sicker than normal. They didn’t just have fever and headache – their faces were blotchy, their eyes bulged, and they all wheezed like they’d just run up 10 flights of stairs without stopping. Cara McCormack was the first one who was really serious, though. I had the pleasure of being in bio with her when she opened her mouth to answer a question, but vomited a fountain of blood instead.
She was only the first. Pretty soon classes were being constantly interrupted by students turning ashen and sprinting out the door, trying to make it to the bathroom before everything came up. The nurse’s office was flooded with wheezing, puking, fainting patients in a matter of hours. Of course, this being 1991, we didn’t have the option of calling parents to pick us up – going to the nurse was the only option. We didn’t know yet the nurses’ calls to the outside weren’t going through, and at that point no one cared, because halfway through lunch, someone walked into the boys’ bathroom and found Paul Maschhoff lying dead in a puddle of blood and vomit. Unsurprisingly, all hell broke loose.
The panic was indescribable. All pretenses of having classes stopped. Teachers herded us into the gym, but it was impossible to get 700 terrified teenagers to sit quietly when their friends could be dying. Meanwhile, people were still getting sick. I remember gingerly patting someone’s back as she wheezed and tried to catch a breath, imagining that I could see plague germs crawling on her sweater, up my arm, and swarming over my skin. I jerked my hand away, and immediately felt terrible for being so callous.
Just then, a handful of teachers filed back into the gym, wearing lab coats borrowed from the science department. The makeshift masks that covered their mouths and noses transformed them from teachers we’d known for years into nameless robots. They corralled us into lines and called students up one by one. After a hasty examination – no stethoscopes, no thermometers, just a quick once-over – kids were sent outside, or to the back of the gym. In, out, in, in, in, out, out, out. They were separating us, sick from healthy.
As I drew closer to the front of the line, I suddenly felt a hand squeeze mine and practically jumped out of my skin.
“Chill out, it’s just me,” a voice whispered. I relaxed slightly at the sight of my best friend Katie, but her pinched, worried face had me concerned all over again. “Are you sick?” she asked nervously, her eyes searching my face.
“I don’t think so,” I said, realizing that I hadn’t even stopped to think about that all day. I ran through a mental checklist: Chills? No. Fever? No. Wheezing? No. Uncontrollable vomiting? Obviously not. “I guess I’m safe for now. How are you? Are you – ”
“Next!” a masked teacher barked, beckoning me up to the front of the line. I meekly stepped up and opened my mouth as instructed. “Auditorium,” he said brusquely, checking something off on his clipboard.
“Why are we going to –” I began, but he cut me off without meeting my eyes.
“Auditorium, now!”
I slinked off and tried to wait for Katie, but another teacher snapped at me to move along. I stopped and gaped at him. It was my physics teacher, Mr. Claeys, who had seen me every single day for two years, and now he wouldn’t even look at me.
“Mr. Claeys? What’s going on?” I asked, immediately embarrassed by how squeaky and terrified my voice came out. “Why aren’t we being sent home? Where are the sick kids going? Why –”
“I can’t tell you anything. Just get to the auditorium,” he snapped. I gaped at him. What the hell was going on?
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Katie emerge from the doors, and I felt weak with relief. At least we were still together. We hustled off to the auditorium, where groups of students were huddled together, glancing around wildly every time someone entered the room, looking for their friends. Masked teachers stood around the walls and hushed us every time someone spoke.
I grabbed Katie’s arm and steered her into a row of seats far from the teachers.
“Katie, something’s wrong,” I began, whispering as quietly as possible.
“Did you just notice?!” she snapped hysterically. “Or is this a normal occurrence for you? People dying in the middle of the school day?”
“No, obviously – I mean, something’s wrong with the teachers. Why aren’t they letting us out? They should be sending us home or at least bringing doctors in here, but they’re cooping us up with other sick kids. Do our parents know? What’s happening? We have no way of knowing what’s going on!”
Her eyes widened in horror. “Well… they have us separated? So we should be okay, right?”
“For how long?” I whispered back. “Yeah, we’re separated, but we’ve all been exposed. Just you wait, pretty soon someone in the “healthy” room with us is going to start spewing. We can’t stay away from it. Katie, we’re all going to get it, we’re all going to die! We need to get out of here!”
“Quiet down, now!” a voice barked. I hadn’t even realized that my voice was escalating in panic. The room started to swirl and I couldn’t slow down my breathing. Oh my god, was I getting sick? I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die! my brain was screaming.
“Emily, you need to calm the hell down,” Katie said. “Come on, breathe. In and out. In and out. We’re going to be fine, we’re going to get out of here and everything will be okay.”
I nodded weakly and put my head between my knees. Breathe in, breathe out. Katie rubbed my back gently.
“Everything will be okay,” she murmured again.
She was wrong.
Kids in the auditorium with us started getting sick, just like I predicted. It started with heavy wheezing as they struggled to get air into their lungs. Their faces turned pasty and blotchy, and they shivered violently like leaves in a high wind. Friends of the sick kids tried to shield them from the teachers, but they couldn’t hide the inevitable vomit and blood. Teachers grabbed the sick ones by the elbows and marched them out – to where, we didn’t know. Katie and I huddled in a corner. At some point I realized I was crying, but couldn’t remember when I had started.
I don’t know how long we were in that auditorium – it felt but years, but was probably just a few hours – before the vice principal poked her head in and beckoned for the teachers to go outside. Everyone looked around at each other nervously, afraid to talk for fear that the teachers would come back in and scream at us. But they didn’t come back. Finally, one senior boy stood up.
“I’m going out,” he said, voice shaking. “We’re right by the front doors, we can get out. Come on, who’s with me? This is insane!”
We were all frozen on the spot. He stared us down until finally a few others slowly stood and walked to the doors to join him. They peeked out the doors and quietly tiptoed out into the hall. The rest of us sat in terrified silence, waiting… and then there was a scream.
“THE DOORS ARE LOCKED! WE CAN’T GET OUT!”
It was a match that lit us on fire. Suddenly we weren’t frozen to the spot and silent anymore – we leaped over chairs and ran out of the room to the massive glass doors. Hysteria took over. Kids were banging on the doors, screaming, throwing heavy objects at them, but the thick glass wouldn’t give.
Oh my god, we were all going to die! What was happening?! I had to be dreaming. This wasn’t possible. The teachers had locked us in here!
Someone shouted a warning as a group of teachers rounded the corner. Katie seized my hand, and we took off at a dead run. Kids fanned out all over the school trying to escape. We banged on every door, but to no avail – they were locked and blocked off. I saw Mr. Claeys running full-tilt towards us, so I panicked and dragged Katie into the first open classroom I saw, and we piled chairs against the door to keep him out.
Then, breathing heavily, we turned around.
Bodies were stacked everywhere.
My head reeled and I almost blacked out. There were so many – at least 15 kids – and I know some of them. There was Lily, and Danny, and Jennifer, and that girl who sat beside me in calculus and copied my homework… oh my god, they were all dead. They were dead. They were dead. I couldn’t stop repeating the phrase in my mind.
A high-pitched noise was building louder and louder. It took me a minute to realize it was Katie, screaming her lungs out. I lunged at her and slapped her, shocking her into silence.
“Pull it together,” I hissed, acutely aware that I myself was far from pulled together.
“I CAN’T,” she yelled hysterically. “I just came to school today and like usual and now I’m going to die – we’re all going to die – we’re all going to die in a puddle of our own blood while the teachers lock us in! What the HELL is going on? What’s happening? Why is this happening?” She crumpled to the ground and sobbed.
Somehow, seeing her fall apart gave me a steely resolve. One of us had to stay sane, and for now it was going to be me. I jerked her roughly to her feet.
“Come on, we’re getting out of here,” I ordered. There was no way we were going to hide in a room full of bodies – I’d find somewhere else to wait while we figured out a plan. We crept out the door and tiptoed down the hall to the next classroom. I pulled the handle and flung myself inside.
Bodies everywhere, covered in blood. The stench was already setting in. All of their eyes were open.
Next classroom. More dead kids. They were everywhere, and I lost count of how many were dead. This plague, or whatever it was, was moving fast. How many people were left alive? I finally slumped to the floor in the third classroom we entered, trying not to look at the bodies. My inner strength drained out rapidly, and I gave into tears.
Suddenly, Katie hushed me. “Listen,” she whispered, pressing her ear against the door.
Out in the hall, I could hear two teachers’ voices. I thought I could tell that one of them was Mr. Claeys. I didn’t recognize the other one. She was weeping and her voice cracked on every word.
“Why is this happening?” she choked out. “Why can’t we get out? Who’s doing this to us? I can’t do this anymore, I can’t see any more kids die!”
I stared at Katie. Maybe… maybe the teachers weren’t the ones locking us in. Maybe it was someone else. But why couldn’t they do something about it? They could call 911, and the police could get us out of here! Before I could even open my mouth to whisper to Katie, Mr. Claeys answered my question.
“I don’t know, and the phone lines are dead. I don’t know what’s going on. We’ve lost control of the students. We can’t separate them anymore, and there are so many dying. They’re – I’m – we’re just going to have to…” his voice trailed off incoherently, and he started hyperventilating. Great, now the teachers were losing it too.
We heard footsteps as Mr. Claeys and the other teacher walked away, and then silence. Katie and I fell into a stupor, our heads still leaning against the door. We sat like that until the sky darkened.
Katie stirred slightly. “Our parents will be wondering about us by now,” she murmured. “Or people who have to go to work, or something. They’ll all be late. Someone will find us, right?”
I couldn’t answer. Nothing made sense.
It occurred to me that I desperately had to use the bathroom. Somehow, biological needs didn’t go away amid terror. Katie and I edged down the hallway quietly, heading for the bathroom, but we didn’t even need to bother – no one was around, and the school was silent as the grave. Which was fitting, of course. We wandered the halls in a daze, looking for signs of life, but there were none. Were we the last ones alive? I couldn’t believe the thought. Surely this disease hadn’t killed over 700 people in one day.
We fell asleep in a supply closet – the one place that was free of rotting bodies. I faded in and out of nightmares, listening to Katie’s rhythmic breathing.
Suddenly, I jerked out of my half-slumber. Something was wrong. Katie’s breathing was no longer regular and even – she was gasping for air, as though her throat was slowly closing in on itself. I stared at her in horror and she stared back, starting to shake with chills.
“No, oh my god, no, this can’t be happening, not you too!” I gabbled breathlessly. Not Katie too. Hadn’t enough people died? I prayed to any god that might be out there to rescue us, but no one came. We were all alone.
I watched Katie’s terrified face transform into red and white patches and felt her skin radiate heat. I held her tightly as she shook uncontrollably, teeth chattering so much that she couldn’t speak. Not Katie, not Katie, not Katie, please God… not Katie… Her rasping breath grew louder and louder, and something in her face changed, like she could see death coming for her.
“Emily, please – ” she started to say, but I never found out what she wanted, because the next thing I knew, she was retching blood all over me.
Have you ever held your dying best friend in your arms and watched the light leave her eyes?
Have you ever screamed and sobbed to an empty universe when you felt her heart stop beating?
Have you sat there for hours and felt her skin cool?
I don’t remember how long I was there before the SWAT team came. I don’t know who alerted them or how they got in. I remember wandering the school in a daze, the only living person in a mausoleum.
I do remember being in the hospital for a very long time. I remember not speaking for months. I remember the police and the social workers sitting me down and explaining that one of the biology teachers apparently had a secret lab in his home and had cooked up this virus. No one knew why. No one had ever suspected something like that coming from him.
It didn’t matter. You might be surprised, but I never looked into the case file or found out more about what happened. Nothing mattered. In one day, I had lost everyone. At 16 years old, I knew the horror of staring at body after body of my friends and teachers, until I was utterly numb to the sight. And I have spent the rest of my life wondering why I alone lived.
Even after more than 20 years, when spring flu season comes around, I see one sick person and I’m instantly back at high school, covered in the blood of my dead best friend."	9.0	14.0	Emily Thurtithrea	12/28/2019
The Elf on the Shelf	"Growing up, or at least since the mid-two thousands, my house always had an Elf on the Shelf during the Christmas season. If you don’t know, Elves on the Shelf are these little elf dolls that are supposed to be scouts for Santa Claus. I named mine Humble. I think I was trying to name him Humboldt but got the words confused, though I’ve long forgotten why I wanted to name him Humboldt in the first place. Anyway, starting every Thanksgiving, my parents would stick Humble somewhere he could practice his domestic espionage, and at night he would head back to the North Pole to snitch on me to Santa. He always flew back before dawn, always hiding someplace new, and each morning was like a miniature Easter egg hunt to find him.
Of course, it was my parents who moved the damn thing every night. I guess I have some mixed feelings about the tradition. On the one hand, it was fun and magical, but on the other, it’s a pretty aggressive expansion on the practice of using Santa to keep your kids in line. I’ve also heard people say it normalizes government and corporate surveillance, but in the age of Alexa and Google, that’s a bit of a moot point.
But I think the weirdest thing about the Elf on the Shelf is how I was never allowed to touch the doll. I could talk to him, tell him what I wanted Santa to bring me for Christmas and all that, but touching him might drain him of his magic and keep him from returning to the North Pole where he belonged. Here’s the actual line from the storybook that comes with the doll.
“There’s only one rule that you have to follow, so I will come back and be here tomorrow: Please do not touch me. My magic might go, and Santa won’t hear all I’ve seen or I know.”
Obviously, the taboo against touching the doll makes it harder for a kid to conceive that it’s actually their parents moving it around – or worse, testing that hypothesis – which to me really feels exceptionally manipulative. That might be because I never actually touched Humble, even years after I stopped believing in Santa. I have two younger siblings, so I guess I could rationalize it as not touching him for their sake, but… part of me just could not overcome the taboo about not touching the doll that my mother had instilled in me.
I’m eighteen now and in college, living in an off-campus apartment. I went home for Thanksgiving, of course, and sure enough, Humble was there on the mantlepiece. My sister Jenna loves the little creeper, full-heartedly believing he’s magic and works for Santa Claus. I felt a little guilty, her buying the story hook, line, and sinker, but decided it was none of my business.
When I got up Sunday morning, the day I was supposed to head back to my apartment, my mother asked me as covertly as she could if I knew where Humble was. He was missing, and no one in my house seemed to know where he went or would be likely to play such a cruel trick on our youngest member. When he couldn’t be found, my mom took Jenna aside and tried to explain that Humble must have been storm stayed at Santa’s Workshop. To everyone’s surprise, Jenna was delighted at the news. She said that she told Humble that she worried about me living away from home, and asked if he could spend some time at my apartment to make sure I was safe, and that’s where he must be.
My mother eagerly went along with this, since it gave her time to find a replacement doll, and told me to call as soon as I got to my apartment to confirm that Humble was safe and sound, *wink wink*.  I promised to call the second I got back, and after saying my farewells, I embarked on the hours-long drive back to my apartment.
I managed to get back before dark, which of course comes obscenely early this time of year, and as I awkwardly tried to make my way through the door with all my travel bags at once, I caught a glimpse of something bright red standing out against the off-white of my kitchenette.
It was Humble, sitting atop my Keurig with his legs crossed and his hands in his lap. I knew it was Humble because my mother had put a bell from a Lindt chocolate bunny around his waist like a belt and stuck a miniature candy cane in it.
The normally upsetting situation of someone breaking into my apartment was tempered by the fact that it had obviously been a member of my family, but who, and why?
Instead of calling them like I promised, I took a picture and texted it to my mom with the message ‘Did you do this?’.
Moments later the following conversation ensued:
‘Sweetie, y would u steal Humble? U know how much ur sister loves him’.
‘Mom, I swear, I didn’t steal him. I just found him here when I got home. If you didn’t do this, check to make sure you still have my spare key, because I know I locked up before I left.’
‘K, I just checked. It’s right where it should b. I asked ur father, and he doesn’t know anything either. He’s looking over the security camera footage to make sure we weren’t broken in to. Sweetie, I swear we didn’t do this. Maybe u should come back home or stay in a hotel until we figure this out.’
At this point I’ve searched my entire apartment for any sign of forced entry, a hidden intruder, something missing or damaged, and found absolutely nothing. The only thing out of place is Humble, and it makes no goddamn sense.
The most likely explanation was that someone in my family was messing with me, but I couldn’t think of anyone who would do this to me and Jenna, let alone have been able to have stolen Humble, drive to my apartment, place it, and then drive back undetected. The only other rational explanation was that I had a very stealthy, very skilled stalker who’d chosen an oddly specific way to mess with me.
Of course, there was an obvious irrational explanation for where Humble came from, but I shut down that line of thought immediately. It’s just a damn doll.
I really didn’t want to drive anymore and decided I couldn’t miss class the next day or waste money on a hotel, so I asked my boyfriend to spend the night, who was more than happy to oblige. That still left the issue of what to do with Humble. Obviously, I should’ve just mailed him back home, but that would’ve required that I move him.
That had to be why they did it. They knew I was still afraid to touch Humble and they were teasing me. That had to be it. However they did it, that had to be it.
This was good though, I thought. My unwillingness to touch Humble was childish, and I was all grown-up now. I needed to move past it. The doll was sitting right there on my coffee machine. All I had to do was grab him, put him in a box, and ship him out. My little sister gets her doll back, and I become just a little bit more mature. There was no rational reason not to do it.
I honestly can’t tell you how long I just stood there, staring at Humble, trying to muster up the courage to pick him up. It was ridiculous, but I just couldn’t do it. My mother had ingrained that taboo into me too damn well, and touching Humble would be like crushing a fairy.
“Hey, Humble,” I started mumbling. “I know my sister asked you to keep an eye on me, and I know you’re just trying to make her happy, but you’re supposed to be watching her to report back to Santa, remember? I know you used to watch me, but I’m grown-up now. I don’t even get presents from Santa anymore. You don’t need to watch me, and I’d hate for your report on Jenna to be inaccurate because you’re here and not there. So please, after you report back to the North Pole tonight, go back to Jenna and let her know I’m doing okay.” I opened the cupboard and pulled out a pack of blueberry turnovers, placing one beside Humble. “That’s for Santa. I know it’s probably not his favorite kind of cookie, but it’s all I have right now. Merry Christmas, Humble.”
I don’t know why I said those things. I don’t know why I gave him the cookie. I didn’t actually believe he was one of Santa’s Elves.  At least, I don’t think I did.
My boyfriend Sean arrived shortly after that. If he noticed Humble, he didn’t mention it. He’s a pretty typical college-age guy and so was eager to get to our bedroom activities, and I was eager for anything to get my mind off of Humble, so we got straight to it. I decided that if I still couldn’t find the will to box up Humble in the morning, I’d just asked Sean to do it for me.
I woke up the next morning in a considerably better mood, courtesy of the previous night’s afterglow. Sean was still sound asleep beside me, per usual, and then I remembered Humble, and that I would have to move him to make my coffee. I thought about waking Sean up for it, but told myself I was being ridiculous and to just do it myself.
But when I opened my bedroom door and looked into my kitchenette, Humble was gone, and so was the cookie.
My first thought was that Sean must have moved him at some point, but the only time he ever got out of bed was to use the washroom, which was adjacent to the bedroom and didn’t attach to the living area. He had proven himself time and time again to be completely incapable of getting out of bed without waking me up, so there was no way he went out there while I was sleeping. Even if he had, he never would have cleaned up the cookie. He might have eaten it, but then would have gone for more and left the package out (I know I’m not making him sound great here, but he’s mostly a drinking/bang buddy and I’m not planning on us being a long-term thing).
I immediately started searching for Humble, trying to find where in my tiny apartment he possibly could have gone, when I heard a notification from my phone, specifically the one I had set for texts from my sister. I sudden dread swept over me, a fear of something that should have been impossible somehow becoming the only conceivable explanation.
I picked up my phone, swiped it open, and when I clicked on messages, I saw a photo of Humble sitting on my sister’s bed, with the accompanying text:
‘Humble’s back! He wants me to tell you that Santa says thanks for the blueberry cookie. Chocolate chip’s his favorite, but it was still yummy!’
I was in shock, after that.  I didn’t know what to think. How could someone have stolen the doll, brought it here, snuck it out again, and then brought it home without leaving any sort of evidence? And why? I got another text from my Mom later, who seemed content to write the whole thing off as me and my sister playing a trick on her as payback for everything she ever made us believe about the doll. I insisted we weren’t, but soon gave up. I couldn’t blame my Mom for thinking that. It’s what I would have thought if I was in her position. I wish I had been in her position, instead of trying to figure out if I was being stalked, haunted by a possessed doll, or just going insane.
I was able to rule out the first option fairly quickly. I set up my phone to record the living room during the night. Nobody came in the front door, and there wasn’t the slightest sound of anyone coming in through any windows. And yet, come morning, there was Humble, cozied up in the camera’s blind spot. There was no way anyone could have put him there. I still couldn’t move him though, and I was through talking to him. This time Sean did ask about the doll, but all I told him was “It’s my sister’s, don’t touch it”, and he shrugged it off.
I set up my phone to record Humble that night, but it automatically restarted for updates and Humble escaped back to my sister unseen. It’s been going on like this for weeks now, Humble going back and forth between me and my sister. I’ve had Sean over every night, but I didn’t tell him why though, just that I was stressed with exams and the holidays and that I needed the dopamine boost, and that I wanted as much time together as possible before the Christmas Break split us up. He didn’t complain.
I don’t know what I thought he was protecting me from. Humble was just a doll, and he had never shown any signs that he meant me any harm. He was just a scout elf doing his job. It’s funny – that the phenomenon that was causing me so much terror was delighting my sister, and would have delighted me when I was younger. To Jenna, a toy moving on its own was all part of the Holiday magic. To me, it was an omen that the world did not operate the way I thought it did, and forced me to question my very sanity.
Yesterday, Friday the 20th, was the last day of classes. Humble was with my sister, and my boyfriend caught an overnight Greyhound to his family, so it was the first night in nearly three weeks that I was on my own. My plan was to drive back to my family on Saturday since I didn’t want to drive that far in the dark. This would, of course, mean I’d be left alone with Humble when he returned in the morning, which I coped with through my normal weekly ritual of excessive underage drinking.
I woke up this morning like I do most Saturdays; with a mild to moderate hangover and only a vague recollection of the previous night. I reached over to try to nudge my boyfriend to get me some coffee, only to remember he wasn’t there. I groaned and forced myself out of bed, stumbled out into the living area, and – just as I had expected – I’m greeted by Humble.
Except that today, he’s leaned up against the front door. I can’t leave the apartment – not without moving him. I was trapped.
I completely broke down then, dropping down to my knees and sobbing, demanding to know why he was tormenting me like this. I hadn’t done anything other than grow up.
That’s when I realized that, since I was crying and screaming at a doll, maybe I wasn’t as grown-up as I thought. I had thought that taking on five figures in student loans, getting shitfaced at least once a week, and settling for a practical boyfriend had all meant I was an adult, but I guess I was wrong.
Humble was supposed to get his power from the love of the child who owned him, and that used to be me. I guess that by never overcoming my reluctance to move him, I never really broke that bond, and he was legitimately split between me and Jenna. That really was it then, wasn’t it? All I had to do was shove him aside. I could even just ask someone to come over and when they came in Humble would just be pushed out of the way, but even that felt wrong somehow. As harrowing as this entire experience had been, there was still some part of me that was enchanted by the magic of it all, a part of me that most people lost a long time ago, and it was a part of that I still wasn’t ready to give up. And what about Jenna? My sweet little sister who loves her elf doll and still wanted to share him with me so that she’d know I’d be safe on my own. I couldn’t take away her experiencing actual Christmas Magic, could I?
I took another photo of Humble and texted it to Jenna, explaining that he had trapped me inside and I wouldn’t be coming home until tomorrow. She understood completely – she would never dare to move Humble either. Of course, a few minutes later I got a call from my Mom, and she was livid. She thought I was just too hungover to come home, ranting about how this was going to throw off the Holiday plans and what an irresponsible drunk I was turning into. Considering that I’m presently coping with the whole incident by dipping into a bottle of cherry schnapps I got as an early Christmas gift, I can’t say she’s wrong.
I’m still in my apartment right now. Humble hasn’t moved, of course, and I can’t force myself to move him. I’m not mad at him. I don’t think he’s doing this to hurt me. I think he just honestly believes I’m still one of his kids, and he’s doing his job the best he can. Today’s been rough, but tomorrow will be better. He’ll head back to my sister, I’m sure. Why wouldn’t he? That’s what he’s been doing for the past three weeks. He’ll be out of my way and I’ll be able to leave and head back home. My mom will have calmed down and just be happy to have me home and everything will be perfect, though she’ll probably try to talk me into doing dry January with her. All that matters is that with me and my sister under the same roof, Humble will stay put until Christmas Eve, and then this nightmare before Christmas will all be over. At least, until next year.
Maybe by then I’ll be a little more grown-up."	9.77	13.0	The Vesper's Bell	12/21/2019
Hallowed Ground	"I don’t think there’s anything more beautiful than a cemetery in the Fall, though I love cemeteries no matter the season.
There’s normally an abundance of majestically tall trees, more than you typically find in a public park, but not so many that they obstruct your view, like in the woods. At the peak of Autumn, you’re treated to a panoramic vista of vibrantly colored foliage dangling from the branches and blanketing the ground, rustling in the wind and crunching underfoot. The gravestones themselves have an apothic allure to them, ruggedly cut slabs of polished slate or granite or marble, their dark bodies glistening ever so slightly in the dappled sunlight, meticulously arranged row by row in solemn respect to those they stand in memorial to.
What I love the most though is the serenity, the tranquility, the quiet. Aside from the occasional funeral, they’re often entirely empty of visitors, and virtually never have more than a few at a time. The memento mori of rotting corpses only six feet underground must sour most people on the otherwise gorgeous landscaping. Not me though. I guess I’m something of a misanthropic loner to seek out solitude in the confines of a graveyard, but reminders of mortality don’t bother me. It’s comforting, if anything, that we set aside such charming sanctuaries for the dead.
It was on the first day of last October that I came across a new cemetery, one I had never been to before or even knew existed. I was taking a scenic route home along the countryside roads to admire the Fall landscape when I spotted the weathered gravestones up ahead. Pleasantly surprised at my discovery, I turned in without a second thought. The corroded metal arch over the gates only read ‘cemetery’. If the sign had ever borne a name, those letters had long since rusted away.
It wasn’t a large cemetery, maybe a little over a hundred yards across by a couple hundred long with a single looping gravel path, so I parked my car and explored it on foot. I was immediately enthralled by its pristine silence. I couldn’t hear even the most distant sign of human activity. The only noises were the cawing of crows, the scampering of small animals, and the wind blowing through the trees. The towering oaks and maples that populated the graveyard were stunningly dressed in their Fall colors beneath the somber grey sky, but the gravestones themselves were a different story. None of them were recent, and most were so worn they couldn’t even be read anymore. There were only two structures still standing upon the grounds; the delipidated remains of a maintenance shed and a small, marble mausoleum, my entrance barred by an iron gate. I walked the entire length of the cemetery, searching for any sign of recent activity. Plant overgrowth was limited, but that looked more like the work of grazing wildlife than a groundskeeper, and I came to the conclusion the place must be abandoned.
I was ecstatic. A small, quaint, aged cemetery all to myself.
I came back a couple of days later and reclined up against a large gravestone that I thought gave the best view, with a book in one hand and a Pumpkin Spice Latte in the other. I wasn’t usually so casual about my behavior in cemeteries, in case someone came across me and deemed it disrespectful, but after a brief web search on Ecosia yielded absolutely nothing about the cemetery, I was certain it was abandoned. If there’s one thing people find creepier than cemeteries, it’s abandoned, isolated, decaying cemeteries. I was quite confident that I wouldn’t be bothered, and that the long-forgotten person beneath me would be grateful for any attention at all after such prolonged neglect.
Once I had finished my drink and a couple of chapters of my book, I decided to get up and stretch my legs a bit. I nearly screamed out loud when I saw a man in a long black coat and wide-brimmed hat standing over a grave near the cemetery exit. In a more ordinary cemetery, his presence wouldn’t have been much cause for concern, but I was so utterly convinced that this place had been abandoned for ages that it seemed next to impossible that he was just paying his respects. My mind immediately assumed the worse, that he had seen me come in here and hoped to take advantage of my isolated state. If I were to scream at the top of my lungs out here, would anyone else even hear it?
I dropped back down behind the gravestone, waiting to see what he would do. He continued standing over the same grave, barely moving, and giving no indication that he even knew I was there. I pulled out my phone in the hopes of calling someone to pick me up, only to see that I had no reception. Not entirely unexpected, given the rural area I was in, but I still cursed my luck.
Twenty minutes to half an hour went by with no change, and I realized it was going to start getting dark soon. I decided it was better to walk past this guy in daylight than to risk being trapped with him in a graveyard at night. And it wasn’t like I was completely defenseless either. Being a woman with a penchant for wandering by herself in lonely areas, I had made it a habit to carry a small can of mace on my person, and I had taken some basic self-defense classes.
Gathering my things, with my mace concealed in the palm of my hand, I set off towards the exit, following the route that kept me the furthest from the stranger. I kept my gait steady, my breathing soft and level, and my gaze ever flicking back and forth between my car and the dark figure. At the sound of my footfalls drawing near, he listlessly lifted his head, gave a perfunctory nod, and – to my great relief – let me pass without incident.
A few days went by before I went back to the cemetery. My encounter with the stranger had left me a bit spooked, but since he’d done nothing to actually threaten me, maybe his presence there had been innocent after all. All I knew was that the spot was far too beautiful and secluded to give up without a more tangible threat to my safety. I went out for another leisurely country drive that eventually took me back to the cemetery, and as soon as I pulled into the entrance, there he was again. Or, possibly, there he was still, since he was standing over the exact same grave with his back to me.
Part of me wanted to back up and get the hell out of there, but at that point, I honestly was more curious than scared. If he had intended to do me harm, he could have done it the first time we were in the cemetery together, and it didn’t really make any sense that he would be lurking out in the open to ambush me days later on the off chance that I would come back. So, what the hell was he doing then? And how did he get here? I didn’t see any other vehicles around, though that I had escaped my attention during our first encounter.
Now that I wasn’t cornered, he didn’t look nearly as threatening as he had before. Instead, he seemed a forlorn, almost tragic figure standing over that grave. My curiosity was peaked, and I was resolved not to give up this cemetery, so I decided to speak with him. Shooting off a text to an acquaintance as a minimal precaution – which didn’t send immediately thanks to the poor reception – and palming my mace, I stepped out of my vehicle and approached him.
As I got closer, I became more confident, as I could see that his coat added a lot of bulk to him and that he was actually a rather frail man. He had sharp cheekbones over sunken cheeks and under darkly circled eyes. He was pale, but his skin also had an odd, almost silvery luster to it, if that makes sense. His hair was white, too white for someone who looked fifty at the oldest, but oddest of all were his eyes. They were this incredibly vibrant shade of green that stood out like two beryl gemstones in his silvery-white face.
It would be a shame to have to mace such beautiful eyes, I thought. Not that that would stop me.
“Ah, excuse me, Sir,” I squeaked out when I was a few feet away from him. He raised his head and turned it towards me, his face sternly melancholic but otherwise friendly enough. “I apologize if I’m intruding, but I saw you by this grave a few days ago. It’s just, it’s got me wondering since all the graves in this place seem far too ancient for any living person to have ever known the people buried in them so… I was just curious as to what you were doing here.”
The man nodded understandingly, seemingly aware of the oddness of what he was doing.
“The person buried here’s an ancestor of mine. Never knew them personally, but their deeds have been felt throughout my family for generations, and it’s been our tradition to honor them for that,” he said in a hoarse voice. “I’m the last of my bloodline now, so the honor falls to me alone.”
I turned my gaze to the moss-covered grave, scrutinizing it as best I could, but failed to discern any identifying features other than the outline of a cross. There was a single purple rose placed upon the ground, and several silver dollars placed along the base of the gravestone.
“What about you, Miss?” he asked. “What brings you to this place?”
“Oh. I, ah… I just like cemeteries,” I admitted sheepishly. “They’re pretty, and quiet.”
The man nodded with a slight smirk.
“Um… how did you get here?” I asked. “Did someone drop you off or do you live nearby?”
“The latter. Very much so,” he admitted, pointing towards an enormous evergreen tree. Beneath its sagging branches was a tent, along with some plastic totes and canvas bags.
“Oh. You’re squatting here?” I asked as sympathetically as I could. I was secretly relieved since the situation was starting to make at least a little sense. A secluded place like this was a perfect place to squat, and his homelessness explained his emaciated frame, his poorly-fitted coat, even his prematurely white hair. “But we’re miles from the nearest store. You don’t walk all the way there and then haul supplies all the way back, do you?”
“I have enough to last me ’til the end of the month,” he replied. “After that, it won’t matter.”
I mulled over asking what he meant by that, but decided better of it. I was unsure of his mental state, especially since I could see no evidence that this rather humble grave belonged to some venerated ancestor. I deemed it best just to let him believe whatever he wanted. I slipped the mace back into my pocket and pulled out my coin purse.
“May I?” I asked, gesturing to the row of coins he had laid along the base of the gravestone. He nodded appreciatively, and I left a token payment to his ancestor – or him – for using their graveyard. “Is it alright with you if I keep visiting? I really do like it here.”
“It’s not my cemetery, Miss. Do as you please,” he nodded.
“Thank you,” I smiled. I headed back to my car for my coffee, when I paused, tempted to ask him his name. I couldn’t do that though without offering mine in exchange, and as harmless as he now seemed, I still thought it best not to give him any compromising information about myself.
I visited the cemetery often for the rest of October, the foliage growing more vibrant and beautiful as the month progressed. I bought some pumpkins from a roadside stand and spent an afternoon carving them into Jack-O-Lanterns and scattered them across the grounds. I befriended the semi-feral barn cats that came there to hunt. I played in the piles of leaves like a little girl, pressed my favorite ones into a scrapbook, and just generally did whatever the hell I felt like. One day I examined each grave one by one, noting down anything I found interesting. Angels and crosses could still be made out on some of the headstones, but the only legible words were generic phrases like ‘gone too soon’, ‘beloved wife, husband, etc,’ and of course, ‘may she, he or they rest in peace’. Not one gravestone still had a date or a name left on it. It struck me as strange, of course, but I honestly had no idea of what to make of it.
Each time I entered the cemetery, I’d leave a few more coins by the “ancestor’s” grave as an offering. Sometimes the man would be standing there, but sometimes he’d be in or around his tent, other times he’d be walking around the rest of the graveyard, and on at least one occasion I wasn’t sure if he was there at all, though I have no idea where he would have gone. We acknowledged each other politely, but spoke seldom. We were both there because we wanted to be left alone, after all. I do realize that me going by myself to a cemetery with a possibly crazy homeless man might sound reckless, but after the first time we spoke I just never got the impression he was dangerous.
There was only one time he took issue with any of my activities, and that was when I tried to gain entry to the mausoleum. I was fiddling with the lock, thinking it was so old I could probably just break it, when I felt his cold hand grab my shoulder from behind.
“That’s a private mausoleum, Miss. Not open to the public,” he said firmly. “Leave it be.”
Looking back on it, I will say that he probably wasn’t justified in putting his hand on me when the reprimand alone would have sufficed, but at the time I just felt such an intense sensation of being caught doing something I wasn’t supposed to that I squeaked out an apology and scurried off to examine the maintenance shed instead. The most interesting thing I found there was one of those old, non-motorized lawnmowers.
On my next visit I brought him a deli sandwich; partially as an apology for my attempt at graverobbing, partially because I brought one for myself and didn’t feel right eating it in front of a homeless person, but also in the hopes of getting some information out of him.
He accepted it politely, but not exactly gratefully. More like it was a pack of store-brand socks from a secret Santa. He didn’t seem to care what he ate, or that he was underfed. He was sure he’d make it until the end of the month, and that was enough for him.
“So, how long have you been here already?” I asked between bites of my Rueben sandwich.
“Since I buried my father,” he murmured.
“Buried him here?” I asked in surprise.
“Wasn’t enough left for a proper burial, but this is consecrated ground, so it was good enough,” he said with a distant nod.
“I’m sure you did the best you could,” I assured him. His vague, cryptic answers did make me a little uneasy, but I had developed a sense of camaraderie with my fellow graveyard enthusiast, and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for the moment. “So, how much do you know about this place? I haven’t been able to find out anything about it. How old is it? Does it have a name? Why don’t any of the tombstones have names or dates left?”
The man just shook his head.
“All lost to time. Most of us are forgotten in less than a hundred years after we pass. No sense in the stones keeping names when those names won’t mean anything to anyone,” he claimed. I just nodded and finished my sandwich. I didn’t necessarily disagree with the sentiment, but it hardly explained the condition of the gravestones. I briefly entertained the thought that maybe he had chipped off all the dates and names, but quickly dismissed the notion. None of the gravestones appeared vandalized, just old. I eventually settled on the theory that the headstones had been mass-produced with the generic phrases pre-engraved and any personal information being only cheaply and shallowly carved, explaining why it had all eroded away. It wasn’t a perfect theory, but it was the best I could think of.
During the last week of October, there was a heavy rainstorm. When it started to lighten, I tossed on my coat and drove out to the cemetery, eager for the smell of wet leaves on the cool, damp air in my beloved sanctuary. When I arrived, I saw that the grave where I had been leaving my offerings had been dug up. Baffled, I ran from my car to the open grave without even shutting the door behind me. To my horror, I beheld the man, muddied and barely conscious, lying at the bottom of the freshly dug four-foot hole. He had evidently decided to take advantage of the rain-softened earth to exhume the grave, but in his fragile, half-starved state the excursion and the chill of the rain had been too much for him.
Without hesitation, I jumped into the grave, grabbed him from under the armpits and hoisted him up.
“What the hell were you thinking!” I demanded as I slung his body up onto the ground.
“I, I had to know for sure,” he mumbled. That was the only lucid sentence I got out of him for a while. I dragged him back to his tent, cleaned him up, put him in a blanket and got some water into him.
As he recuperated, I started thinking about what exactly my obligations were. I had known that he probably wasn’t mentally well, but I’d also thought he was harmless. Just a creepy loner who liked hanging out in graveyards, like me. But clearly, whatever delusions he clung to had just caused him to nearly kill himself. If I didn’t at least try to get him help, and he died, was I at fault for that? If I didn’t get him help, then who would? But would his delusions even let him leave the cemetery peacefully? The thought of him being dragged out of here by cops to be locked up in some asylum was soul-crushing. There was also the more selfish concern about what would happen to the cemetery if I brought it to the attention of government officials. I had fallen so in love with it, I had seriously started considering buying a camper and squatting here myself.
“Thank you.”
I was roused from my contemplation by the shameful and apologetic murmur from my tent mate.
“You’re lucky I came here when I did, dummy,” I said, giving him a punitive slap across the knee. “Otherwise you’d be just another nameless corpse right now. What were you trying to do? Do you even know?”
“It doesn’t matter,” he shook his head. I groaned, and shoved a cup of dollar-store instant ramen into his hand.
“Look, I can’t stay here all night. Are you going to be okay by yourself?” I asked.
“Yes, Miss. I’ll be fine. Thank you,” he nodded.
“Promise me you won’t do any more digging, or anything else that might make you keel over,” I demanded.
“I promise, Miss,” he swore. I sighed, and accepted that that would have to do. “I do have one small favor to ask, Miss.”
“And what’s that?” I asked as I put my raincoat back on.
“Halloween’s my last night here,” he said. “If it’s not too much trouble, would you mind seeing me off?”
Now, I, of course, wanted to know where the hell he thought he was going, but given his mental state, I figured it wouldn’t actually do any good to ask. If Halloween was some sort of locus for his delusions, then it was probably best for him not to be alone.
“Well, it’s not like I had any other plans,” I acquiesced. “Sure. I’ll be here at dusk. I’ll bring drinks and stuff.  We’ll have a little Halloween Party. I always meant to go to one of those.”
Halloween night came, I set out a bowl of fun-sized candy bars with a “Please take two” note posted to it, and drove off to the cemetery. I’d brought chips, dip, whiskey and ginger ale coolers, a sandwich platter, Halloween candy, my blue tooth speaker and a downloaded Halloween playlist that mostly had covers of ‘This is Halloween’, ‘Monster Mash’ and ‘Spooky Scary Skeletons’. Maybe not the wildest evening, but it was literally the first party I’d ever thrown, so cut me some slack.
When I pulled into the cemetery, I saw that he had placed a trash can in the center and started a bonfire, and surrounded it with my Jack-O-Lanterns. I was a little concerned about the safety of this, and that it might attract attention, but it did look amazing, and the night was cold enough that the warmth of the blaze would make the party much more enjoyable.
“This looks awesome!” I cried as I got out of my car and donned my kitty mask, putting out the spread on my car’s hood.
“All I did was put some leaves in a trash can and light a match. You’re the one who took the time to carve the pumpkins,” he said humbly, perched upon a headstone and staring into the fire.
“Yeah, I’m a real Michelangelo with gourds,” I said sarcastically, handing him a fox mask. “This time you’re not leaving me hanging. Tonight, you’re going to eat the food I brought and you’re going to enjoy it. You’re my only guest and I will not have you spoiling the evening for everyone else.”
“Yes Ma’am,” he chuckled, helping himself to the sandwich platter. I pulled out my phone, hit play on my music app, and started dancing to Johnathan Young’s cover of the Ghostbuster’s theme song.
Normally, I’m pretty self-conscious at social gatherings, to the point that I avoid them as much as I can without being rude, but since the only other person there was even more reserved than I was, I was able to cut loose a bit. I danced around the fire, I sang, I drank, I feasted and just generally made merry. It was the most fun I’d ever had at a party.
A couple of hours in and I was taking a breather, leaning up against my car and monologuing to the man about nothing in particular, when a strong gust of wind picked up and blew out the fire in the trash bin. I was taken aback, especially since all of the Jack-O-Lanterns stayed lit. The cold set in immediately. It was so cold that I could see my breath and frost forming on the ground. In the sparse candlelight, I could see that the man was roused from his normal melancholy. He craned his neck forward, and as I followed his gaze, I saw pale, blue flames appear one at a time, hovering in mid-air over each grave.
“Miss, stay inside the ring of Jack-O-Lanterns, and you’ll be safe,” he said as he quite deliberately stepped outside the ring. “They don’t want you anyway. Your offerings have been more than sufficient. I’m the one who owes them a debt.”
“Wait, what are you doing?” I whispered.
“I told you; tonight is my last night here,” he answered. The wind picked up again, howling like a wild dog, and yet the seemingly weightless apparitions remained exactly where they were.
“What are those things,” I asked, spinning around frantically at the surreal siege of fool’s fire.
“Will-o-the-wisps,” he said solemnly. “Spirits who’ve have been dead so long they no longer remember their human lives, and thus cannot summon human form. They appear here every All Hallow’s Eve, when the veil between the Elder World and ours is weakest.”
“You’ve seen these things before?” I asked, bewildered at both the supernatural spectacle and his mundane reaction to it. “So, they’re not dangerous?”
“No, they are, but the Jack-O-Lanterns are effective wards against them,” he assured me. The wisps started to move now, very gently and heedless of the wind, slowly bobbing towards me and the man.
“Well then get in here then! What are you doing?”
He hung his head and let out a long sigh of resignation.
“I broke my promise to you,” he confessed. “I finished digging up my ancestor, though I paced myself a little more this time. It was exactly what I was told it was; an immaculate corpse, incorruptible, perfectly preserved after lying in the earth for centuries. But despite its perfect condition, I can’t tell you a damn thing about it; not even if it was a man or a woman. That was part of the deal they made with the Elder Things so long ago; they traded their identity to ensure the prosperity of our family. Burying their corpse here made the cemetery Hallowed to the Elder Things. It’s why there are no names on the graves anymore; the wisps stole them, desperate for any semblance of humanity. It’s why this place is so hard for most people to perceive, let alone remember.”
“Listen to me, you’re not thinking clearly. Those things are just oxidizing gases from the graves,” I choked out, not believing it myself. “Let’s just get in my car and leave, and you’ll see we’ll be fine.”
“Do not leave that ring until they’re gone!” he ordered, the wisps slowly but steadily drawing nearer. “I have to do this. Part of my ancestor’s deal with the Elder Things was that each of their direct descendants would sacrifice themselves as well eventually, and every one of us who broke that pact brought ever-increasing misfortune upon us, until there was just me.
“I… thank you. I thought this place would be forgotten after I was gone. I don’t know why you can see and remember it, but so long as you do the wisps won’t be able to steal its identity completely. So long as you remember me, they won’t be able to steal mine. And, you did make my last month just a little more pleasant. Thank you.”
The wisps were all around him now, spinning in a languid vortex, nipping at him gently as if testing his mettle. His breath hung thick in the air, frost began condensing on his skin and clothes, and he shivered like it was fifty degrees below zero. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a keyring.
“The cemetery may not be mine, but the mausoleum is,” he said, throwing the keys into the ring of Jack-O-Lanterns. “It’s yours now, and everything inside it.”
Before I could ask anything more, the wisps engulfed him en masse. He was smothered in the cold blue flames, but he didn’t burn. Instead, each wisp seemed to take a bite out of him, each piece turning to a dark fluid vapor within their flames, greedily devouring him without even leaving a skeleton behind.
I, shamefully, was not a hero that night. I screamed and I cried at the sight of him being eaten alive, weeping and cowering as the wisps circled my protective ring. All I could do was pray that the Jack-O-Lanterns wouldn’t burn out.
Since that night, I’ve often wondered if I should be mad at him for inviting me to watch him die like that. If he had told me ahead of time, I never would have believed him, and would have insisted on being there anyway to make sure he didn’t harm himself. Even afterwards, I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t witnessed it myself. I never would have known what happened to him otherwise, and I am glad that he didn’t have to die alone, so I think it’s better this way. It’s hard to stay mad at the dead, anyway.
Once I knew exactly how special the cemetery really was, I followed through on my plans to live here. I gave my landlord my one month’s notice, bought a camper and some solar panels and set myself up near the woods in the back. I placed a proper font near the entrance where I throw my spare change, in the hopes of placating any Elder Things that might be watching. I brought a couple of people out there, just to test what the man told me, and all they can remember about it is that I have some trailer out in the middle of nowhere that they can never find without me. They can’t even remember it’s a cemetery.
I spend most of my free time here now. Despite what happened, and what this place is, I still love it. And I decided it was best not to take what I found in the mausoleum out of the cemetery.
It was filled with tomes, grimoires, honest-to-god spellbooks full of occult knowledge, presumably accumulated by the man’s ancestor. I’ve been studying them, too. I’ve become something of a Hedge Witch, you could say. And I know exactly what my first Grand Working is going to be.
I don’t think it’s fair that the man had to give himself to the wisps because of a deal his ancestor made. I don’t believe in ‘the sins of the father’ or anything like that. I know I didn’t know him that long, or that well – I still don’t even know his name – but by my standards at least, what we shared was fairly intimate. He was my friend, and I want to do more than just remember him. I plan to take his spirit back from the wisps and make him my familiar.
That’s why this Halloween, I’ll be throwing another party. This time, one wicked enough to wake the dead."	9.06	16.0	The Vesper's Bell	10/29/2019
I Found a Forum for Dead People	"It’s a tale as old as the internet itself. You’re killing your boredom by browsing the net. Mindlessly scrolling through pictures and reading through forums. One click leads to another, and before you know it you’ve tripped and fallen down the rabbit hole to the weirder parts of the internet.
Now, I’m not all that tech-savvy, but I suppose I’m intelligent enough to understand the concept of unlisted websites. Things you can’t find through a Google search, but that exists if you have a link provided. I guess that’s the essence of the deep web?

I tend to browse in incognito. I’m not gonna go into details, but I think we all know for what purpose.

Last night, or this morning, depending on how you classify 3 AM and insomnia; I was reading a forum about people’s weirdest experiences on the web. I am a skeptical fellow, so when a few diligent commenters provide a link I will gladly follow to verify their stories.

At some point, I happened upon a website that was simply an endless string of numbers ending in “.org,” leading to a plainly designed forum.

“How was your day?” was the main title of said forum.

It was a welcome change from the depressing and even horrific stories others had shared thus far in the night, so I decided to check out how people were doing around the world. Maybe focusing on other’s lives would take away focus from my own depressing existence.

I clicked on the top entry one listed.

When I first retired I was dumbfounded by the amount of dead time I would have to tirelessly get through.

Today, perhaps for the first time in ten years I appreciated the lazy morning. My wife made my favorite breakfast and I was even happy to take a mid-day nap afterwards.

I guess my body was just tired, because I never woke up from that. How do I let my wife know I didn’t pass in pain, and that I love her very much?

Mildly confused by his last statement, I checked out the comments below.

We all die sometime, welcome!

And another one said:

If you treated her right, she would know you loved her already.

“Some sort of role-playing forum?” was the first thought that came to me. The comments were a perfect collection of welcoming and spiteful comments. I clicked to the next post.

Honestly, I’ve always expected more from life. My day was shitty enough to begin with. Arguing with teenage children is a pointless endeavor that makes me long for the time when they were just happy to have pancakes for breakfast.

Anger is just as pointless, as I’ve come to discover far too late in life. The distraction was the only thing needed to somehow make me miss a red light and… Well, I’m not exactly sure what happened next, but here I am, my final day on this shit planet.

He signed his entry with his apparently real name and birthdate. It was a fairly uncommon name at that. I opened another tab to check his info in reference to any car accidents. All I found was some old news entry from 2004, but it perfectly matched his story to a tee.

What kind of sick person pretends to take the identity of someone who died such a horrific death? Both infuriated and intrigued I kept on reading. I can only blame my own sense of morbid curiosity.

I’m not entirely sure how long I spent reading through countless posts from people pretending to have died in various ways at different points in history. Everyone had signed with real names and not a single commenter called them out for their deluded games.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was when I noticed a post by a familiar name. My own mother, she had been dead for over a decade, so I felt fairly certain it was some sort of sick prank or bizarre role play. Maybe the users were looking up obituaries and taking their identities for their own pleasure. I was even more disturbed when they perfectly described the surroundings of her death despite never having told anyone.

I’ve been feeling extremely tired as of late. It was no surprise when I awoke this morning and felt like I hadn’t slept in days. I wanted to just stay in bed but family duties called. My husband had already left for work and I had taken the week off in hopes of recovering, but someone has to feed the kids.

Breakfast was alright, I fed them their favorite, pancakes. Easy to prepare and I had nothing better to do.

I remember getting into the shower, but it was getting really hard to catch my breath, and under the steam from the hot water I simply passed out. I don’t really know what happened after that.

Oh, God, I hope my children didn’t see me lying naked on the floor.

I decided right then I would be the righteous one to make them stop stealing people’s identities. At least use a fake name if it was nothing more than a pathetic joke. I scanned the page for a register button only to find I was already logged in; Under my real name as a matter of fact.

With some trepidation, I clicked to expand my profile. On it, someone had written my name, email address, birthdate and…

…death date: Today.

Yet again my eyes wandered to the title of the website:

“How was your day?”

I thought back and reflected on what had happened so far. My life wasn’t the most interesting so I hadn’t really taken the time to think about it.

There was nothing particularly interesting about my day. Exam period was coming up so I had to wake up earlier than my young brain was used to.

I drank coffee, browsed the internet instead of studying, the procrastination lasted longer than I’m proud to admit. Though I eventually felt guilty enough to pick up a textbook and studied until the evening.

A mild headache set in, it was enough to stop me from studying and do something more relaxing instead.

Actually, it might have been more than mild. More like a stabbing pain rapidly increasing in intensity. I got up from my chair and fell to the floor, that’s all I remember before blacking out.

It’s a peculiar feeling when your heart stops, but apparently that’s what it takes for you to be able to access the forum for dead people.

They brought me back though. I have a vague memory of paramedics bringing me to the hospital, needles being shoved into my veins. I guess my dad must have come upstairs to check on me. Lucky me.

I don’t really remember much from the hospital, nor returning home.

As a matter of fact I just now find myself browsing this forum, not really remembering how I stumbled across it.

“How was your day?”"	9.92	12.0	Richard Saxon	01/05/2019
Roommates	"The second Darryl’s keys were rattling in the lock Katie was off the couch and racing to the front door.
“Did you do it?  Did you do it?”  She was practically bouncing up and down with giddy anticipation and unwilling to give him a second to even breathe.  “Did you kill her?  Is it done?”  Darryl couldn’t help but to smile and shake his head.  She was such a bad influence on him.  He tried to remember the first time they had met but for some reason was unable to.  It just kind of seemed like she had always been there.  Tim and Jerry had been his roommates for close to eight years and somewhere along the way she just kind of fell in with the twin brothers.  Before Darryl knew what happened she was living in the little, two-bedroom house as well.
Remembering when the guys moved in was a little easier.  He had like them both immensely the first time they had met and fell hard for their sob story of growing up as orphans with no real family other than each other.  That wasn’t the real reason he extended the invitation, however.  The truth was…they were fun.  Age wise, they were technically adults, but their maturity level in no way reflected  that .  Neither of them ever bothered growing up and there was really no telling what they might be getting into at any point in time.  Plus they really like to play up the identical twin aspect and enjoyed going with the same look as each other every day.  Darryl could tell them apart…at the moment Tim’s hair was just a bit shorter than Jerry’s…but most people didn’t have a clue.
Tim had told him once, quite some time ago, the story of how they’d met Katie in the area but Darryl really didn’t retain it.  Tim had verbal diarrhea and a different story or ten every day; it would have been impossible to try and keep them all in the memory banks.  Tim’s condition was aided considerably by the fact that he always had a bag of green herbs nearby.  Jerry wasn’t quite the stoner his brother was but he did partake from time to time.
Darryl hadn’t complained when Katie started hanging around.  There was something about her that he found truly compelling.  It wasn’t that he had the hots for her or anything like that…she was not at all his type; but she was sweet and funny and an absolute dynamo of highly contagious positive energy.  He loved the way that she kept them all in line and yet on their toes at the same time.  For all these reasons and others that he didn’t fully understand, she could talk him into practically anything.  She had an innate ability to persuade him into activities that most people would consider irrational; and a way of making sense out of it in the process.
That’s the way it was with Julie, his soon to be deceased ex-girlfriend and Marcus, his recently deceased ex-best friend.  As crushing a blow as discovering their secret liaison was, Darryl was originally going to just break off both relationships and count his blessings that he discovered the infidelity when he did and not further down the road when she might have been his wife and he might have been his best man.  It had been Katie who finally got him to see the reasoning behind ending their lives.  They were, after all, bad people.  Who knows who else they would have ended up hurting in the long run?
It was the same thing with Yuri Melosh the Ukrainian guy who used to live down the street that swindled Darryl out of nearly three grand in his Ponzi scheme.  How many little old ladies would he have cleaned out before someone finally stopped him?  Then there was Pritchett Rickets the prick who kept pinching his clients by undercutting his offers on jobs.  Darryl was one of the best small job carpenters in the area but somehow that damned Rickets was always on his tail.
It was Katie that pointed out that the unscrupulous man must have been following Darryl.  It also stood to her reasoning that there was no possible way of just cutting leech out of his life…other than killing him of course.  Father Michener was the only one Darryl tried putting up a significant argument against; and even now it weighed on his conscience.
Father Andrew Michener had been the pastor at the local Catholic Church for nearly forty years before he passed on.  Darryl’s grandmother, who left the little house to him when she died, attended services there twice a week, every week, until she died and the priest had grown fondly attached to the long-time widow.  When Darryl moved in nine years ago, Father Michener had made it a point to visit the home and check in on Doris’s grandson and Darryl quite liked the pleasant man…not enough to attend his church; but he did like him.
It was Tim and Jerry who initially didn’t care for him.  The first time they met, the Father made a light-hearted joke about them being free-loaders who didn’t pay rent and, despite the lack of malicious intent, the guys, who never took offense at anything, had their feeling hurt.  That was really no big deal but the priest continued to make weekly recruiting visits and eventually Katie was the one to see the demons in him.  Absolutely terrified the first time she saw the man and the creatures possessing him from within, she later explained that the gift was called “discernment” and that she had always been able to see unclean spirits.
Darryl fought her for some time on the issue but her fear was real and Katie never lied to him…or anyone for that matter; she was truthful to a brutal fault and in the end:  he believed.  He believed in a world beyond the one he could, he believed that Katie had gifts that he didn’t and, above all, he believed her when she said they would be plagued by demonic attacks if the poor man wasn’t put out of his misery.  It was, by her estimation, a mercy killing.  Darryl had been hoping that moment of bestowed mercy would be the last time he would have to deal with such unpleasant things…but…here he was again.
“So…” she pressed, “Are you going to answer me or what?”  Darryl chuckled again and pushed past her to the living room.
“Are you going to give me a chance to actually answer?”
Katie feigned offense behind him and said, “Well excuse me…by all means.”  Tim and Jerry were wrestling with each other on the couch like a couple of teenage boys and didn’t bring it to an end until Darryl plopped down on the couch next to them, diverting their attention.
“Well?”  Jerry asked what they were all thinking.
“He hasn’t said.”  Katie had positioned herself on the lazy-boy across from them.  “For some reason he’s trying to play it cool which…” she paused for effect, “is not cool”.   The brothers began to fall all over each other with raucous laughter which brought Darryl’s attention to the empty baggie and green herbs strung about the coffee table.  They were high as kites.  Sometimes living with those two was like being in a frat house…or having children maybe.  He definitely didn’t take them as seriously as he did his female roommate.
“Well…” Darryl finally spoke, “Not that you two yahoos will remember later.”  He was looking at the twins and they fell into another round of side-splitting.  “But…yea…I did it.  I cut her brake line.”  Katie’s jaw dropped.
“You cut her break line?” she repeated.  Darryl proudly nodded ‘yes’ but the pride only lasted a moment before Katie made her displeasure known.  “What the hell Darryl?  That’s not what we talked about.  You were supposed to poison her or stab her.  Where the hell did you come up with cutting the brake line.”  She sighed, exasperated.  “How do you even know which one is the brake line?”
“YouTube,” Darryl replied sheepishly.  “I looked it up.”  The brothers couldn’t stop laughing, Jerry actually falling to the floor and holding his sides.  Katie didn’t find it funny at all.
“You looked up a video on how to cut a brake line and then you went and cut someone’s brake line?  Please tell me you at least used a guest account on a computer somewhere else.”  She seemed like she couldn’t even believe she was having to ask and it was the complete opposite of the reaction he had been expecting.  Especially when he could only mumble “I used my phone”.  Katie jumped across to the couch and slapped him in the face, drawing blood with her nails.
“You fucking idiot!” she yelled in his face.  “You’ve screwed us all.”  Tim joined his brother, rolling on the floor as neither seemed to grasp why Katie was so upset.  “What are we supposed to do when you get arrested?”  Darryl was genuinely shocked.  Why would he be arrested?     
“I…I don’t understand.” Was all he could say and Katie shook her head with sick pity but was not given the opportunity to explain.  The next few seconds passed in a blur.  Broken glass filled the room from the windows and chunks of wood flew in from the hall where the front door had been smashed from its hinges.  Suddenly the room was full of men in black armor from head to tail, flashing lights and screaming.  Violently thrown to the floor and handcuffed, Darryl couldn’t see what condition his roommates were in.  Much like him, they were probably overwhelmed by the sudden flurry of activity.
Jerked to his feet and hustled down the hall, he knew that he would probably be in some degree of trouble but he truly hoped that his friends wouldn’t be charged with anything.  He didn’t see them being cuffed and his name was the only one they stated as being under arrest and Mirandized so hopefully they could be left out of whatever mess this turned into.  As he was being pulled out the front door, Darryl called out over his shoulder, desperately hoping they could hear him.  “Don’t say anything guys.  Don’t say a word.”  By that point, it was the best he could do.  An hour later he was behind bars, barring the death penalty, for the rest of his life.

Toya Pearson couldn’t help but to curse when the call came in at one forty-five in the morning.  Raising two girls as a single mom combined with a job that could call at any moment, as the current call proved, sleep was proving more and more elusive.  The moment the ringtone woke her from deep sleep she knew she was done for the night…she didn’t even have to answer it.
It did, however, turn out to be a rather interesting call though.  The department had arrested a rather notorious serial killer.  Not that it wasn’t good news…one less sicko on the streets was good for everybody, but that wasn’t the part that particularly interested her.  It was his pets.  Normally, the rare personality that fell into his range didn’t keep pets…not living ones anyway; but this man had three cats which were currently in the kennel at headquarters.
Were it not such a high profile case the animals would have most likely been turned over to Animal Control or the Humane Society but given the uniqueness of the situation they thought to call her.  Toya’s official title was that of a Detective Profiler but everyone knew that her true passion was her feline rescue group.  No one had a problem turning Katie, Tim and Jerry over to her and, rather that put them through further trauma, she decided to keep them in the end.  They won her over rather quickly with their infectious personalities and her girls fell in love immediately as well.  The youngest, Sarah, even claims that they speak to her.  It’s adorable."	9.82	11.0	Shannon Higdon	01/25/2018
The Psychopath	"Mena had been in the shower for nearly an hour when the water-heater spit out the last drops having any semblance of warmth to them, prompting her to quickly shut off the flow before that damn chill re-attached itself to her.  It was honestly the first time she had felt warm in a week.  There were only two towels and they were…suspect, at best, but she made do nonetheless.  The odds of her winning the lottery were probably higher than the odds of finding anything clean in this place.  Two weeks ago something like that would have driven her crazy.
In a race against the cold, Mena dried off and put on the only clothes she could find that stood any chance of staying on her frame.  Obviously, there would be nothing that would fit her, but with creative use of a belt, a red-flannel shirt acted as a dress and a pair of long-underwear were turned into baggy leggings.  She placed three pairs of socks on each foot to act as shoes; avoiding the bathroom mirror at all costs.
The prospects in the kitchen were just as bleak.  An extensive search turned up a half a loaf of stale, but fortunately mold-free, bread, unopened cans of green beans and corn and some ketchup.  There was a large, meat-freezer in the corner of the filthy kitchen but…she wasn’t that hungry yet.  She opened the cans at the table and put the ketchup on the bread; it was Thanksgiving dinner!  She ate like a wild animal, lips-smacking, mouth open, and giggling uncontrollably while she did.
Mena had never known such hunger existed.  Despite that, she had to stop half-way through her feast; her stomach had shrunk and it was painfully evident that if she continued to shove it in, it would just come right back out.  Her stomach gurgled in unsettled agreement and she washed it down with a glass of ruddy tap-water.  Leaving her mess on the table, she stood, stretched and yawned loudly; she was exhausted.  She could sleep for a week…if only.
Meandering to the living room, stepping over a deconstructed lawn-mower and small stack of plastic, Christmas reindeer lawn ornaments on the way, she finally collapsed on the couch.  It was the only piece of furniture in the room that hadn’t disappeared beneath a pile of crap in this hoarder’s wet-dream of a house.  The television remote was on the floor next to the well-worn couch and Mena flipped on the old tube-style RCA across the room.
After a couple seconds of flickering, the picture came to life and the colorized version of “It’s a Wonderful Life” began to play.  Mena sighed; was it close to Christmas?  She couldn’t remember.  It seemed there was quite a bit that she couldn’t remember.  She flipped through the channels before stopping at her own face.  It was her cheerleading picture.  She loved that picture.  Smiling, Mena turned up the volume.
“…again Jane, authorities are asking for any information that anyone might have that could aid the investigation, please call the number at the bottom of the screen.  Mena Renee Metzler, seventeen, was last seen at the Hardwick Exxon on Claymore and Forty-ninth Avenue eight days ago.  Her twenty-eleven Subaru WRX, was found deserted on Mishway Road and authorities do believe there were signs of a struggle.  Police do believe there is a strong possibility that Mena may still be in the area and,” they changed the picture to one of her at the beach last summer with her mom and dad.  That was a good day.  “…they are asking everyone to please keep their eyes open and…”  Mena turned the volume back down.
She looked at the picture on the television and then at her own greasy, stringy blonde hair; so many damn split-ends!
“Fuck it,” she said to no one as she got back up and made her way back down the hall to the bathroom.  She didn’t want to see before, but now…now she did.  Using one of the wet towels she had tossed on the floor, Mena scrubbed away as much of the crud from the mirror as she could and took a good, long look.  Wow.  She knew it was going to be bad, but this…could this have really happened in one week?  It had felt like a month at the time and now…now it kind of looked that way as well.  Mena was a shadow of herself.
She recognized her eyes, but that was about it.  Her skin looked sickly pale and was pulled taut against her bony frame.  There were large, black circles around her eyes and her cheek-bones seemed to poke out at a sharp angles that never existed before.  It was like someone’s sick Photoshop joke; a skeletonized version of her former self.  She sighed, immediately regretting the decision to look but in no way letting kill her amazing mood.
“Oh well,” she said before spinning on her socked heels and heading back to the couch.  “I was wanting to lose a few pounds anyway.”  Giggling to herself, Mena pulled the dingy blanket from the back of the couch over her shoulders and, using her arm as a pillow, proceeded to drift away into a very well-deserved sleep.  Her last thought before REM took her completely being, maybe I should call someone first.
She was awoken some time later by a banging from downstairs.  Mena cursed that it woke her and, sitting upright and stretching, tried to figure out just how long she might have been asleep.  There were many, many windows in the old estate but they did her no good as they were all boarded shut with hammer and nails, not even allowing the thinnest streams of sunlight to enter; if it were daytime.  Was it daytime?  Another series of bangs from the basement caused Mena to pick up a shovel from next to the couch and smash it against the floor several times.
“I SAID SHUT UP!”  She screamed with all her lungs would offer.  Well…she was awake now, and she was getting hungry again.  There was no way round two in that kitchen would be as appealing as it was the first time.  It was getting to be about time to get the hell out of here and get some real food…tacos…oh yea, tacos.  Her stomach began to roil from the thought.
The front door was sealed with no less than eight key-entry locks…on both sides.  Cursing to herself, Mena tried to remember where she had seen the keys.  She had become so conditioned to hate and fear the jingling of that damn key-ring it was genuinely surprising that she couldn’t remember where it was.  She would have liked to been able to pace while she thought…she was a pacer…but the house didn’t really offer a great area to do so, so instead she carefully hiked around the first floor searching for it and trying to avoid the debris and scurrying rats.  There were rats everywhere.  When the next series of banging came it hit her:  of course, they were in the basement…with him.
Just as well, she needed to end this anyway and say her goodbyes; kill two birds with one stone.  Stopping in the bathroom first to pee and grab the fire axe from the bathtub, Mena made her way down the rickety steps to the stone-walled basement.  In a striking dichotomy to the upstairs, the basement was free of clutter and trash; exactly opposite what one would expect.  The torture chamber Edward, whom the media had dubbed “The High-School Killer”, had built down there was one of precision.  Everything had a place and everything had a purpose.
Tools and blades hung from one wall which could, at first glance, look like any man’s workshop…until you starting taking a good look at what he liked to work with.  The opposite wall, lined with shelves, held jar after jar of body parts in formaldehyde and even then one could be forgiven for thinking it might just be a mortuary.  However, when the mounted hand-cuffs, leather strapped beds and variety of harnesses and hooks come into view it becomes painfully clear that one is in the belly of the beast.  Mena still couldn’t bring herself to look at the butcher’s corner of the room despite her lengthy stay in it.
“How in the hell are you making that much noise?”  She was genuinely curious since he was chained to a stone wall.  Of course, he couldn’t answer with ball-gag in his mouth, but he certainly tried; spittle and snot flying off to the side.  “Hold on…hold on,” she made her way over to him, “that’s disgusting.  Just stop.”  Mena didn’t want to touch the ball-gag at all; it was gross, but they needed to talk and it wasn’t going to work this way.  She reached around to the back of his head and unsnapped the S&M device.
“I have to pee!” he screamed at her.
“So pee.” She replied.
“You bitch,” he hissed at her and lunged forward as far as he could, snapping his teeth together.  Mena did not flinch and he seemed to change his tune quickly.  “Pleeeaase?  I have to pee.”  Mena smiled.
“Maybe I can help.”  With the dull end of the fire axe still in her hand, she lunged it forward into his gut; a flood of wetness soaking his pants and spilling down into a puddle around his feet.  After several long seconds of struggling to get his breath back, Edward began to release a string of creative profanities directed her way, many describing the violent ways he was going to desecrate her.  Mena just listened and smiled.
She remembered a day when she was ten.  Her parents had taken her to Disney World on the premise that they were visiting relatives.  When they woke her up in the car, just in time to see the massive “Welcome to Disney World” sign, it was, quite possibly, the happiest moment in her life.  Sure there had been all kinds of great moments of happiness in her life, but that one had always stood out as the best.  Until now.  Damned if she wasn’t just giddy.
“Daddy?” she said in a baby voice, interrupting his tirade.  “Daaaaddy…daddy?”  He finally stopped and stared at her, eyes wide…lips trembling.  “What’s wong?” she stayed in her baby voice, “You don’t wike it when I call you ‘Daddy’ anymoe?”  Silently, he shook his head ‘no’.  “How come, daddy?  It’s what you always wanted befow.  Am I not s’posed to be your wittle baby any moe?”
“Please stop.”  There was something in his voice she had never heard before; something she loved hearing:  fear.  If it hadn’t made her physically ill to do the voice she wouldn’t have quit, but it had made her point well.  “Please let me go.  I won’t say anything.”  Mena fell over with laughter, using the axe to keep her upright.  This was almost better than a comedy show.
“You won’t say anything…you?”  She shook her head.  “Wow Eddie, you really are a messed up dude.  Aren’t you worried that I would say something?  Let’s suppose I let you go, Edward, what would you do then?”  He shook his head.  The conversation was going in a direction he wasn’t prepared for but needed for it to go, regardless.
“I…I don’t…I’ll move.  I’ll leave.  You’ll never see or hear from me again.  And money…I’ve got some money.  I can pay you.  Please?”  He was pleading.  It was pathetic.  It was wonderful.
“Eddie,” she sighed, “you didn’t say the one thing you should have said.”
“What?  What?  Anything…what?  Just tell me.”
“What you should have said is, ‘I won’t kill and eat people anymore’.  That’s what you should have said.”
“I won’t…I won’t” he was frantic.  “I swear I won’t…never again.  I’ve learned my lesson.”  His cadence slowed as he tried to express sincerity.  “I know I’m sick, Mena.  I want to get help.  I want to get better.”  Mena nodded in agreement.
“Well…you’re right about one thing.  You are sick.  I tell you what Eddie, I’ll think about it.”   Mena eyed the key-ring on a metal shelf and went to retrieve it.  “In the meantime, you just hang out.”  She giggled again and headed back to the stairs.
“Wha…What?  You’re just going to leave me here?”  He seemed outraged.  “Fine bitch…just call the cops then!”  This stopped Mena in her tracks and she turned back around.
“Edward…do you know how long a person can go without food and water?”  He said nothing and after a pause she continued.  “I mean, you should know…right?  You’re kind of an expert on keeping people alive on the smallest amount of each as possible.  So…do you know?”  He hung his head down, still silent.  “Okay…it’s fine, I’ll just Google it when I get home; I know it can be difficult to remember in stressful situations.”
Dropping the axe on the floor with a clank, Mena went to the wall of tools and selected a small, sharp utility knife before going back to Edward and quickly lashing out at his chest, slicing it nearly five inches across.  It wasn’t deep at all; hardly life-threatening, but he blood began to flow down his chest, soaking in to his pants.  Edward didn’t give her the satisfaction of a scream and she tossed the knife aside and began to head back to the stairs again.
“Two things Edward.  First:  you have a real rat problem here; and second,” she said as she reached the first step.  “Why would I call the cops?”"	9.53	15.0	Shannon Higdon	12/30/2017
He Who Wanders	"I missed the scorching wind of Andalusia. How it pours sunlight onto your face, toying with eyelashes, flattening dry sand against cheeks and milling around hair. I missed the smell of the valley and that ripening softness of Muscat fluff glistening in the afternoon breeze.
From up here I can see the house where I grew up. I see white chapels tucked into grape orchards like pawns scattered on a chess board. I see patches of asphalt on El Jardinito Road hailing from the old town through dappled rocks, then waning behind the horizon with erratic headlights of cruising beat-up trucks.
One of the pit stops along Ed Jardinito, where truck drivers stop to relieve themselves, marks the starting point to this wavy path. All covered in blotches of spindly grass stalks and flaxen sand, the path is barely noticeable at first. Truth is, no one even cares to notice it. Why would truckers taking a blitz-leak care to check on some mucky trail leading to God knows where? But I do. This is how I got up here, to the top of this hill, where I am standing now. I’ve climbed all the way up here, so I can finally end it all – all these years of vagrancy and fugue, exile and fear. This is where it’s all going to come to an end.
But for now, I am enjoying the view of the valley unfolding below. I am sipping the air of what could be my final memories.
He will show up soon. He always does. Like a shadow, he’s been following me right on my footsteps, always there, behind me. And there he is!
His limping figure appears behind the sharp bend off El Jardinito. He looks up and he sees me, then stops for a moment to catch his breath and leans on his cane, as if assessing the remaining trajectory for this final stretch, then resumes his walk. Or should I say, “resumes his agonizing trudging”. Years of endless chase took a toll on his body. No wonder. How long has he been chasing me? Ten, twenty, thirty years?
He is slow. Methodically slow. But for once, I will not run. I will wait. Right here, behind this rock. I will finally come face to face with him, and this Swiss blade in my hand will lance right through his neck bone. Yes, that’s what I am going to do.
This ends here, at the dead end of this sandy trail atop the hill overlooking the valley with its white chapels and Muscat orchards.
Funny. After all these years, I still don’t know the real name of my chaser. I always called him what master Borges called him – “He who wanders”.
Listen, He who wanders. I will kill you.

Borges. The Borges. I idolized him when I was in college. Many did, but I was different. It was 1961. I was an average lazy learner at the Universidad Laboral de Córdoba, floating around from one semester to another with barely passable grades. I had very few friends and even fewer interests – a classic textbook example of a young man with a severe form of identity crisis.
Besides chugging Anisado, my only other passion was Latin American Literature. Borges and Neruda were at the forefront. One could only imagine my excitement, when I stumbled upon a pamphlet hanging on the wall of the Literature faculty.
Spaces were limited. But who cared? It was the man himself, Jorge Luis Borges, coming right here, to our school, to give us a lecture followed by an open panel of questions. Like a maniac I rushed to the auditorium hours before the lecture. I was the first in line and when the doors opened, I sprinted towards the front row seat. The auditorium was soon packed with drooling chins of young self-proclaimed prodigies, awaiting the arrival of the great one.
And there he was – the blind Lord of Literature – walking upright onto the stage with a cane and his loyal assistant right by his side. Standing ovation. Borges nodded and made a “thank you, please be seated” gesture.
Then he began. The lecture was dedicated to Spanish writers, I cannot distinctly recall if it was Cervantes or De Vega. It truly made no difference. Somehow, I managed to sit through his entire lecture, which lasted over 3 hours, and remember nothing. He talked slowly and methodically, pouring honey into our ears like Segovia’s guitar, with his absent eyesight affixed on the ceiling.
To wrap up the lecture, Borges was about to take questions from the audience. Of course, I raised my hand and so did about hundreds of other students. One of Borges’ assistants whispered something into his ear, which made him smile and nod.
“It is always a privilege to answer questions coming from a young audience,” said Borges with his blind eyesight still pinned on the far corner of the hall, “but our time is not infinite, and neither is my old tongue. I am afraid, I can only handle one, maybe two questions. For that reason, I will randomly point my hand and pick someone from the audience to ask a question.”
I have never won any prizes or lotteries in my life. When I played poker or blackjack, I lost far more than I won. I knew my limitations and that turned me into an average apathetic person, rarely trying to outdo oneself. And so, sitting still with little ambition – I got used to that.
Until that moment. When I saw Borges pointing his hand in my direction, that came as nothing short of a shock.
“Me?”
“Yes, young man. Senor Borges picked you. Step forward and introduce yourself,” said his assistant.
I did not know what to ask. Or maybe I knew but all thoughts must have gushed out of my brain through sweat pores.
“My name is Fernandez Augustin Navaro.”
Borges shifted his gray-shaded pupils in my direction as if reacting to a sudden buzzing of a fruit fly.
“Fernandez Augustin Navaro.” He said. “Navaro… Haven’t I met you before, young man?”
“No senor Borges. I never had the honour -”
“But you will. We will meet again, Senor Navaro. You and I will meet again. But for right now, let me hear your question.”
The rest of the day was foggy. I don’t even remember what question I asked, it must have been about him winning the Prix International, not sure. And maybe not important. No, not important at all.
The greatest writer in the history of mankind called me by name and then that bizarre unreal thing he said about us meeting again. When?

Nine years later. In 1970.
And there I was – a somewhat-promising journalist in one of London’s somewhat-scandalous tabloid newspapers. Every week my name was featured on the third page alongside with celebrity chronicles and vile rumors. My paycheck was decent enough for a small studio flat by Manchester Square. After years of having been pent-up by directionless studies, you could say I became something more than an average. Or at least that was what I believed.
That day (it was early October, arguably the best season in London) began on the usual note. I ate my chic breakfast consisting of two scrambled eggs, ham, toast and dark roast coffee at Barrymore’s Diner and was ready for a pleasant walk to the office. It was shortly after 8am, and I was in no hurry.
My route was the same as it was every day: pass the square, right turn on George Street, left turn on Thayer, another right on Marylebone. My morning thoughts were all preoccupied with the piece I was working on, so I was slowly making my way through the square, when something caught my eye.
Or rather, someone. At first, I did not pay much attention to him, no more than I did to everyone who idled at the square. Hippy rascals with soiled hair strumming guitar on every corner was a common theme those days, and London town was certainly no exception. So, here was another one of those misunderstood love proclaimers, sitting right behind the gated area of the square. Striped worn out jacket, heavy cap, sandals with clots of woolen socks sticking out. A common hippy bum as anyone may have thought. I thought so too except this one had something that made my intestines churn. I didn’t know what it was, but once I saw him, I felt the irresistible urge to instantly walk away and never see him again.
The way he looked at me, that gloomy frown that made me think of a line from Oscar Wilde, “that fellow’s got to swing”. There certainly was something outer worldly about that “fellow”. His eyes were piercing through my flesh with thousands of tiny holes.
I added pace. As I turned back one last time, I noticed him making his way towards me. Past the gates of the square, onto the street, paying no attention to screeching tires of honking cars.
George Street was empty like in post-war bombed quarters. So quiet that I could hear my footsteps. Or was it the drubbing of my aorta against the chest? Good heavens, he was catching up, mere ten yards away!
He’s just a bum. No, he is not.
Just another one of those unwashed hippies. Run!
I ran. I ran faster than my feet could move. I ran, not quite understanding why or where, all I could sense was that feeling, that primordial sense of fear, that unexplainable sensation of looming doom arching above like a dark figure with a scythe.
As I turned the corner on Thayer, I paused and bent forward. I leant hands on my knees and tried to stabilize my thumping breath. Scrambled eggs, toast and dark roast coffee were about to make their way back up through my esophagus. I could feel sweat from my palms forming two gigantic blotches on pants right above each kneecap.
I looked back trying to see him. Nothing. Empty windows of Thayer Street were checking me out like a toddler witnessing parent in a cowardly act. Whoever that man was that incensed uncontrollable panic, he was now gone.
Shame on you, Fernandez Augustin, I repeated to myself while making futile attempts to enthrall palpitation. Shame on you. I mumbled repeating that word. Mumbling turned into whistling that song by “Magic Lanterns”. Shame, shame. I whistled, acting calm and self-composed. I sang without knowing words only to convert my mind to something else. I sang so others wouldn’t notice me shaking.
I climbed the stairs of my office building. Three at a time. Third floor. Familiar smell of typography oils calmed me down. Safe heaven. Shame on you, Fernandez Augustin Navaro.
* * * * * *
Even now I question myself whether my descent to madness began on that day or was it underway for years. Madness that creeps in and recedes in tidal waves – is that how it usually happens?
All I know is that an hour later I was sitting at my office desk, laughing at that little moment of weaknesses.
Preposterous and rubbish, my thick Andalusian twang spoke to me. The idea of being fully checked out by a specialist did cross my mind, and I immediately thought of Doctor Patel in Camden Town. He’d give me a comfortable medical diagnosis like panic attack and prescribe some white pills to be taken twice a day, preferably with meal.
Little did I know that the day had more surprises in store. The unnerving script development continued in a more eerie fashion when my boss marched to my desk with a pack of printed paper.
No, Navaro you are not going to see bloody Doctor Patel in Camden Town who will make a judgment call on your insanity. Instead you are going to do an article on Jorge Luis Borges’ new book. He is making his presentation today at London Public Library and blab blab blab…
I forgot about the panic attack. In fact, all memories of that morning had dissipated then and there.
The thrill of seeing Master Borges again, nine years later, was surreal. Moments later I was sitting in a cab on my way to the London Public Library, scribbling all possible questions I should be asking him. El Informe de Brodie? Other books? Forget it! I knew very well what I would ask.
I paid the cab and galloped up the marble stairs leading to the hallway, where the Master was about to hold his new book presentation. I elbowed myself through the crowd of journalists to occupy the coveted front-row spot. Quick inventory check: wallet, j-sack along with the omni-present Swiss knife. Seconds ticked leisurely on my wristwatch. Four more minutes.
Forget this morning’s sickness. Forget bloody Dr. Patel and his white pills. Collect yourself, Fernandez Augustin!
* * * * * *
“Navaro! That’s your last name, isn’t it?”
“Yes… yes Senor Borges… But how do you -”
“Nine years ago, in Cordoba. Do you not remember? I said to you that we would meet again.”
I nodded rapidly completely forgetting he couldn’t see me. Stupid.
“Perhaps,” continued Borges, “it would be more prudent for us to speak privately after the conference. I invite you to have coffee with me. I shall see you precisely at 6 o’clock at the address that my assistant will provide.”
His blind eyes were still affixed at the top far corner of the hallway, far above all the congested sharp-penciled critics and arduous followers of his divine writing. The attention was now all on me, as revealed by hundreds of photo cameras flashing from every direction.
I thought of all the explaining that I would have to do tomorrow. How does Borges know you? Are you friends? You were raised in Cordova, are you his illegitimate son? 
Back then I did not know.
Answers came later.

Memory is a tricky animal. As I gaze over the valley and satiate my lungs with familiar smells, I cannot think of anything specific. Vague and elusive memories of my childhood home. And these orchards, these white chapels and the old town itself – nothing but an incomprehensible sensation somewhere down there, below the chest cage.
I close my eyes and let the sun twirl around with tinted specks of mosaic light. I am trying to focus without looking. Alas, nothing comes to mind. I’ve been robbed of my memory. You!
I cast my eyes at the trail again. He is closing in. It’s hard for him to walk upward, and yet I see that determination in his eyes, in his tight grip of that wobbly walking stick, in the way he periodically stops to catch his breath and eyeball the remaining distance. I am not going anywhere. Five? Ten more minutes? Come and take me, old man. If you can.
I almost see his facial expression under the heavily pronounced frontal lobe. It’s a grin. It’s an expression that says: “we shall see.”
* * * * * *
Once I read an interview in “The Morning Times”. In it, Borges was portrayed as extremely humble and minimalistic. His house was depicted as a perfectly organized space with easy access to everything. Books on the shelves (judging from the admiration of the columnist, there were lots of them) were organized by theme and by title. Dictionaries and encyclopedias were grouped together on the same rack, so he could find them easily.
In another article, dated 1966, I read that when Borges travels, and those travels were quite extensive, he carries a whole rack of books along, some of which may not even be read.
When I entered his hotel room, that very bookrack was the first thing that caught my eye. I stood perplexed at the multitude of titles, most unknown to me, when I heard the door swing wide open, and there he was entering through the doorway with a leisurely swinging cane.
“Ahh Senor Navaro, how kind of you to visit this old man!”
I took a step towards him and produced some gibberish like “pleasure is all but mine”. He half-smiled and pointed his hand to the chair.
“I know you will quite enjoy the taste of Colombian dark roast.”
Borges sat down and leaned slightly backwards, without releasing his cane.
“Do you know the biggest advantage of being blind?” He asked and answered immediately. “Blind people don’t require light, so my utility bills are way lower.”
He chuckled at his own joke only to be interrupted by his assistant carrying a tray of aromatic coffee poured in two small porcelain cups. Amazing how the very idea of drinking coffee instantly changes your mood before you even take your first sip.
As I was readying to go on a pre-scripted monologue of expressing my gratitude and honour, Borges jumped right into the action.
“I will get right to it, Senor Navaro. About you being here and about me remembering you. I know you have many questions. I will attempt to answer some. Some, but not all. When you leave this hotel, there will still be some questions that you will have to find answers to. On your own.”
He gently picked his cup of coffee and with hand somewhat shaking, took an artistic sip. Yes, I had questions. So many that my brain membranes were buzzing in bewilderment and disbelief. Here I was, sitting in the room with one of the greatest writers, who happened to mysteriously not only remember me from nine years ago, but also invite me over. I had far more questions than my average mind could process. As if sensing my mental state of confusion, Borges unhurriedly took a sip from his cup, then turned his blind gaze towards me.
“Have you by any chance read my ‘The Book of Imaginary Beings’?” asked Borges.
I have. Many times. I read it in Spanish, when it just came out. Very recently I bought the English translation in some shabby bookstore off Oxford Circus. I read that book far too many times, but never in its entirety, mostly starting on a random page just as Borges had intended it to be consumed by his readers.
“You see, Senor Navaro, that book was, and perhaps still is, a never-ending work in progress as human imagination has no boundaries. I have included what I had researched over ten years ago, then recently expanded and republished with more figments of collective human imagination. But the book is merely a small subset. In a way, the book writes itself. In some form, it’s a labyrinth, an endless one, a living one, where every corridor and every room is never the same. What I had always wanted is the book to reflect the labyrinth in our collective sub consciousness, the force that drives our minds to craft. For that reason, all the creatures in my book are strictly fictional. Mythical. Am I not boring you?”
“Not at all. I understand, Senor Borges.”
He nodded and wiped a coffee grind off his nose.
“That book, as its title implies, is all about imaginary beings. Tales, legends, folklore. But one thing that no one knows is that I had originally intended this book to include one more being. A being that goes by its Latin name Quietus Est. It appeared and disappeared across many cultures, sometimes centuries apart. Very little is known of it, but what I found was indeed astonishing. First, this being is physically no different than an ordinary human. You may say, it is human in many ways. As I studied this entity, I became more and more agitated. I could not stop. Like a madman, I was trying to learn more and more, but very soon the excitement turned into another feeling. Fear.”
“Fear of what, Senor Borges?”
Borges eyesight shifted from the corner of the room straight on me, as if he could perfectly see me.
“Fear of what I had uncovered. That Quietus Est is not a myth at all.”
He attempted to take another sip, but his hands started shaking, so he had to put the cup down, spilling some of it on the saucer and around the table.
“Pardon me young man, I am trying to maintain composure. But you have not tried the coffee,” he said and wiped his mouth with a knitted handkerchief.
I raised the small cup and took a sip. Fumes of Colombian beans drifted down my internal gorges, briefly loosening all rabid brain muscles.
“Excuse me Senor Borges,” I said and put the cup down, “you are saying that Quietus Est was not imaginary. Is that why you decided not to include him in your book of imaginary beings?”
“Only in part,” said Borges. “Fear came from realization of what it would mean for mankind to know about its existence. You see… it’s no secret that we are all aware about our eventual demise. We all die. But imagine what would happen if we all stared right into the face of death every single day of our lives and knew the time that was left for us in this world. Death not as a vague concept portrayed by medieval artists, not as a folklore tale of a grim reaper. But as a real living entity that stalks you and walks around showing you a ticking clock counting down minutes and seconds. Getting closer to you with every moment to wind those hands of the clock forward. Running from death is worse than the death itself.”
He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“But I shall talk no more. Allow me to give you my scribbles from years ago. These are unedited in their raw format, so please pardon the poor language. It’s right there, in the drawer of that desk to my left. Inside you will find a folder with a piece of paper. Open it. Read it aloud, while my ripe old body attempts to catch a breath.”
I opened the drawer, as he instructed, and found a yellow piece of cursive hand writings carved in Spanish with some Latin phrases. The scribbles were short, less than a page long with marks and scratches, barely readable. He must have written this himself half-blind, I speculated. But why? What caused Senor Borges to write on his own with no eyesight instead of relying on his assistant?
I unfolded the paper and began reading:
Quietus Est
It is said that one shall not know about its own ways and times of demise. The imminent passing is only felt by those that are either terminally ill, and even so they don’t possess the knowledge of when and where, or by death row inmates awaiting the exact day and time of their execution. Lack of such knowledge coerces us to exist. 
In the times of the great Sumerian civilization, some four and a half thousand years before the birth of Christ, there are mentions of a certain mysterious deity (the word “deity” was scratched and replaced with “demon of death embodied in human flesh and bones”, which again was scratched and replaced with “entity”). It had a sole role – a malevolent one – to stalk its victims and inform them of how much time they have left to live. Not much else was known about it for any subsequent record has either been lost or destroyed – no mentions in neither Akkadian nor Babylonian scriptures that followed.
The deity (the word “deity” was again crossed out, replaced by “demon”, then “entity”) is next depicted on tomb inscriptions, but this time over a thousand kilometers away in Egypt. Some paintings during the times of the Third Dynasty portray a figure changing the course of the sun above the sundial gnomon, purportedly attempting to shorten the lifespan of a human. 
Per the ancient “Book of Dead”, which was discovered as set of clay tablets buried in corpses, only those that are “luminous” can see that deity (“entity”). The “luminous” ones are thought to be either people with high spiritual powers or vice versa, the cursed ones, condemned by priests. The reference briefly reappears in some Egyptian manuscripts, but in later writings is replaced by Anubis or – in rare occurrences – by Horus. The writings again depict this unnamed being as an eternal human who never sleeps, but always wanders. 
The peculiarity was that neither Sumerians nor Egyptians ever gave the entity a discrete name, however rare findings during Dark Ages refer to it as “Quietus Est”. From time to time Quietus Est stalks the chosen one and, when cornered, moves hands of the clock forward to shorten the lifetime. If the chosen one cannot escape, then his time eventually runs out.   The very last reference was found in –
“Enough Mr. Navaro,” said Borges. “I think you understand the idea. Now on to the main question. The question that you’ve had all along, I am sure, but were too polite to ask. Why are you here?”
He drew closer, and a dull shadow from a lamp cut right through his elongated forehead.
“Quietus Est is an eternal wanderer who is always with us. The timekeeper who sits at the edge of the stage with a ticking watch on his wrist. The greatest gift given to mankind is inability to see him. When I lost sight, I thought blindness was a blessing in disguise. But luminous ones shall not require eyes to see the wanderer. What eyes cannot see, ears can hear, skin can feel. I hear him. I feel him. Mr. Navaro, you are here because you and I are the luminous ones…”
Borges paused and asked me with a trembling voice, “Mr. Navaro, please tell me. You have faced him too, have you not?”
Cold shivers that have been accumulating in my lower back dashed up my spinal cord. Nausea formed a massive ball of air in my throat, and for a moment I struggled to breathe. Desperately trying to cease the thumping inside, I pushed words out.
“Yes, Senor Borges. I have. Today.”
* * * * * *
How do you get used to the notion of being a passerby on this Earth? Ordinary humans do not have to get used to that. We have that built-in protection layer, that safety cork in our brain membranes that separates the realization of being mortal from flooding down upon us. It allows us to breathe the air. It lets us exhibit this extraordinary, yet sacred carelessness. The mental block that denies the laws of life on a primitive emotional level even for the keenest scholars. The indecipherable Tetragrammaton is shown to us in every step we take, in every cup of Colombian coffee we sip, in every word of wisdom that we collect from books. Every second we bypass the sinister tick-tock and hear the name of the God being whispered into our ears. And yet we, humans, turn around and whistle “Shame Shame”, deceiving our own self-cognizance. And that, as Senor Borges called it, is the true blessing.  Those who possess the name of the divine being are doomed. Knowledge is madness. Knowledge is inexistence. Knowledge of death is worse than death.
I sat with Borges until early morning, the two luminous and doomed souls in a quiet hotel room. Our casual exchange of words was amplified by the ticking of the clock. It was dawning, when I noticed Borges dosing off. His left hand was still resting on the cane and his pupils were shuffling behind shut eyelids.
Borges was dreaming.
So must have I.
I put on my jacket and left, quietly closing the door behind. As I was exiting the foyer of the hotel, I hid behind one of the columns and surveyed the street. Bleak light of streetlamps drew strange crossbeams on pavements. Early October leaves were gyring in closed circles like witches around the fire.
I was looking around, hoping to not see him.
He wasn’t there. But he was.
* * * * * *
Muscat orchards – they resonate inside like echoes of a guitar string heard from a deep alcove, but nothing comes to mind. I am trying to shift focus from one object to another, but my nomad memory is lost in endless labyrinths. You have taken away my memories, haven’t you?
Wait, mortal. Wait five more minutes, and you will know the answer, I hear in my head. He is talking to me now. I can see how the long uphill walk is wearing him out. But what is pain and tiredness when you’re crossing the finish line?
As Borges warned me, “do not ever come close to him. Do not look him straight in the eyes. He will always be near. His watch will be ticking. If he attempts to catch on, run. But he will forever follow. In a way, he will be like a shadow of you.”
And I ran. And he wandered. I evaded. He followed.
He came too close to me in my hotel room on the second day after my long night in Borges’ quarters. The fool in me still thought that escaping from him would be as easy as moving into a new flat. Or checking into a hotel. So, the fool in me did just that.
It was some shabby hotel minutes from my office. I decided to spend a few nights there just to think things through – to put life on pause.
That evening – and I remember every minute of it – was my first face-to-face encounter with him. My room, B6, was on the basement level. As I walked down one flight of stairs, stumbled through the hotel corridor, trying to find the key to my room, I felt his presence. It was that same feeling I had in that square, the inexplicable sense of primordial fear. Did I turn around and run? I wanted to, but my ignorant foolishness – still not fully sold on what I thought back then was lunacy of an old man – pressed on. So, I walked to my room and turned the key in the lock.
As the door hinge squeaked, I took my first step into my hotel room. Street level window was casting two thick yellow streaks of light on the floor carpet. I smelled dust and spider webs.
He was waiting for me, sitting on the edge of the bed. He had a blanket covering his head like a shroud around a statue, and in his hand, he held a rope. I stood in stupor like a paralyzed insect. An avalanche of sweat gushed from every pore of my body. He got up from the bed with a groan. He took a step towards me.
Hand too sweaty to turn the knob. Open it. Open!
He grabbed my wrist.
For the love of God, Fernandez Augustin Navaro, open the door and run away!
The stretched corridor of the hotel basement flashed like random shots of a silent movie. B5. B2. B1. Run! Staircase. Up! Exit! Run!
“Your time is coming, Fernandez Augustin Navaro!” a whisper crawled into my ears. “coming… coming…” rhymed the wind.
I ran until my legs gave in. I collapsed somewhere in the outskirts of the town, passing out in an alley amidst rubbish until sunup.
My madness has begun.
In the days following my first face-to-face encounter with Quietus Est, I’ve moved out of my London flat and became a vagrant. I had some savings, enough to tramp town to town, continent to continent, doing temp jobs here and there, sometimes sleeping on streets, never staying in the same place for more than a couple of weeks.
My chaser was behind me. Sometimes I wouldn’t see him for months, but eventually he would catch on, and the chase would go on. It would be only a matter of time for him to pop up somewhere – on the opposite side of the street, in the next car over on the subway, or madly prying through shutters of windows in the house across.
My attempts to speak to Borges were futile. How does the blind master live with this “luminous” damnation, I wondered. How does he manage to evade his sinister follower?
I had questions. Far more than I had anticipated. But Senor Borges was already on the other side of the globe. I wrote him letters – he never replied. I tried calling hotels where he stayed – unavailable.
The books that he wrote, I bought all of them in attempts to find hidden meanings. What if he had secret messages for me inside his writings? “The Book of Sand”, “Dr. Brodie’s Report”. I even searched his earlier writings, analyzed every word. Pointless and futile.
Until –
* * * * * *
1983. “Shakespeare’s Memory”. His final book, as it turned out to be.
I was somewhere in Eastern Europe when I saw the book displayed in a window of some corner bookstore. Immediately I began my scrupulous study. Letter by letter, page by page, analyzing every space and every punctuation sign.
The answer came when I least expected. Simple and evident as daylight, the answer was the story itself. The story that did not require much study or decryption. All I had to do was read it. I knew I had to come face to face with Quietus Est like Borges did, but not before having to go through the life of an exile. That’s what Borges had intended me to do. Such was his final and only message to me embodied within his final story.
In the story the protagonist receives memories of William Shakespeare. Memories overwhelm him in such a way that they overpower his own memories. He forgets modern day cars and engines, instead remembering faces and names from some distant past. Memories that belonged to another man.
“In a way, he will be like a shadow of you,” Borges told me that night.
Slowly but surely, my shadow was becoming me. That’s why I can only vaguely remember you, my childhood home.
It’s either him or me. No more running. It ends here. There he is.
* * * * * *
There he is. He is out of breath. Beaten, tired and bent by the weight of his own arid body. One last push, old man, and we will meet.
I am hiding behind the rock, listening to the impending sound of his footsteps, heavy and forced. Listening to his breathing, wheezing and crackling. I know them by heart – his footsteps and his breathing. By heart from my nightmares.
I am counting to five.
He knows where I am, but he is too tired to take that last step. Let me take that step for you. And I stand straight. No more hiding. He sees me now.
I am staring at his face, wrinkled like pages of an ancient scroll.
“Time’s up, Quietus Est,” I tell him and grab him by the throat.
He is not fighting back, and my Swiss blade finds a comfy spot below his Adam’s apple. I am going to finish him now.
Popping sounds are coming out from his flabby throat. What are you trying to tell me, old man? Let me hear your last words. I am easing the pressure to let him talk. But the sounds that come out are not words, but laughter.
“You… you are confused,” he says between coughs. “You’ve got it all wrong. Let me… Let me help you understand.”
I am letting him sit up. One wrong move, and he’s dead. He wipes blood and phlegm off his chin and nods in understanding.
“All my life I have followed you,” he begins slowly. “It’s a miracle I have come this far and lived this long. Ever since I left Cordoba, I was a ticking time bomb. I was diagnosed as suicidal. Doctor after doctor, therapies, specialists, prescription, yoga – I have tried them all. Some helped for a while, and the disease subsided, but then trolled back with a more frenetic wave. It’s this disease that nests here” – and he points to his head – “forcing me to look for ways to end my own life. It all began in London, on that morning when I was sitting on the bench in the middle of that square, feeling the disease gnawing on my brain. I closed my eyes and imagined you. I asked you to come, and you came – right from around the corner of the square. I stood up, and I walked to you. But you ran away. I looked for you, and I found your home, but you were not there. Then I checked into a hotel. Room B6, you remember it, don’t you? I sat on the bed and waited. I had a rope in my hand and a blanket over my head. I called for Death, I called it into my room to come and end me, to hang me on that rope or slash my throat. Death opened the door and stood above me in the darkness of the room. Oh, how I wanted my pain to end! But it was not meant to be. Not then, not there. I had to live on. Ever since that day, it was a cat and a mouse game. I chased, but Death would always slip away. Until now.”
He pauses, rubbing his flabby neck, then points his finger down the valley and continues: “You see that house? I was born there. I remember every moment of my childhood. My parents, my toys, my friends, my school. I remember playing hide and seek with my cousins in Muscat gardens and dosing off to Sunday clergy in that white chapel. I remember Eastern rugs being washed on the street and the smell of grapes. My name is Fernandez Augustin Navaro. And you – you have no true name, but they call you Quietus Est. The one who wanders.”
Filaments of scorching infernos have been ignited all over me. The fire razes hell inside eyelids, spreading over to all facial pores and trickling down the body.
“Lies! Imbecile lies!” I roar.
“Look at me,” he says, “I am an old man. And you? Still young and strong as you will always be. You have not aged. Now think more. What do you remember of your childhood? Shakespearean memories of random sounds and smells is all you have gained from me. Master Borges knew who you were. He cracked you, and then he tricked you. He made you think you were me. That was his way of evading you – by not revealing you the truth until his final breath, final book, final story. You are the one who wanders. And those memories you have – those are my memories. And now that I have told you who you really are, you must finally finish me.”
I have heard enough of his fibs. I am throwing my knife away. I shall not require any blades to finish him. With hands clinched around his thin neck, I am strangling him. I hear him squeal as the grip tightens. I feel the crackling of neck bones between my thumbs. He is gulping air in warm convulsions, but he is smiling. He looks to be finally at peace.
I sit on his chest and watch his last breath picked up by the wind, carried down the valley to the gardens, passing by the white chapel and the house where he grew up.
The scorching wind of Andalusia is pouring sunlight onto his face, toying with eyelashes, pounding on cheeks and gyring through hair. He missed the smell of the valley and the ripening softness of Muscat fluff glistening in the air.
I am rewinding my wristwatch and walking downhill along the wavy trail, my thumbs still sore from killing.
I am taking a small step sideways. Once I reach El Jardinito Road, I will hop on the first bus, and from there I will travel west. Or north. Destination will never matter.
Anywhere is where the roads take me. Me, the one who wanders."	9.0	18.0	Simon Simonian	01/24/2017
Turn It Off	"I rested my arms behind my head, skim-reading the credits of a movie I’d just watched. After seeing them through about halfway, I lifted myself from the sofa and walked to the kitchen, stretching my arms out above me. I opened the fridge door and found a full carton of juice, so I sat down on the kitchen counter by the window, cracked open the lid, and took several long, noisy gulps. When I couldn’t drink anymore, I gasped to let in new air and wiped my mouth on the back of my hand. My evenings were uneventful around this time in summer. It was 9:15 pm on a Saturday in July, school was out for the holidays, and my parents had gone to visit my aunt and uncle who lived by the coast. They would still be gone for two more weeks. I declined the invitation to join them. I didn’t dislike the place or my relatives, but we usually stayed there so long that I’d miss most of summer break, and I’d truthfully rather spend it with my friends in town. I was a good kid who knew how to wash clothes and use an oven, and was, generally speaking, not an idiot, so they let me stay at the house so long as I kept it clean.
As I sat, I looked out into the garden to check for anything scary in the dark, it was empty and black. I kind of wished we had a pet, a dog or a cat would be nice about now, but their hair always made me sneeze and my eyes go red and itchy. With that in mind, my dad said no, even though I wouldn’t mind it. 9:22 pm, I put the rest of the juice carton back in the fridge door, and went back over to the window. Hoisting myself onto the counter again, I glanced out to the garden and identified the shadows one by one to make sure everything was in its place. The bushes were their usual shape, two small trees stood together by the back fence and a metal table with four chairs sat casually on the patio. I liked to check these things, which is largely why I wasn’t scared of the dark. I would always get up to investigate small noises in the night, and I hated sleeping with my face to the wall. If someone was in my room at night, I’d rather know about it so at least there was the faintest chance of getting away somehow. This meant that my worries were quickly put to rest as I either found nothing downstairs but the radiator popping with the heat, or opened my eyes to see an empty bedroom. Not knowing what could be making the odd noises coming from the kitchen, or on the stairs, or in my room is what makes my skin creep.
At 9:30 pm, I got down from the counter and wandered back into the living room to turn off the TV, and decided to take the rest of the juice upstairs. I went back into the kitchen, opened the fridge door, and stopped. Turning my head to focus outside, I could see someone was standing in the garden. I shut the fridge door and turned off the light so they couldn’t see me so easily, and moved slowly to lean on the kitchen counter to get a better look. All the doors were locked and all the neighbors were home, I took a moment to remind myself this. Still, my heart quickened a bit as I stood there straining to see his or her shape in the darkness at the end of the garden. I had to keep glancing away to keep their fuzzy outline clear in my vision. They were standing very still and were a little thin, but that’s all I could see. I couldn’t tell anything else.
“Oh,” I said aloud. It was the garden umbrella leaning up against the back fence; I forgot that we used it for barbeques. I smiled at myself, pleased that I didn’t get too worked up and went upstairs to my bedroom. I lay on the bed and propped my head up on a pillow, opening my laptop on my stomach to see if anybody was online. Apparently someone else was bored and saw my name pop up.
Chris: Hey!
Me: Hey, you okay?
Chris: Yeah, bored, are your parents still away?
Me: For a couple more weeks.
Chris: Why don’t I come round?
Me: I don’t want to be rude, but I kind of can’t be bothered to hang out tonight *laughs out loud* Thanks, though.
Chris: I know what you mean, it’s cool. What about tomorrow?
Me: Yeah that sounds better.
Chris: Cool, I’ll be around about one o’clock. I’ve got some family stuff to do in the morning.
Me: Okay.
Chris: Do you still have a tent, by the way? We can camp in the garden or something.
Me: Aww, a slumber party. I love you too, bro.
Chris: Whatever *laughs out loud*  You got the tent, though?
Me: Yeah, somewhere. Let me check. Be right back.
I got up from my bed and headed to check the cupboard under the stairs. I didn’t know where the tent was but it seemed a good place to start. I opened the cupboard door and started shifting coats aside, some cardboard boxes were stacked up at the back and might be hiding it, so I started un-stacking them. I took out a couple of the easy to reach ones and had a stroke of good luck as the tent bag came into view. I leaned over the other boxes, and picked up the bag, and took the big garden umbrella that sat beside it too, just in case it rained tomorrow. I paused. I put the tent down.
It took me a couple of seconds to get back to the kitchen window and focus on the darkness outside. My eyes weren’t yet adjusted to the dark, so I couldn’t see all the way to the back fence. Turning off the kitchen light I leaned on the counter and continued staring at the same point. The other garden features began to fade into view one by one, fitting my previous mental image. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to see, the darkness gave way to the familiar forms I knew, but after a while, I was certain there still stood a figure against the back garden fence. It hadn’t moved. I stood there for 15 minutes looking at it, I couldn’t tell its shape properly, but it did look like someone standing there. I decided it wasn’t a threat; I thought if I was in any real danger I would’ve been a lot more worried by now, that thought kept me calm. But I also wanted to find out what it was. I couldn’t stand there forever. I jogged upstairs, picked up my laptop, and brought it down to with me to the counter.
Me: Could you come round now?
Chris: Oh?
Me: Yeah, I think I can see something in my garden.
Chris: What is it? An animal?
Me: No, it’s tall. I thought it was an umbrella.
Chris: And now you’re sure it isn’t?
Me: I don’t know, I thought it was someone, but now I’m sure it’s not a person. It just looks weird and I don’t think it was there before.
Chris: Before when?
Me: I don’t know, earlier today maybe? I can’t remember.
Chris: Are you scared?
Me: I’d feel better if someone else was here.
Chris: Well, I did offer to come round, and I am bored…
Me: So, yeah?
Chris: Yeah, I’ll come soon.
Me: Cool, thanks. Use the front gate.
I sat there watching the black shape lean against the fence for another 10 minutes. Eventually, the doorbell rang. I opened it, and Chris ran in and bear-hugged me.
“It’s been too long!” Chris mock-cried.
“Yeah, it must have been a whole day,” I retorted, smiling.
“The torment!” he replied, pretending to ignore me.
“Look, come over here,” I said, pushing him off and walking to the kitchen. I switched off the light and pointed in the figure’s direction. “Look.”
“Give me a sec,” said Chris. “I can’t see properly…” A minute later he noticed. “That black thing?”
“Yea.h”
“Um…”
We both stood there looking at it for a while. I half-expected it to be gone when he looked. He leaned over the counter.
“It’s just a big plant, or a plank of wood or something. Let’s go watch TV.”
“Will you check with me to make sure?” I asked.
“Do you have a flashlight?” he replied.
“No,” I admitted.
“Well, we could check if we keep the kitchen light on and open the back door a little,” he offered. I thought for a second and agreed, but said we should stay right by the house.
We slipped on our trainers and opened the back door, stepping onto the patio I felt the air was heavy and warm that night. Chris walked behind me. We stood very close to the door, peering at the back fence.
“Should we-”
I had just started to speak when he quickly stepped into the house again, still looking at the fence.
“What?” I asked following him in. I turned, and realized that the figure was gone. It was obvious from the light coming from the back door that the fence and the rest of the garden were just as they had always been.
“Where is it?” Chris asked.
“If it was leaning against the fence, it probably fell over into a bush or something,” I tried to convince us both. We stared out for a few seconds longer, and then decided that we were too nervous to go and check. I don’t usually give into my night terrors, but now they were just beginning to click into my head.
“Can you stay over for the night?” I asked Chris.
“Um, yeah, sure…” It didn’t sound like he really wanted to. He kept his eyes on the fence.
We both went inside and locked the door before going up to my room. I got out a sleeping bag for Chris, and drew the curtains without looking outside into the garden again. We talked about stupid stuff for a couple of hours to take our minds off the garden, and fell asleep.
* * * * * *
In the morning, I found Chris’s sleeping bag empty. I called out to Chris and he said he was downstairs, so I threw on a T-shirt and went down.
“Sleep well?” I asked.
“Yeah, pretty well,” he said, “but I kept thinking about the garden and stuff. Hey, did you find that tent?”
“Erm, yeah,” I answered, remembering that shape which I had forgotten about until now. “Well, I was thinking about the camping thing, and thought maybe we could bring the tent to my house. It would just make for a change, you know?” I didn’t have to ask him why; I wasn’t too keen on staying in my garden after last night. Wait. Last night… Come to think of it, the sun was up and I wanted to check the garden while it wasn’t pitch black. I asked Chris and he hesitantly agreed.
We put on our trainers and stepped out into the garden. I don’t know what we were so worried about, it was bright and colorful. The plants and bushes around the edges of the garden smelled good, and there was a bird in one of the small trees singing out for its mate somewhere. We walked to the back fence to find nothing out of place, and looked over the bushes in front of the paneling to check if anything lay behind them. We found nothing. I walked around the edge of the whole garden once more while Chris tried whistling to the bird. It cocked its head from side to side trying to figure him out. It was a warm day, perfect for camping that evening, I decided.
We talked as we filled a couple of rucksacks with sleeping bags and some food from the kitchen. We didn’t want to set up a fire, so we packed some tinned hot dogs, bread, a packet of tomatoes, and chocolate, as well as some bottles of water. “There’s a forest just next to my house which is actually pretty good,” Chris explained “Our garden backs onto the edge of it. I stayed in a tent there once with my dad for my first little camping trip when I was like, 7. I remember I was so excited at the time, I thought we were really roughing it like some hardcore mountaineers.” Chris laughed at himself. “If we get too cold or need more food we can just go to my house. My parents are out so we’ll have free run of the place anyway.”
“Yours are away, too?” I questioned.
“It’s their anniversary so they’re out for the night,” he explained. “They’re staying in a hotel the next town over. They’ll be back in the morning.” Apparently leaving your kids behind was in fashion this summer.
At about noon we left my house with the 2 rucksacks, a sleeping bag for each of us, and the tent, and made our way to Chris’s house. It was fairly close by, and a part of the same pleasant neighborhood. We talked and joked a lot, walking side by side, nodding to and greeting a couple of familiar neighbors as we went. It was a crazy nice day, the sun was almost too much, it was hot on our necks, and the trees by the sidewalk seemed to glow green from underneath as the sunlight passed through the leaves. A sprinkler offered us some water as we walked by one house, and it felt good on my hot arms. I was already sweating by the time we got to Chris’s place. We hadn’t been walking for more than 20 minutes. We didn’t go inside his house immediately because it was so hot, so we went straight to his garden and dumped our bags in the shade. He wasn’t joking, the gate of his garden backed straight onto an impressive forest. Very tall, thin trees stood high above the house, and continued as far as I could see. Some bushes and shrubs littered the forest floor, but most of it was either grass, or fairly smooth sections of dirt. I didn’t see how this forest was classed as “small”.
“Looks good right?” he boasted.
“It’s awesome,” I admitted, opening the gate and surveying the area. I walked out in between the trees and found a flat spot for the tent. I turned around to ask Chris’s opinion, and paused, a little disappointed. It didn’t feel like real camping when his house was so obviously in our faces.
“Let’s go a little further in so it at least feels legit.” I said, and walked back to pick up my bags, Chris objected to carrying his “heavy shit” any further. We walked in a straight line from Chris’s house, and kept checking behind us until the house was just about obscured by trees in front of each other. We had only gone a very short way in but the forest was already thicker and greener, there was even a long rope swing hanging from one of the trees, but it looked too old to hold our weight, so we decided to keep our spines unbroken and give it a miss. I unpacked the tent and set it up with Chris’s help, and we threw our sleeping bags inside. I lay down inside to test it out. It was so warm and humid I had to adjust my breathing for a second. I stepped out again, and asked Chris if he had a flashlight for the evening.
“I can do better than that.” was his response and he took off towards the house. I was too hot to run after him, so I opened my rucksack and cracked open a bottle of water, downing half of it and putting the rest back in the pack. I Laid down on a patch of grass and looked up at the canopy. The leaves were shifting gently in a breeze I couldn’t feel from down here, and I watched them sway and mesh together until I heard Chris return.
“Did you get a flashlight?” I asked, closing my eyes. The sun shone through my eyelids and colored my vision red. I listened to the soft sound of his footsteps on the grass as he walked past me towards the rope swing. “That’s not going to hold you,” I warned as I heard him tug the branch with a small creak. He tugged it and it creaked in response. I listened. He tugged it once more, and again. There was a moment of silence as I guessed he was still weighing it up, and then another tug. He continued to tug a few more times, and the creaking followed each one. I was sure it wouldn’t hold his weight, and I smiled, predicting one big creak and a snap as the rope or the branch broke. I waited as some final tugs were made. Creak, creak. I waited still. Creak, creak, creak.
“Yo!” I heard Chris’s voice coming from his garden, I sat bolt upright almost spraining my neck as I snapped my head sideways to face his house. He was jogging through the trees holding an electric lantern. I switched my gaze in the other direction towards the rope swing. It was hanging still, nothing nearby. I stood up and turned full circle, nothing in any other direction.
“What…” I mouthed to myself walking towards the rope. I tugged it gently, it didn’t creak. I pulled it harder, it didn’t creak. My mouth went dry. I jumped up, grabbed hold, and yanked it down. The branch bent a little as my feet touched the floor, and still it didn’t make a sound. I kept hold of it as I stared up towards the branches, but eventually the rope gave way under my weight somewhere in the middle, and a soft thud fell on my ears as the thick rope fell in front of me. Chris was rattling the lantern as he came by.
“I’ve never used this before. I got it for Christmas from my cousin. She buys some weird presents. Ah, I see the swing is dead, let’s have a proper burial in memory of all the joy it gave us!” I didn’t respond. I continued looking up at the branch with half a rope swing tied to it.
“Hey, are you good?” Chris followed my gaze.
“I thought you’d already come back,” I said immediately. I wasn’t the type to let things slide with an, “Oh… it’s nothing.”
“What?” he replied.
“Someone walked by me and was messing around with the rope swing.”
“Who was it?”
“I don’t know.”
“Are they still around?”
“I don’t know! I had my eyes closed and was lying right there.” I pointed. “But then I heard you shout, so I looked around and there was nothing here. I heard them walk by my head.” I felt a bit sick.
“Look, calm down a second,” Chris began. “It’s the middle of the day, we’re 30 feet from my house, and even if it was a person, so what? It’s just some public woods. Anyone can come through here.”
That made some sense, and he was right about it being public. But then where were they? I glanced around one more time. However, the trees quickly layered up and I couldn’t see far at all. I guessed it was possible for me to lose track of someone here in a short distance.
“Okay,” I said. “Man… I can stay alone in the house for weeks on end, but I can’t handle a short walk through the woods on a summer day.”
“That’s why you’ve brought some muscle!” declared Chris, wielding the lantern above his head, and I laughed.
We spent the day walking around the forest, and returned to the tent to get some water when we were too hot. We talked about school and what our plans were for the future. We talked about dreams we’d had, and ghosts, and creatures that lurked in the dark. Neither of us was too scared of things like that, but they made for good camping stories. Chris told a particularly good one of a woman who lived in the woods. She had the head of a cat and if you heard her raspy meow, that meant she was trying to find you. If she stopped meowing, it signified you were found, and she was quickly making her way towards you. It made my skin crawl a little, and we stopped telling stories soon after that.
The light of day eventually faded, and it was getting hard to see, so we headed back to the tent for the night. The impressive heat during the day had killed our appetites, so we left the food for now and decided we’d eat it in the night if we got hungry. Chris hung the electric lantern at the front of the tent, flicking it on as he did so. It was surprisingly bright, and spilled a yellow light onto the ground and onto the trees that faced us. The warm glow looked dramatic, but whatever was beyond the light was hidden in blackness. Our immediate area was clear, but after a few paces, the light seemed to stop dead. It looked weird. Chris ducked under the tent opening and I followed him. The sleeping bags looked inviting as the heat from earlier had gone and it was too cold for shirts and shorts. We got inside and took the lantern with us.
“Can you hear meowing?” I said, my head tilted as I strained to hear.
“Yeah, I can hear some bullshit too!” Chris smiled and zipped up his sleeping bag. Damn, I thought I had him, oh well, I zipped up my own bag and we laid there talking for a little while, and then the exhaustion of such a hot summer’s night hit us and we fell asleep.
I had a dream that we were walking to Chris’s house again, but there were more trees than before, and it was getting dark very quickly. I blinked, and suddenly it was night, with the forest sprawling in every direction. The rope swing hung in front of me. I turned around and Chris was gone. I heard a creak behind me, and a feeling came over me like I’d missed a step on the stairs. For some reason, I couldn’t turn around. I started walking straight ahead, and the rope swing soon came into my view again, I was aware I was in a nightmare. The rope swing slowly lifted itself up into the trees and I watched it disappear. I walked over and stood beneath where it had been, and there was a rustle above me. As I lifted my eyes to the canopy, a black figure with the head of a cat came hurtling downwards with its mouth open horrifically wide, one of its teeth touched my left eye, and I tore myself awake, gasping as I sat up in the tent. My back was damp with sweat and Chris was asleep next to me, the lantern was still on and I could see our backpacks at the end of the tent. I took a moment to breathe and then let myself lay back down, my head thumping on the floor a little too hard. I winced and reached for the bottle of water to my side, downing a few mouthfuls. I couldn’t fall asleep with the glow of the lantern on my eyelids, so I sat up and searched the tent for it. I quickly realized the light was coming from outside.
“Chris?” I said, still confused from sleep. He mumbled something in reply. “Chris, where’s the lantern?”
“Uh… Somewhere….” he said slowly and sleepily, before turning over.
Looking around again, the light was obviously coming from outside. I weighed up the options. Either some murderer had snuck into our tent and done nothing but take the lantern outside. Or, we didn’t actually bring it into the tent and I had remembered wrongly. That sounded more convincing. So I knelt by the tent door and unzipped it. From the opening I looked around, it wasn’t immediately obvious where the glow was coming from. Why couldn’t I see it? I looked up. The lantern was resting 20 feet in the air, hanging in the dark. Goosebumps swept across my skin and I zipped up the door before shaking Chris.
“Chris, please wake up!” He heard the urgency in my voice and sat up.
“What? What’s wrong?” Chris said, rubbing his eyes.
“The lantern’s hanging outside.”
“But I brought it in,” he assured me. I felt sick as my reasoning broke. We both looked at the front of the tent.
“We should go back to the house,” I said, my resolve buckling. I was just a kid in a forest whose parents were away.
“I’m not walking through the dark,” he replied, Chris was now looking worried.
“We’ve got a lantern-” I stopped myself. We looked at the front of the tent again. We couldn’t sit there forever. We were getting scared as we sat there doing nothing, so this was the plan; we weren’t going back to sleep, we would get the lantern back somehow, leave everything here, and spend the night in Chris’s house.
I hated being the one to go first. I wanted to turn back even just crouching by the tent entrance. Unzipping the fabric door I looked around, nothing. I peered over the tent behind us, nothing in sight. Literally nothing, everything was black outside of the light. I took a step out and it was cold, Chris said the same as he stood right by my side looking over his shoulder. He turned back and saw the lantern in the air.
“Oh, my god.”
We stood there looking at it for a few seconds that seemed to crawl by. Eventually, I worked out which tree it was hanging from, the broken rope swing at my feet confirmed it. Way up out of reach, the lantern hung above our heads, tied to the other end of the rope that still dangled from the darkness. I couldn’t work it out. It was high up, too high up for even a ladder. The trees were thin and bare besides the leaves that made up the canopy. There was nowhere to climb.
Picking up the length of rope that had snapped off earlier, I bundled it up and tied a knot, and aimed at the lantern. I took a step back and jumped, tossing it into the air. It caught the lantern on its side and sent it swinging. It threw shadows rocking around us; I suddenly wished it hadn’t hit it. The light made the shadows lean from side to side with the lantern. The horrible, unnatural swaying made me panic and my eyes became wet as fear took a solid hold of me. I picked up the rope again, and lobbed it desperately at the lantern. I missed, and the bundle of rope sailed off into the darkness. Helplessly I turned to Chris who had already grabbed his backpack. He spun around and threw it with a yelp, and it hit the lantern dead on. It fell and thudded to the floor with a crack, but the light was still on. I ran to pick it up.
I turned to Chris and almost cried with relief.
“Okay, go, go, go! Let’s go!” I urged, and he started jogging quickly towards his house as I followed. We half ran, half stumbled off into the dark, checking over our shoulders and working ourselves up as our thoughts were consumed by everything that may be waiting in the trees for us. I don’t know how long we were moving, but it soon became apparent that Chris’s house wasn’t in this direction.
“For God’s sake, where is it?!” Chris said, tension taking hold of his voice. “We’ll have to find the tent and try again.” A couple of tears were forming at the corners of his eyes. They were probably on mine too, but my heart was thumping so hard I didn’t notice.
“Okay.” I took a breath and we turned around, heading in a straight line directly behind us. What if we didn’t find the tent? I couldn’t stop myself thinking that over and over as we retraced our steps. We walked for what seemed like twice as long, before the light finally fell on the side of the tent.
We ran up and stood close to its side, looking around to try and figure out which direction we should go. The silence was like the build-up of a nightmare, right before some horrible thing lurches out at you, screaming. The comparison made me gag and I scrunched my eyes shut, the hair on my skin lifting. My temples were so hot it felt like my brain was thudding against the inside of my skull. I couldn’t begin to guess where the house was. We could see about ten feet from the lantern, and then pitch black, there were no clues. Every direction looked wrong. Chris took the lantern from me and walked in a small circle, straining his eyes to try and see. I stayed put.
“Chris, Turn it off,” I whispered to him hurriedly.
“What?” He asked.
I stepped quickly and quietly towards him, bringing my face to his.
“There’s something in the tent.”
His gaze shifted past me towards the tent and he stood there staring. We were standing on the left-hand side of the tent, and from this angle, I could just about see the unzipped door hanging open, but I remembered leaving it that way. So that wasn’t what was making me clench my teeth together. A few feet away, my rucksack sat outside on the dry earth, with the food I had packed, now neatly arranged trailing from it. Our sleeping bags were also nicely laid out, end to end, making the line of belongings lead straight into the mouth of the tent. I took a careful step forward so the light could pass more easily through the fabric. It couldn’t have been a trick of the light, something big and dark was obviously crouched, with what I guessed was its front, facing the open door. I hated myself for not seeing it sooner. It didn’t move at all, or seem to breathe, it just sat, waiting for us to investigate the display it had made.
“Turn it off,” I whispered again. Chris continued staring, deaf to me.
“Chris!” I pleaded in a whisper.
A voice from nearby joined in.
“Chris.”
We both heard it and the blood fell in our veins. It came from the tent. A slow, strained, rasp of a voice that sounded like a parrot copying a new word. The sound clicked across my skin and crept into my ears. The light flicked off with a click that was too loud. Chris grabbed my shoulder, and I clenched my fists closed, painfully tight. We stood there in complete darkness, I didn’t want to move and I didn’t want to stay. My brain fought for control as my legs waited for a decision, rooted in place. We breathed shallow, quiet breaths, blackness pressing on our eyes like water. Sweat ran down my neck, I couldn’t see the tent.
“Chrisss,” something said. “Turn it offff.”
My stomach flipped inside out as the thing in the tent played with my words. I quickly grabbed Chris’s hand, yanking him in the opposite direction. I ran like I never had before, Chris’s legs thudding alternately with mine. The sprint continued for about a minute, we lost ourselves as we ran through absolute darkness. I forgot where we were and I couldn’t see what was in front of my face. I ran head-on into a tree, and my forehead struck its side with a sickening, hollow knock. Sparks lit up inside my eyes as I choked back the pain. It hurt so much I couldn’t breathe. Chris tried to pull me on, but I buckled to the floor on my knees and threw up. As I collapsed onto my back, my head went numb, Chris lifted me up.
“Please, don’t stop! Please, please!” he begged. I couldn’t reply. “Please, please, keep going!” I forced my legs to take my weight as I locked my knees upright, leaning on Chris. My body felt empty and a little blood rolled down my forehead and into my brow, I wiped it away as I tried to grasp the situation again, but the pain was too much.
“Wait, I can’t!” I begged. “Just wait, just wait…” We stood together in the inky woods, but we could have been anywhere. I couldn’t see Chris as he huddled next to me, it didn’t feel like darkness, it felt like someone had wrapped my head in a blanket.
Neither of us said a word as we waited, but our breathing was loud, and I wondered from what distance it could be heard. Reality began to return to me, and the pain was now just about bearable, I straightened up, grasping at what was happening, the pins of fear sank into me a second time, and I started counting in my head. One minute passed without any sound in the world. The wind was dead, and the birds might be too. Another minute went by, and I continued counting. Three minutes. We were still alone, was it even looking for us? I reached for Chris’s arm in the dark, he jumped when I touched it, but I steadied him with the other, he was still holding the lantern, good. We had light on our side; now, if only we could use it. I went over the events hurriedly in my mind; the lantern was hanging from a tree, we got out of the tent, and then couldn’t find our way home. By the time we returned to the tent, something was in it, but then why did it take the lantern and do nothing while we slept? If it was sheer luck that we were alone when we were trying to get the lantern, I wondered just how small the possibility was of us getting a second chance.
I stayed silent for a moment and then whispered as best I could. “Chris, we need to turn on the lantern. We need to fucking get away from here, we can make a run for your house but we need to see!”
“No, please! We have to stay here!” Chris tried to whisper, too. “We can wait for morning if we have to. You can’t turn it on.” I could hear in his voice that a sob was breaking through. “Just keep quiet! You fucking have to! Please!” I parted my lips to try again, but as I did, I heard something. A very faint clicking sound from somewhere in the dark. It was almost inaudible, but it was there. An irregular, stuttering, clicking sound. It sounded fingernails on a wooden table. And it was moving. It came from in front of us, I was sure of it. A steady “click, clack, click” filled my ears as we tried to gauge the distance. It was drawing closer. Click, click, clack. It stopped. I was glad for the first time in my life that I couldn’t see what was waiting in the dark. Perhaps that meant we were also hidden. As my thoughts fired off in every direction, I gave the thing in the darkness the image of the cat-headed woman, and it terrified me. I was just waiting to hear that meow. But my ears were met with something else.
“Chris,” I tensed my throat and tried not to cry. “Chris.”
It said his name twice, and I cupped my hand over my mouth, the horrible, scraping dialogue sounded a few steps away. The words were said oddly, with no meaning behind them. They were just sounds that this thing had picked up, and was now using them to catch us out in the dark. Chris let go of my hand and I heard his foot plant softly on the grass behind him as he prepared to run. Don’t you dare, I tried to project into his mind. Don’t you make a sound.
“Chris. Pleeease.”
It sounded so wrong, drawn out like a door slowly opening. Chris let out a whimper as it called him. I froze and waited for something, anything to happen. There was a long silence and I held my breath for as long as I could. I couldn’t wait anymore. Very slowly I reached out to Chris and put my hand on his shoulder, and very carefully we both lifted our feet and managed to step without making a sound. We back stepped away from the voice and didn’t stop moving, but ever so carefully. So, so slowly. I didn’t care how long it would take us to get somewhere. If it took us an hour every step, we were going to get out. Chris backed into a tree, and gasped audibly. The clicking started up immediately. Click-click, clack-click, it rolled on, consistently moving towards us. I didn’t know what to do. All I could think of was to screw my eyes shut and try not to scream. As we stood there, the clicking came to a stop an arm’s length away from where we stood. Silence.
“Chrisss. Turn it on. Pleeease.”
Fear took over. Chris switched on the light and tore off in the other direction without looking behind him. I wheeled in place and held that lantern in my sight like nothing else existed. We didn’t dare look at the thing, but we could hear it. Our footsteps thudded on the grass, and the thing pursued us with a “tap-tap-tap-tap”, now like scurrying little claws on hard earth. As I ran desperately to catch up to the light, the sound suddenly rose up behind me and over our heads in between the trees. This wasn’t happening. It was going to drop down on us. “Turn!” I screamed. I didn’t care anymore. If we were going to get out with our lives, we were going to have to run for them. We suddenly changed course, the tapping stopped for a moment, long enough for us to gain a few feet before it came in our direction again. My legs were cramping horribly and Chris was gasping hard. We couldn’t keep this up. Where were we? I saw the light from the lantern come to an abrupt halt up ahead, I didn’t have time to stop, and braced myself to thump into Chris, but the light passed beneath my feet. He had dropped the lantern. I turned my head and watched it recede into the darkness, it was immediately too far for me to go back, the thing would be on me in a second.
“Chris!” I was crying and wiping tears from my cheeks as I ran, preparing for my face to connect with a tree at any moment.
“Keep going!” I heard Chris cry from up ahead. “There’s a light!” My vision was bleary from tears but could see it, an orange glow hanging in the air in the distance. Another one? What was happening? I wanted to scream at him to avoid it, but I realized it was a street light. My legs felt like I was running through water, but I pushed them harder with a goal in sight. Gradually and painfully the light drew closer, as did the clicking. This thing could move like nothing I knew. I saw Chris’s figure pass underneath the street light and then he was gone again. “Don’t stop!” I yelled as I approached the edge of the forest, and my legs adjusted as the forest floor gave way to solid footing. I could see a row of more streetlights leading off to the right, and Chris’s figure was passing regularly underneath each.
When I was sure I was completely out of the trees I didn’t stop, I ran under several more street lights putting as much distance as I could manage between us and the edge of the woods. I realized after a while that the clicking had stopped, I needed to see we were ok. I turned my head and looked back along the row of lights, keeping my gaze on the first light. My pace slowed as the pain in my head and legs came back. There was silence once more, and the lights revealed an empty pathway. I jogged on and kept my eyes on the glow, expecting to see something at any minute, but it lit up nothing but concrete and the edge of the road.
“Is it there?” The question pulsed in my mind over and over. As I turned my head to continue catching up to Chris, I caught sight of something pass under the first street light. An almighty shock went through me as my fears were confirmed. I let out a cry and picked up the pace once more, sprinting between the lights. The image was burned into my mind. I hardly caught a glimpse of the thing, but it was white and massive. It nearly brushed the street light as it went under it. It had a long, upright body full of kinks, like it had just unfolded itself, and that’s all I was able to tell. It must have had a face and limbs, but I didn’t have time to see.
I didn’t look again, the path gave way to more lights and soon I could see the glow of windows in some houses either side of the road, I recognized where we were, close to my house by some miracle. A little further and we would be there.
“My house!” I yelled, and Chris listened, turning left onto a side street and dashing down. With panic on my side, I reached the turning and looked down the road to see Chris jumping the fence into my garden.
“Hurry up!” I heard him scream. Reaching the fence I planted my hands on top, hoisting myself over and shredding my elbows in the process. My ankles stung as I thudded into the garden, and sprinted towards the kitchen door. Chris stepped aside gasping for air as I fumbled the key into the lock and wrenched it sideways. We both flew into the kitchen and slammed the door behind us. I locked it from the inside and we both sprinted upstairs into the bathroom, locking it behind us.
“What was that!?” I managed to say in a panicked whisper, wondering if it would get in. “Did you see it?”
“No.” Chris crouched under the window, letting tears roll.
“Shit! It was so tall. It- It was- I couldn’t-”
“Don’t tell me” Chris cut me off.
I mulled it over again and again as we sat there, minutes slowly ticked by into hours. My head was fizzing all the while, and I could still hear its voice, that disgusting voice. My elbows and forearms were sticky with blood and we both looked at the floor, the occasional sob coming from the two of us. Our hearts banged in our chests, and we spent the night that way.
Light streamed in from the window, but we didn’t unlock the bathroom door until noon. We crept downstairs, the kitchen door was still locked and nothing was in the house. I looked out of the living room window, another perfect day. No people walked by, but the sprinklers were on and I could hear birds again. It helped to calm our nerves.
“That tent can stay there,” I said at last.
“Yeah.” Chris Agreed. We stayed in the living room with the TV off all day, we didn’t know what to do, and talked about if we should call the police or something. The day crawled by as we tried to rake our thoughts together and think of what to do next. But all that went through my mind was what had just happened, not what we should be doing. By the time it was dark at about 9 pm, the phone rang. It was Chris’s parents asking if I had seen him as they were getting worried, they had just got back from out of town. I let them know he was okay, and asked if they could come and pick us both up from my house because something had happened. They wanted to know what, but I said we’d both tell them when they get here. They said they’d be here soon. Relief washed over us as adults were on their way to make everything alright. They would believe us; we didn’t lie about these things. Even if they were skeptical, they’d at least believe that some dangerous animal was in the forest and that was good enough for us.
I went into the kitchen to get some juice from the fridge and realized I hadn’t had a drink all day. I could hear water dripping in the sink, so I turned the faucet tighter and glugged some juice. As I headed towards the living room, the water started to tap again. I flicked the light on and realized it wasn’t coming from the sink, or anywhere in the room for that matter. It sounded like it was coming from further away. I looked out into the garden, and could just about see a fuzzy, tall silhouette leaning up against the back fence in the dark. Actually, the tapping sounded more like clicking. The figure slowly moved away from the fence and clicked across the grass towards the house.

The Staircase	"July 5, 2010
I don’t really know what to say. Last week, I was in a bad car crash. The doctors said that I suffered some brain injuries in the crash and that it’s a miracle that I’m not dead. They also said that I needed to stay on top of things, especially when it came to memory. I guess I’m supposed to be writing in a “diary” for two months. Two whole months! I’m a man! Men don’t write in diaries!
But Doctor Schneider said that this would be good for me. I guess that means I’m gonna be writing for a while. It doesn’t have to be everything that I do every day; just one or two things that happen to me each day. So I guess day 1 is going to be my personal information.
My name is James Hunter. I live in Cheboygan, Michigan. It’s not a huge house. It’s basically just the upstairs and the basement. I have an attic, but I haven’t ever been up there. I guess one of my favorite things about this house is the fact that it’s secluded. I live out in the country, so no one ever goes past here. That makes it the perfect spot for murder!
I’m not a murderer. The truth is, I got this house for a really low cost because someone was murdered in it a year before I moved in. I don’t really know much about the murder, but I know that the body was found on the old wooden staircase that leads from the basement to the garage. Anyway, a young couple moved into the house six months later and left a month later when they found the basement steps broken. They were sure it was a ghost that broke the stairs. They found out later that the steps were old and rotten, and the husband fell through while he was sleepwalking, but they refused to move back in.
That’s why I moved here. I’m a huge fan of the paranormal. I saw my grandmother’s ghost appear at the foot of my bed once when I was 11 years old. Ever since then, I’ve been trying to get another ghost to appear to me. So far, no luck. However, I’m hopeful that this house will bring me the paranormal experience I crave so badly. In fact, when I moved in here on June 12 of this year, I spent my entire first night here examining that staircase. It’s actually very interesting… There apparently used to be access to the area under the steps for storage, but that was closed off when the staircase was remodeled. Now, it’s surrounded by walls of concrete, and I can’t even see through to the area underneath. The vertical wooden planks that connect to the horizontal ones fill up all the open space.
Sorry, diary. I know you didn’t want to hear some dumb ghost enthusiast talk about a creaky old staircase. I just hope that there is some actual paranormal activity going on here. I’ve been living here for a month now, and so far, no luck. Anyway, I think that’s plenty for one day. I’m going to go to bed now. Talk to you tomorrow! Ugh… I’m talking to my diary like it’s a person. I really am going insane. NOTE TO SELF: If you name this diary, I’m calling the men in the white jackets.
July 16, 2010
After 12 boring entries in this journal, I finally have something worth writing about! Something happened to me last night…something extraordinary. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep when I heard something coming from the basement beneath my room. It sounded like something heavy scraping across the cement floor. Excited, I jumped out of bed, grabbed the flashlight from my kitchen table, and rushed down the stairs to the basement. Naturally, the first thing I did was stand on the wooden staircase and scan the entire room. Nothing seemed out of place.
“Hello?” I asked the dark room. “Is someone there?” I waited for a while, but received no response. “Can I talk to whoever is here? I don’t want to hurt you. Can you tell me your name?” Again, I was answered with silence.
Curious as to what I heard move, I grabbed the biggest thing in my basement, which was the dryer, and pulled it away from the wall. It made a loud scraping sound, but it wasn’t quite like what I heard. I then tried the same thing with the washing machine, workbench, and treadmill, but none of these sounded right. The workbench sounded most like what I thought I heard, but it still didn’t seem right.
I stayed up until 3:30 this morning searching for answers, but there was still no evidence that a ghost was involved.

Call me crazy, if you want. Maybe I am crazy. I still have no clue who these comments are directed at. I guess I’ll just assume that Dr. Schneider will end up reading these journal entries. Anyway, I called in a psychic today. Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. “Doesn’t he know that psychics just scam your money?” Well, I’m not so sure.
The psychic’s name was Laurie Marvin. She came in early this morning to scan my house for spiritual activity. Surprise, surprise! She knew that something very dark had happened on those steps in the basement. I swear I didn’t tell her anything before she went down there! She said that she was getting a strong reading from a spirit named “Carlton” as she stood on the wooden staircase leading to the garage. That’s all that she could tell me. I asked if he meant me any harm, but she told me that she didn’t know. Still, “Carlton” is something to go on.
After Miss Marvin left, I decided that it was time for me to hit the internet and see if anyone named Carlton has died recently in Cheboygan. As it turns out, Carlton Mueller was the name of the man who was murdered by Tyler Frank, his business partner, on those wooden stairs last year. Who’s a fraud now, huh?
July 23, 2010
I know, I know… I’m sorry that I haven’t been writing in my journal recently. To tell the truth, I’ve been so busy with my new job as Cheboygan’s new newspaper editor that I haven’t had time. I figured that writing in newspapers was similar enough to writing in my journal that it would be okay. Dr. Schneider, however, told me yesterday that it was not okay, and that these journals are for my own benefit. He said that I’m supposed to be writing to help me remember my life. I guess it’s a little true… Ever since my entry on the 19th about going fishing with Jerry, my memory’s been a little foggy. I guess I’ll have to remember to write in this journal more often.
Oh well. I sincerely apologize to myself. I accept. Hooray. Cake and beer all around.
July 29, 2010
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! I’m so happy I could cry. Actually, I’ll be honest: I did cry. I wrote in my diary and I cried. But I don’t even care how girly that makes me sound anymore. I have seen the most amazing thing in my entire life!
I was lying in my bed last night when I realized that I had left the bathroom light on. So I rolled over and got out of bed. I opened up my bedroom door and looked down the hallway. What I saw actually almost made me wet my pants. It was a man. A grown man. He was standing on the other end of the hallway, just staring at my bedroom door. The light from the bathroom illuminated his face beautifully. He had a tall head with short, black hair. A few whiskers were scattered across his face, giving him a rugged, tired look.
“Hello?” I asked nervously. The man didn’t answer.
“Are you Carlton?” I forced the words out of my mouth.
To my delight, the figure nodded. I was talking to a ghost! I couldn’t believe it! Just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming, I pinched my arm as hard as I could. The intense pain convinced me that this was real.
“How did you die?” I inquired. Of course, I already knew the answer. I just wanted the ghost to speak to me. Sadly, he did not. He simply stared at me with steady eyes.
I don’t know how long Carlton and I looked at each other. It could have only been ten minutes, but it felt more like an hour. No matter what I asked, the ghost of Carlton Mueller would not speak to me. The only response I received from Carlton all night was when he nodded his head to confirm that he was, in fact, Carlton.
I finally returned to my bed after bidding Carlton goodnight. When I woke up this morning, he was gone.
August 3, 2010
Well, I was starting to get worried that Carlton wouldn’t show up again. Every morning that I wake up since I first saw him, I find the furniture in the dining room, living room, and basement completely rearranged. I knew that this was Carlton, and I didn’t care. Really. It’s just that… well, I wished he’d show his face again. And he did.
Last night, I was sleeping soundly when I heard something move in my room. I woke up and rolled over, expecting to see a chair on its side, courtesy of my good friend Carlton Mueller. Instead, I saw Carlton himself standing over my bed, staring down directly into my eyes. I nearly screamed, but I didn’t want to scare him away. So I quietly whispered, “Hello, Carlton.”
Carlton didn’t react. I asked him if he wanted me to wake up. Once again, he stood in place, like a statue. I tried to get him to answer me, but just like on the night of July 28th, he didn’t move a muscle. Finally, I sighed and rolled over.
I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I’m glad that I saw Carlton again. On the other hand, I definitely did not like the way he stood in the middle of my bedroom, staring at me while I slept. Who knows how long he was there after I fell asleep? More importantly, what if he stands there every night, and last night was just the first time I saw him? The malicious look in his dark eyes as he stared at me was… unsettling.
August 4, 2010
I couldn’t sleep last night. Yesterday, I thought that I wasn’t scared of Carlton. I thought that after a day, I’d have had enough time to get over it. Now, however, I’m positive that I am actually intimidated. In fact, “intimidated” is an understatement. I lay awake in my bed all night long, shaking like crazy. I couldn’t stand the thought of waking up and seeing Carlton watching me with such a malevolent glare again. I don’t know how Tyler Frank killed Carlton Mueller, but it must have been horrible. That is one pissed-off spirit.
But I can’t let my emotions control me like this. Writing in my journal may very well be the only thing keeping me sane after that incident, which is ironic, since I feel like I’m talking to myself. Regardless of whether or not I’m actually insane, I will not let Carlton’s presence in my house affect me like this. This is my house, not his. I shouldn’t have to leave just because of a ghost. More importantly, if I let him scare me like this, he will feed on my fear and, very likely, he will do it again. I really don’t want him to scare me again.
However, know this, Carlton. If you try to scare me again, I will not be afraid! I will not leave my house because of you, Carlton Mueller!
August 5, 2010
Well, this is a good reason to celebrate. It’s been a month since I was assigned this project, and that means I only have a month left. I would crack open a bottle of champagne if I wasn’t scared to death of going into the basement.
Last night, I didn’t sleep again. All night, I heard noises coming from the basement. I kept my bedroom door closed and locked, as if ghosts needed to use doors. I don’t know what Carlton’s doing down there, but it’s really annoying. At least I can rely on the fact that as long as he’s moving stuff around downstairs, he can’t be watching me upstairs. And all night long, I kept hearing that scraping noise over and over. That same scraping noise…
That’s another thing: I wish I knew what that was! I’ve completely rearranged everything in my basement since that first night when I heard Carlton, but nothing makes that specific sound. I just can’t figure out what it is. I am absolutely, 100% positive that nothing in my basement makes that noise. So what is it?
August 6, 2010
So, I saw Dr. Schneider yesterday again. He said that my head injury may have affected me worse than he originally thought. He said that insomnia might be due to brain damage. I laughed and explained that I’ve been staying awake because a ghost watches me when I sleep. For some reason, that didn’t comfort him.
August 14, 2010
I went downstairs. I finally got up the courage to go down into my basement. Of course, I didn’t see Carlton. There were no signs that Carlton had ever been down there. In fact, everything in the basement was exactly the way I left it when I last came upstairs. I was kind of hoping that I would see something out of place, so that I knew what Carlton was moving around down there.
Actually, it’s kind of odd. Every morning, I still find things in different places than where I left them. However, these occurrences are confined only to my living room, kitchen, dining room, guest bedroom, and bathroom. The basement and my bedroom remain untouched. Weird, huh?
Anyway, I’m glad that I went down to the basement. It made me feel safer being in the place I knew to be the source of Carlton’s ghost and yet experiencing nothing paranormal. It was somewhat comforting. I mean, I haven’t seen Carlton since he woke me up on the night of the 2nd. Maybe he knows that he scared me, and maybe he didn’t mean to. I’m starting to think that Carlton might not be such a bad guy after all.
August 21, 2010
I can’t handle this anymore. Every day I sit down at my desk and write down whatever it was that I did that day like some lab rat. I feel like a child who’s been ordered to color a picture. I am not Schneider’s damn lab rat.
Last night I left my door unlocked. It’s been almost 20 days since I saw Carlton in my bedroom, so I thought I might be safe. God, why am I so unlucky?
I woke up at 3:00 AM this morning and I knew instantly that there was someone standing over me. I slowly rolled over and, of course, saw Carlton. But he wasn’t standing in the same place he was in the last time he was in my room. This time, he was standing right over my bed.
He looked different than he had before, too. His hair was much messier than I remembered seeing it the first night. And his eyes… they made me shudder. They were surrounded by darkness, and the first thought I had when I saw them was “evil”. I had never really considered Carlton evil before last night. Maybe a troublemaker, a creeper, and a bit mischievous, but not evil.
I gasped loudly when I saw him. His reaction didn’t change, as usual.
“Carlton!” I nearly shouted. Remembering to keep my emotional distress to a minimum, I corrected my tone and continued, “Why are you here?”
As I predicted, Carlton didn’t reply.
“Please leave,” I said quietly, not breaking my eye contact with him.
Carlton’s eyes widened to a frightening size and his head tilted a little bit.
“No, no,” I said quickly, sitting up and backing up to the other side of my bed. “I didn’t mean that you should leave the house. I meant you should leave my bedroom. Please,” I added when Carlton’s eyes narrowed and his nostrils flared angrily.
“Look, I don’t want you to leave the house,” I insisted. “I want you to stay!” Very slowly and deliberately, Carlton moved around my bed to the side that I had crawled to. “But, you know, when I’m sleeping, that’s my time, Carlton!” When the ghost didn’t stop, I scooted back over to the side of the bed I woke up on.
“Carlton, please, don’t hurt me. I’ve never done anything to hurt you. Why would you go after me?”
Carlton didn’t answer. He walked quietly to the foot of my bed and stood there with his usual overseeing attitude. He didn’t leave until I fell asleep again. I woke up this morning and found my bedroom door open. I can’t live like this for much longer. If I can’t get Carlton out of this house, I’m going to have to move out and let someone else deal with him.
August 22, 2010
I locked my bedroom door again last night, and there was no sign of Carlton. I’m never unlocking that door again. I think Carlton thinks it’s my way of welcoming him into my bedroom. I just hope I didn’t hurt his feelings.
Wait, what am I saying? I hope I didn’t hurt the ghost’s feelings? That’s ridiculous! He came into my home, moved all my stuff, scared me to death, and I’m saying that I hope I didn’t hurt his feelings?
Forget that! I hope he went home to his ghost mama, cried ghost tears, ate a whole gallon of ghost ice cream, and ended up losing his ghost leg to ghost diabetes.
I don’t care what Carlton wants anymore. I want Carlton gone. It’s really too bad that he’s a ghost, because if he wasn’t, I’d wish he was dead. Then again, I think both Carlton and I would be happier if he was still alive.
August 28, 2010
The exterminator came over today to do spray his bug-killing stuff like he has every month since I’ve moved in here. While he was here, he decided to make my life even more miserable by telling me that I have a termite problem. Why the hell not? I mean, everything else in my life has gone wrong. My house has termites, my life is being tormented by an evil poltergeist, I may or may not have permanent brain damage, and I’m probably going insane because of all of this crap put together.
I want to die. At least then I’d be able to make someone else’s life as horrifying as Carlton has made mine.
But wait… I need to get my house fumigated. No, I’m not an idiot. I know that fumigating my house won’t kill a ghost. However, it will give me a good reason to move out for a day or two. I’ll sleep better than I have in my entire life if I can be sure that I won’t wake up with the ghost of Carlton Mueller standing over me.
August 29, 2010
Ah, sweet relief! I decided to move into my hotel room a little prematurely, and I couldn’t be happier! The instant I stepped into my room, I thought “This feels more like home than home does.” How about that?
But I only have a few days of this. My house is getting fumigated tomorrow, and the bug man said that I should be able to move back in on Tuesday, August 31st. But you know what? I might decide to stay here a little longer. It’s nice being able to sleep.
September 1, 2010
Today was the most disturbing day of my life. Yes, it was even more disturbing than when Carlton tried to attack me. I moved back into my house yesterday and slept in my bed. Of course, I locked my bedroom door. I thought that would keep Carlton out.
I woke up at 3:00 again this morning. I opened my eyes slowly, afraid of what I would find. However, quite predictably, Carlton was standing next to my bed. I sat up quickly. “Carlton, please, stay away from me!” I begged, but I realized quickly that Carlton wasn’t looking at me. He had been looking down at the floor with a sad expression on his face.
“What?” I asked, completely bewildered. When I said this, his head jerked up and his eyes pointed directly into mine. They seemed different, tonight, though. They were much less… hateful. After a moment, Carlton gestured for me to stand up.
“You want me to stand?” I asked. Without answering me, Carlton turned and walked straight through my locked door. I got up quickly and rushed to the door. Unlocking it, I pulled it open hastily and found Carlton standing just on the other side, staring at me as if he could see through the door. I jumped, but prevented myself from screaming.
Carlton turned around and walked down the hallway to the staircase. It was strange to watch him walk; his feet almost didn’t touch the floor, as if he was walking through a pool of neck-high water. Picking up on his urgency, I followed him through the hallway and down the stairs.
When Carlton stepped into the basement, I grew wary about following him any further. I had heard some stories that ghosts gained power when they were in the places they were killed. What if he wanted to kill me? My curiosity outweighed my caution, and I entered my basement.
With no hesitation, Carlton walked straight through the basement to the wooden staircase on which he was killed. He stopped right next to it and gestured for me to stand at the base of the first step. I did.
Carlton pointed to the third and fourth steps, and then gestured toward the ceiling.
“Am I supposed to… what, lift them up, or something?” I asked, confused. Carlton nodded.
I felt stupid doing it, but I tried anyway. To my surprise, as I pulled up on the third and fourth steps to the wooden staircase, they shifted slightly. I looked over at Carlton, who nodded stoically. I gulped, realizing that my mouth was uncomfortably dry. I fixed my grip on the steps and pulled up again. This time, they came off of the staircase in one piece with a loud scraping sound.
I knew that sound. I knew it so well. I heard it coming from my basement every night.
I looked inside the hole made from the lack of the third and fourth steps, but I couldn’t see anything. “Hold on,” I said to Carlton. “Let me go and get my flashlight.”
I dashed up the stairs, grabbed the flashlight from the kitchen table, and ran back down. Carlton was still standing in the exact same place he had been before I left. He pointed inside the hole. I knelt down and shone my flashlight through the stairs.
Inside, I saw a body. A dead body. I gagged and dropped the flashlight. It fell to the floor where it flickered and resumed its regular glow. Forcing myself to control my reflexes, I picked up the flashlight and aimed it at the body. It was a man’s body, and I saw the face clearly. I felt like my entire body was paralyzed. I knew that face.
I called the police immediately, and they were there within fifteen minutes. They investigated my entire house from top to bottom. They even searched the attic.
The sergeant, Dale Turner, asked me to give him a statement, so I told him exactly what happened.
“I woke up at 3:00, and there was a ghost at the end of my bed,” I said. I didn’t care if I sounded crazy. “He led me down the stairs and into the basement, where he showed me how to lift up these steps. So I did, and I found his body.”
“You found whose body?” Sergeant Turner asked. “The, uh… ‘ghost’s’?”
“Yes, it was the body of Carlton Mueller,” I told him. “I think his spirit’s been trying to communicate with me for a while. I’ve been seeing his ghost around my house for the past month, now.”
“Did you say ‘month’?” the sergeant inquired.
“Yeah, I first saw him on July 29. Ever since then, he kept showing up.”
“Mr. Hunter,” Sergeant Turner said quietly, “This man that you found… we’ve been looking for him for about two months now, but… he’s only been dead for a couple of days.”"	9.93	14.0	Christopher Gideon	01/18/2014
I Told You To Smile	"It was the 2nd of January, 2:04 AM. I woke up to a knocking on the door. One knock every three seconds. I slipped on my slippers and walked down the stairs. As I walked down, the knocking on the door got faster, almost like a heartbeat. When I got to the door, the knocking stopped. I looked outside and nobody was there.
I went back up to my room and went back to bed, thinking it was just some kids playing a prank. At 4:21 AM, I woke up to the front door slamming shut. I jumped, terrified. I looked over at my frosted window to find “smile” written all over it in the frost. I grabbed my phone, which was next to me, ready to call 9-1-1, only to find a message written on it, which read, “I told you to smile.” I cried and ran for my life, running outside.
As soon as I got outside, I sprinted to my neighbor’s house across the road, and I knocked on their door. They answered and held me while I sobbed. They phoned the police. At exactly 5:42, following an extensive search of my house, the police came to next door to see me. They told me there had been no evidence at all to suggest that anyone other than me had been in the house. The messages on the window were gone, same with my phone. They told me to get some sleep and advised me to see the doctor about stress and anxiety problems. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing! I knew that what happened to me was real.
The following evening, after spending the day at my neighbor’s, I went home. I went up to my bedroom and set up a camera. It was aimed at my bedroom door and my bed. I set it to record and went to sleep. Thankfully, I slept through the night. However, as I watched the footage, I couldn’t believe what I saw.
At exactly 3 AM, something crawled out from under my bed. It resembled an anorexic man, and it had no clothes on. He…it…whatever it was, stood up and looked at me lying there on the bed. It did so for another hour, not moving at all. Then it moved. It walked over to the camera until its face took up the whole shot. It was extremely pale and had bulging veins all over its head. Its eyes were completely black, and it had a huge smile on its face. It continued staring at the camera for another two hours, not blinking, just slightly twisting its head every now and again.
After two hours had passed, the thing walked back over to my bed and crawled back underneath. I skipped the video forward until it showed me getting up and walking over to the camera. The video finished. I was frozen with fear. The video showed him going back under, but not leaving. Whatever it was, it was still there."	9.63	16.0	Craig Groshek	12/22/2012
The Thing in the Window	"I’m pretty freaked out.
That thing has been there for almost a week. The figure in the window. It looks featureless, only skin on a human frame, and it’s pressing itself against the glass somehow. I don’t know how it got there, and I don’t know how to get rid of it.
At first I thought it was a prank, a doll or mannequin that some jerks put there to scare me. But I realized as I walked out of my house to pull it away… it wasn’t there. I shrugged it off, thinking that someone had hidden it while I was walking through my door. But I went back in and looked out that same window, and it was looking in, staring at me. I walked around my house, yelling for whoever it was to come out, but no one was there. The thing is hairless and naked, and it didn’t look like it actually had eyes, or even a face at all. But its head is turned towards me when I enter the room. When I sit on my computer, I can feel its faceless hatred boring into my neck. But when I turn around, it’s innocently turned in a different direction.
Finally on Thursday, I tried to open the window, but it’s stuck. I think the thing’s hands are keeping it down. But I got a good look at its face. Its eyes and mouth are behind the skin, pushing outward.
It stared at me, smiling.
I pulled back a fist and smashed it onto the glass, determined once and for all to get rid of the glaring monster. I know I’m strong enough. That glass should’ve cracked.
But it didn’t. It shuddered under my hand, but it didn’t break. And that smile just got wider and wider and wider, until I thought its head would break in half. It raised its own hand and bashed the window with its palm. It was mocking me. But I saw the faintest crack begin to appear where it had hit, and I backed away.
No way did I want that smile in the same room as me.
So I got a roll of duct tape, and I started covering the window. I couldn’t look directly at it; I nearly shit my pants just knowing it was watching me. But I couldn’t help it. I took a quick glance at that skin-covered face. A small peek.
It was angry.
That menacing grin was now a gaping frown full of teeth. The skin had ripped away from its mouth and I could see down its cavernous throat. A menacing rumble started to fill the house, and that hairline crack began to spread like splintering ice. I pulled down the duct tape. The rumble stopped, the split skin healed over, and it began to smile again.
Now it’s night, and the noise hasn’t started again. There are no sounds, no rumble, no crackling glass. Everything’s quiet now.
But I can feel its claws gripping the back of my chair. I can hear its skin stretching as it smiles
It’s watching me type."	9.64	14.0	Anonymous	12/15/2012
The Thing	"There were two young boys named Trevor and Will. They spent most of their summer vacation hanging around town, looking for things to do.
One hot August night, the boys were sitting on a fence by the main road. There was a cornfield just across the road. Suddenly, Trevor spotted something in the field. In the darkness, it was difficult to make out, but he thought it looked like some kind of weird animal.
He nudged his friend and pointed in the direction of the strange-looking figure. Will said he could see it, too. He wasn’t sure, but the mysterious thing seemed vaguely human.
The next thing they knew, the thing was gone. The boys craned their necks and scanned the field with their eyes. Out of the blackness, came the thing. It slowly walked over to the edge of the field before disappearing again.
Trevor and Will looked at each other, puzzled.
“What was that?” asked Will.
“I have no idea,” replied Trevor.
No sooner had he said that than Trevor felt a clammy hand on his shoulder. He turned around and found himself staring directly into the hideous face of the thing. He let out a yell of terror and surprise.
The rotting skin on the thing’s face was coming off in several places, revealing the bone underneath. For a moment, it just stared silently at Trevor with its dark sunken eyes. Then, it suddenly grabbed hold of his arm. Trevor felt its fingernails dig into his flesh as he wriggled out of its grasp.
The two boys leaped off the fence and ran down the road, screaming in horror. They didn’t stop running until they reached their homes. They tried to tell their parents and friends about the thing they had seen that night, but nobody believed them.
When Trevor woke up the next morning, the scratches on his arm were still there. After a few days, they got worse and worse. Trevor got sick and his parents took him to see a doctor. After examining his arm, the doctor told the boy it was infected and gave him some pills to take.
Unfortunately, Trevor’s condition got worse and worse. The infection spread to his entire arm and it wasn’t long before his flesh was rotting and falling off. He was taken to hospital but no matter what the doctors did, no treatment seemed to work. The infection spread throughout his whole body. Trevor was confined to bed and started to waste away.
It seemed like he was beyond help and as the days went by, he steadily grew worse and worse. His anguished parents could only sit at his bedside and cry as they watched their beloved son slowly rotting away before their eyes.
On the day that Trevor finally passed away, Will came to the hospital to visit him. When the boy walked into the hospital room and saw Trevor lying in bed, he was horrified. His friend looked exactly like the thing."	9.0	17.0	Anonymous	12/01/2012
